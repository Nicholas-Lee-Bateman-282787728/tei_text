            AN EARLY EDUCATIONAL REPORT.
            [The following document is taken from the Senate Journal for 1821, at the end of
                    the volume and under separate paging. It is the starting point of the most
                    important legislation on educational matters under the old constitution, and may
                    be said to be the beginning of our State educational system. It is reprinted
                    here because the original is rare and in many places can be read only by the use
                    of a magnifying glass.—EDITOR.]
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    THURSDAY MORNING,
                                        December 6, 1821.
                                
                        MESSRS. CASWELL, Todd and Welsh, from the committee
                                    appointed by the last General Assembly to prepare a bill
                                    providing for a regular system of education, now made the
                                    following report:
                        The committee appointed by a joint resolution of both Houses of
                                    the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, to. draft and
                                    report at the present session, "A bill providing for a
                                    general system of Education, ascending in a regular gradation,
                                    from Township Schools to a State Seminary wherein tuition shall
                                    be gratis, and equally open to all," respectfully beg
                                    leave to report, that they have had the subject under
                                    consideration—and fully reciprocating the sentiments
                                    expressed by the General Assembly, as to the importance of a
                                    general diffusion of learning and knowledge among the rising
                                    generation, particularly in a government, which, like ours, is
                                    bottomed upon public opinion, and where intelligence and virtue
                                    are the strong safeguards of the Republic; have given it all the
                                    attention which time and their various avocations would permit.
                        Your committee have to report that, owing to the sickness and
                                    death of part of their number, and the non-attendance of others,
                                    they have not only been deprived of the benefits anticipated
                                    from the well known talents and learning of those with whom they
                                    have had the honor to be associated; but those circumstances  have put it out of the
                                    power of your committee sooner to convene, that a greater
                                    portion of time, since the last session of the General Assembly,
                                    might have been devoted to the important duties enjoined upon
                                    them by the resolution. Although by the resolution of your
                                    honorable body, your committee were only instructed to report a
                                    bill providing for a general system of education, yet they have
                                    deemed the subject of sufficient importance to justify a brief
                                    report, showing the grounds of calculation upon which a bill,
                                    when reported, may eventually rest.
                        The donations made by the Congress of the 
                                        United States
                                    , for the benefit of Schools and a State University
                                    (although not without a consideration given on the part of the
                                    State, by a relin-quishment of the right of taxation for a
                                    limited time) are liberal in the extreme; and the Union
                                    collectively, although they can not control, have an indirect
                                    interest in their final appropriation. It is believed by your
                                    committee, that if a proper disposition be made of those
                                    donations, a permanent fund may be created, sufficient in amount
                                    not only to disseminate the general and more necessary branches
                                    of education in the several townships, but also to furnish such
                                    endowments to an university as with some assistance will enable
                                    this State to occupy, in a literary point of view, a highly
                                    respectable standing. But this, in the opinion of your
                                    committee, can not be expected immediately. High attainments in
                                    literature, are not the results of a moment; but like all other
                                    improvements, must be gradual and progressive. Your committee
                                    are deeply impressed with the importance of the first step which
                                    may be taken towards the accomplishment of the grand design.
                                    Should a hasty and improvident disposition be made of those
                                    funds, your committee are well aware that the error may be
                                    fatal; and that the grants of the General Government, so
                                    beneficial in their object and so liberal in their amount, will
                                    be rendered unavailing; thereby destroying the brightest
                                    prospects, not only of the present generation, but those which
                                    are to come after us. Under this view of the subject, your
                                    committee can not but feel, that they are travelling over
                                    consecrated ground; and they do not mean it as a commonplace
                                    remark, when they say that it is with diffidence they suggest a
                                    course of  measures, which,
                                    if finally adopted by the Legislature, must be pregnant with
                                    such importance consequences.
                        Your committee have been induced to lay before the General
                                    Assembly, the result of their deliberations, so far as they have
                                    progressed, that the committee on the subject of education, may
                                    be as early as possible in possession of the facts and
                                    calculations upon which they may be called to report, and which
                                    shew the foundation of the systems which have heretofore been
                                    adopted by the older States.
                        The State of Indiana is estimated by your committee, to contain
                                    twenty-two millions three hundred and twelve thousand nine
                                    hundred and sixty acres, including land and water.
                        From this amount, your committee have made the following
                                    deductions:

                              For that part of the State covered by the waters of
                                                Lake Michigan

                              For those lands embraced by Clark's grant
                              149,000
                           
                           
                              For reservation in 
                                                Knox
                                             and other counties
                              30,420
                           
                           
                              For lands reserved for the use of the University
                              46,080
                           
                           
                              Total amount of deduction

                              Amount of the whole area
                              22,312,960
                           
                           
                              Amount of deduction
                              
                                 *417,500
                           
                           
                               
                              21,895,460
                           
                        
                        From which aggregate amount, one thirty-sixth part is to be taken
                                    as lands appropriated for the use of schools, amounting to six
                                    hundred and eight thousand two hundred and seven acres.
                        These lands, or part of them, your committee would recommend,
                                    should be put in market as soon as practicable; and the
                                    situation of the country will justify the measure.
                        The following table will show what may be realized by such sale,
                                    at the relative prices of one dollar and twenty-five cents to
                                    five dollars per acre, provided the whole amount should be put
                                    in market and can be sold:

                        For the purpose of facilitating the sale of the aforesaid lands,
                                    your committee would recommend the establishment of one or more
                                    Land Offices at the discretion of the General Assembly, to be
                                    placed at such points as they may think most advantageous.
                        Whether these lands shall be sold for cash in hand, or upon
                                    credit, payable by instalments, your committee find some
                                    difficulty in determining.—In favor of a sale for
                                    cash in hand, it may be urged, that if the proceeds of the sales
                                    are funded, together with the interest at the expiration of each
                                    year, that the accumulation will be greater than can be realized
                                    from the extra price for which it is supposed the lands will
                                    sell, should a credit be allowed. Your committee, however, are
                                    inclined to think, that considering the present embarrassed
                                    state of the circulating medium of the country, the scarcity of
                                    the precious metals and the great amount of land now in market,
                                    that greater inducements will be held out to purchasers, should
                                    the lands be sold on a credit of four years, payable by
                                    instalments, according to the system heretofore adopted by the 
                                        United States
                                    ; and that the lands will command a price of more
                                    than sufficient to balance such accumulation.—But
                                    whether the accumulation of a debt existing between the
                                    government and the people and the consequent forfeitures which
                                    may be expected to follow such credits, are considerations  sufficient to overbalance
                                    the difference in price, your committee will not attempt to
                                    determine. Should the lands be sold for prompt payment and the
                                    proceeds, together with the annual interest, be put upon loan,
                                    the fund will rapidly increase in amount, and the yearly
                                    dividends will consequently be greater.
                        The following table will shew the ratio of increase, from one to
                                    ten years, from the different prices, from one dollar and
                                    twenty-five cents to five dollars per acre. [See next page.]
                        This table, together with the other, may probably contain some
                                    errors, and in no instance have the fractional parts of a dollar
                                    been calculated; but they are supposed to be sufficiently
                                    correct to answer all the purposes for which they are intended.
                        Should the legislature be disposed to fund the proceeds of the
                                    sales, it is believed by your committee, that at the expiration
                                    of six years, a sufficient dividend may be made to maintain a
                                    school in each school district, for the term of three months in
                                    each year, out of the public money alone.
                        Your committee are also of opinion, that a school for a shorter
                                    term than three months in each year, would not be calculated to
                                    promote the intended object, and that good teachers can not be
                                    obtained without great difficulty, for a shorter term. To effect
                                    this object, your committee would recommend that so soon as any
                                    money shall be received upon such sales, or upon instalments
                                    which may become due from time to time, that the amount be
                                    loaned upon mortgages of real estate, in small sums, the
                                    interest to be paid annually, which interest also be funded in
                                    like manner, at the expiration of each year, having special
                                    regard that the debt be perfectly secured, upon such landed
                                    estates as have an undoubted title, the amount of which shall be
                                    sufficient to secure the State against all possible losses. But
                                    should the dividends be immediately made after the first year,
                                    without further increase, the following table will shew the
                                    number of townships in which schools are eventually to be
                                    organized, the number of schools necessary, allowing nine square
                                    miles to each school district, the amount of dividend for the
                                    first year, at the relative prices; also the amount which may be
                                    divided, should the fund be permitted to accumulate for the term
                                    of six years.

                        It is impossible for your committee to determine the amount of
                                    money which may be raised by selling the lands upon credit and
                                    funding the instalments, as they become due; but it is presumed
                                    the amount will be less than upon a cash sale. The above
                                    calculations are made upon the supposition of a sale of the
                                    whole of the lands; but as the proportion of school lands is the
                                    same throughout the State; the dividend in each township will be
                                    the same, although no sales should be effected, but in a more
                                    settled part of the country.
                        In determining the number of schools which may be necessary
                                    throughout the State, your committee have allowed nine square
                                    miles to each district, which will give to each township four
                                    district schools.
                        
                        If these are properly located, the extreme distance which any
                                    children will have to travel to attend school, will be but
                                    little more than one mile and one half. This calculation, it is
                                    presumed, will suit the present population of this State; but in
                                    the State of 
                                        New York
                                    , the law provides for the establishment of a school
                                    upon every four square miles, and if we allow to every quarter
                                    section of land four children, between the ages of four and
                                    sixteen years, the number would be sixty-four in every school
                                    district; a number sufficiently large, in the opinion of your
                                    committee, for advantageous improvement. Upon that calculation,
                                    nine school districts, instead of four, would be necessary in
                                    each township, which will consequently increase the number from
                                    three thousand eight hundred to eight thousand five hundred and
                                    fifty. It is the opinion of your committee, that the present
                                    population will not require a greater number than four, and the
                                    change can be made whenever the situation of the country shall
                                    require it. Your committee would therefore recommend, that a
                                    school district be located and established upon every territory
                                    of land comprising nine square miles whenever the population in
                                    such township and the situation of the school funds will justify
                                    it; the location to be made as nearly central within the
                                    district as may be.
                        Another system of rendering donation lands productive, has been
                                    adopted in many parts of the 
                                        United States
                                    , which is that of leasing the lands, either
                                    permanently, or for a life or lives. But the same beneficial
                                    results have not been here as in Europe.
                        In 
                                        England
                                     all lands are held by that kind of tenure, and the
                                    immense population of that country are not left to their choice
                                    of titles. The privileges attendant upon a fee simple interest,
                                    are not within the reach even of the wealthy; and although the
                                    existence of the people in a great measure depends upon a
                                    preservation of the timber and a proper cultivation of the soil,
                                    yet even there, the restrictions and forfeitures attendant upon
                                    those estates, are often considered burthensome and oppressive.
                                    If the sole object of the farmer were the accumulation of
                                    wealth, it will not be denied by your committee, that leases
                                    would be preferred; for it is believed that the individual who
                                    pays during his life the annual interest of five dollars per
                                    acre, by way of ground rent, pays a less sum than the purchaser,
                                    who advances his purchase 
                                    money, although he should buy the land at a much less price than
                                    five dollars per acre. But the independence attached to a fee
                                    simple interest, it is hoped, will long be cherished by every
                                    freeman, as one of his dearest rights.
                        It is believed, by your committee, that the great mass of
                                    individuals, who would make good tenants, will prefer the
                                    allodium, and they can not but be strongly impressed with a
                                    belief, that even permanent leases will not protect the property
                                    of the State from destruction, unless restrictions are imposed
                                    upon tenants, which might be considered incompatible with the
                                    principles of a free government. Should restrictions be imposed,
                                    much danger is to be apprehended in progress of time, from
                                    litigation and disputes, which may arise between the government
                                    and the people, should the system of leasing be adopted. If the
                                    tenants hold the lands without impeachment of waste, the
                                    experience of our sister States furnishes ground of fear, that
                                    after a few years, those tenants will find it convenient to quit
                                    the premises, not only leaving rent in arrear, but doing such
                                    damage to the lands as will place it beyond the power of the
                                    State, either to sell or lease them for many years. This system
                                    of leasing is also more objectionable here than in many of the
                                    eastern and northern States.
                        In most parts of that country, the second growth of timber is
                                    more thrifty than the first, and lands which were cleared of
                                    timber in the year eighteen hundred, have now a sufficient
                                    growth upon them to answer all the common purposes of life. But
                                    your committee would enquire, whether the experience of this
                                    country as to the second growth of timber, will justify such an
                                    expectation, as it regards the greater portion of lands in this
                                    State.
                        As an answer to these objections, it may be urged, that the tide
                                    of emigration is steadily flowing to the West, and that the
                                    future population of the State will justify the expectation,
                                    that tenants of a better class will soon be numerous. But it
                                    must be recollected, that the field for emigration is also
                                    immense and that the tide will probably continue to roll on over
                                    the western wilds, until it reaches the Pacific
                                    Ocean; so that little change can be expected until
                                    the long distant ebb shall return upon us a redundant
                                    population.
                        
                        Your committee are however apprised, that many of your honorable
                                    body entertain different sentiments, as to the best methods of
                                    rendering the school funds productive and have therefore
                                    prepared a table, shewing what amount may probably be realized,
                                    by selling the lands at auction to the highest bidder, the
                                    purchaser paying annually, the interest of the amount he shall
                                    bid for the land, also shewing the increase of that fund by a
                                    loan of the amount of interest, from year to year, for the term
                                    of six years.
                        
                           
                              Suppose the lands to be sold at $3,50 per
                                            acre, the purchaser paying annually the interest of the
                                            amount of sale, the yearly amount to be paid for a
                                            quarter section would be twenty-one cents per acre,
                                            which is equal to

                        In order that a regular system of education may be adopted
                                    throughout this State, and that the public funds shall not be
                                    improperly appropriated; your committee would recommend, that
                                         a board of inspection
                                    be appointed, in each county where schools are to be
                                    established, whose duty it shall be, to examine the
                                    qualifications of all teachers, who may be offered by the
                                    trustees of the several school districts for employment, and
                                    shall give the person applying, a certificate of qualification,
                                    if they find his acquirements such as will justify such
                                    certificate, and that in no instance, the trustees of such
                                    school district be authorized to receive the dividends
                                    appropriated by law, for the payment of such teachers, unless
                                    the person by them employed to teach such school shall first
                                    have received such certificate. Your committee would further
                                    recommend, that it be made the duty of such inspectors, some or
                                    one of them, at least twice in each session, to visit and
                                    examine the several schools in their county, with a view of
                                    ascertaining the manner in which said schools are taught, and
                                    the improvements made in the several branches of education.
                        This course is suggested under a belief, that a public
                                    examination is calculated to excite vigilence in the
                                    instructors, and a spirit of emulation, among the youths under
                                    their charge.
                        Should strict attention be paid to the organization and
                                    improvement of township schools, they may become nurseries of
                                    teachers, for the wide extent of country yet to be settled.
                        Your committee would further suggest, that no person shalr be
                                    considered as a competent teacher of such district school,
                                    unless he be of good moral character, and well versed in
                                    reading, writing, arithmetic, English Grammar. Geography and
                                    surveying.
                        Your committee have been more particular as to the qualifications
                                    of instructors, from a belief that few persons will feel
                                    themselves able to educate their sons at the University, and
                                    your committee have considered the above qualifications as
                                    indispensible to a good education.
                        The annual fund for the benefit of township schools, it is
                                    presumed, will not be more than sufficient to pay the
                                    instructors who must necessarily be employed, upon the system
                                    which has been suggested.
                        Towards the further accomplishments of the great object, your
                                    committee would recommend, that the qualified electors within
                                    the bounds of each school district, when organized for certain
                                    purposes, be a body politic and corporate, with power by their
                                         vote to levy and
                                    collect a sufficient tax, to erect suitable buildings for the
                                    purpose of a school, and also by their vote to levy and collect
                                    a tax sufficient to maintain a school in such district, for any
                                    portion of time in each year which they may think proper, in aid
                                    of the general appropriation from the common fund.
                        Your committee are aware, that to compell the people of a
                                    district to support a school against their will, might be
                                    considered an infringement of their natural rights, but if each
                                    school district is left at liberty to adopt or reject such tax,
                                    it can not, in the opinion of your committee, be considered
                                    either burthen-some or oppressive.
                        As to the quality of buildings to be erected, and the time for
                                    which such schools shall be kept, they are left at liberty to
                                    determine, and of their comparative poverty or wealth, may be
                                    sole' judges.
                        Your committee would recommend, that the internal police and
                                    management of such schools be intrusted (in addition to the
                                    board of inspection and instructor, as aforesaid) to a suitable
                                    number of trustees to be elected by the qualified electors in
                                    each district, who shall have power to employ teachers, furnish
                                    fuel and other necessaries for the school, and to exercise a
                                    general superintendence over the concerns of said district.
                        ON THE SUBJECT OF COUNTY SEMINARIES.
                        As to the monies arising from fines, forfeitures and commutations
                                    for military service, your committee beg leave to enquire,
                                    whether the laws upon those subjects may not need amendment, and
                                    would respectfully advise, that they be made as efficient as
                                    practicable, for ascertaining the correct amount, and for
                                    securing and collecting the monies annually.
                        The amount of these monies, either on hand or now due, your
                                    committee can not, for want of sufficient data, with any
                                    precision conclusively state, but conjecture that the following
                                    estimates may not be far from correct:
                        From examinations had of the reports of agents for county
                                    seminaries, of twenty-six counties, for eighteen hundred and
                                    twenty, and including the previous years, the amount is stated
                                    at three thousand dollars, and for the year one thousand eight
                                         hundred and twenty-one,
                                    from six counties, at two thousand and sixteen dollars, making
                                    an aggregate of five thousand and sixteen dollars, as now
                                    reported.
                        Your committee, however, feel pretty confident that, upon a more
                                    full and careful investigation of the subject, there will be
                                    found due to the State, a much larger sum.
                        With regard to the establishment of county academies, your
                                    committee beg leave to enquire, whether the following plan may
                                    not be expedient, viz. That your Honorable body should, by law.,
                                    make it the duty of the several townships, in each county, to
                                    elect one trustee for each township, and resident therein, to be
                                    a member of the board of such academy, whenever the county funds
                                    for that purpose, will authorize the establishment of such an
                                    institution, and that as soon as there shall have been a regular
                                    and fair return made from each township, of the persons elected
                                    in it for a trustee, certified by the clerk and judges of the
                                    election, to the clerk of said county, whose duty it shall be to
                                    record the same, and the several trustees so elected shall have
                                    taken an oath, faithfully to discharge the duties of a trustee
                                    in such county academy, such board shall then be in law and in
                                    fact a body politic and corporate, either as it respects
                                    prosecution or defense, the acquisition or disposal of property,
                                    the choice of a teacher, or any other act, calculated to promote
                                    the interest of such academy, and corresponding with the
                                    original laws and constitution of the State of Indiana on that
                                    subject.
                        Your committee would, however, further recommend, that such
                                    academies should always be subject to any constitutional
                                    alterations, which the legislature may from time to time see
                                    proper to make.
                        Your committee further beg leave to recommend, a sale of the
                                    college lands upon the same principles heretofore suggested, as
                                    to the lands reserved for the use of the township schools, and
                                    the funding the proceeds in like manner.
                        It is believed by your committee, that five dollars per acre, be
                                    a fair price to establish as a medium for the whole, under this
                                    view they submit the following table, which will shew the amount
                                    of lands, so far as your committee have been able to as-  certain them, the amount of
                                    money which may be realized on such sale, the yearly
                                    accumulation of the fund, and the total amount at the expiration
                                    of six years. In this calculation, the interest is added to the
                                    principal and loaned at the expiration of each year.

                        With regard to an University for the State, contemplated in the
                                    law making provision for the promotion of literature, and the
                                    organization of such an institution, your committee recommend
                                    the passage of a law for establishing it, to be known by the
                                    name of the University of Indiana, and that a board of trustees
                                    be selected with great care, and appointed by law to superintend
                                    its interest.
                        Your committee think, that to appoint as great a number as  are found composing the
                                    eastern boards, might not be advisable, and would for different
                                    reasons which might be assigned, tend rather to embarrass and
                                    retard the operations of such an institution, than give them
                                    facility.
                        Your committee would respectfully suggest the number of thirteen,
                                    besides the Governor and Lieut. Governor, who shall be trustees
                                        ex officio, a majority of whom having
                                    regularly met any time, shall form and be a quorum, for
                                    business; and that this board, constituted a body corporate and
                                    politic, should afterwards have authority to fill their own
                                    vacancies whenever they occur. That it should be the duty of
                                    this board, to appoint and manage all the interests of the
                                    institution, to select and employ a President, professors,
                                    tutors, a Librarian, Stuard, etc.
                        Should the funds not be considerably increased, either by
                                    legislative aid or otherwise, beyond what a fair interest for
                                    five or six years will make them; your committee are of opinion
                                    that the most expedient plan as introductory to an University,
                                    will be to establish a College first: In that case, to make it
                                    respectable or indeed useful, it is respectfully suggested, that
                                    it will be necessary to place a President at the head of it,
                                    whose duty it shall be, besides exercising a general
                                    superintendency, to participate personally in giving instruction
                                    to the highest or first class in College, Logic, Metaphysics,
                                    Moral Philosophy and Criticism—2d, A professor of
                                    Mathematics and natural Philosophy—-3d, a professor
                                    of Geography, ancient and modern, and astronomy, as also, 4thly,
                                    a professor of the Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages, with one
                                    or more assistant tutors.
                        But should the funds be auspiciously managed and augmented, then
                                    and in that case, your committee take the liberty, prospectively
                                    of submitting it as their opinion, that a variety of other
                                    additions, to the merely literary departments should also be
                                    made.
                        Should it therefore, in a pecuniary point of view be found
                                    practicable, your committee would further respectfully suggest,
                                    the propriety of adding a professorship of Theology, with one of
                                    the law; together with a Medical School, to be conducted by its
                                    proper Professor.
                        
                        In this department of the University, your committee beg leave to
                                    recommend the following arrangement: 1st, Clinecal proper; 2d,
                                    one on the materia medica, botany and natural history; 3d, one
                                    of chemistry; 4thly, one on physiology, anatomy and obstetricks,
                                    and 5thly, one of surgery.
                        The whole, both in the literary and other departments, forming a
                                    Faculty, and reciprocally aiding each other in preserving order,
                                    and giving dignity to the institution.
                        When the committee recommended these last variety of additions to
                                    the College, they are aware from their instructions, that a
                                    gratuitous education is intended by the legislature in the
                                    merely literary departments, and from the lowest of them in a
                                    common school, to the highest in an University.
                        In correspondence with this legislative intention, the committee
                                    have made their calculations for a term of years not exceeding
                                    six, when according to the estimates of the committee, the
                                    aggregate amount as will be seen from the tables, will be
                                    $260,772, from this amount 60,772, may then safely be
                                    employed: Say 40,000 dollars of it in erecting a building and
                                    the balance, 20,772 dollars, in obtaining a Library and a
                                    Philosophical and Chemical Apparatus, in such portions of each
                                    as may then be found most expedient.
                        After this deduction is made, it will be seen, that there will
                                    remain as a permanent fund of dolls. 200,000, the annual
                                    interest amount of which is dolls. 12,000 which, allowing the
                                    President dolls. 2,000 per annum, and to Professors each, dolls.
                                    1,200, and to the two tutors, each, dolls. 600, W. The whole
                                    amount of expenditures on the teachers will amount to
                                    $6,800, leaving a balance yearly, of five thousand
                                    two hundred dollars, for appropriation in whatever way may be
                                    deemed best.
                        The committee submit it to the consideration of the legislature,
                                    whether it might not be advisable to appropriate annually
                                    $1,000 of the remaining $5,200 to increase
                                    the library.
                        With regard to the internal police, in any of the public
                                    institutions, from the Academy to the University, your committee
                                    have thought it would be premature in them to suggest any thing
                                    on that subject.
                        
                        All the laws and regulations customary and necessary in the
                                    different departments in the College or University, must
                                    naturally and with propriety grow out of the authority with
                                    which your honorable body may be pleased to clothe the board of
                                    trustees, and with the exception of the tutors, all the various
                                    grades of instruction of each of them.
                        Your committee having thus briefly stated the result of their
                                    deliberations upon the several subjects indirectly involved in
                                    the resolution of your honorable body, would respectfully
                                    inquire, whether the public good imperiously demands that a
                                    further report should be made at the present session, or whether
                                    a vacation might not consistently be allowed your committee, or
                                    some one of them, or some other person to prepare a bill so
                                    tedious in detail as the organization of the different schools.
                        Your committee have preserved the materials which will greatly
                                    facilitate the drafting such bill, and wish to hold themselves
                                    subject to the will of your honorable body, but they humbly
                                    conceive, that until the General Assembly devise the means of
                                    rendering school funds productive, a bill organising schools,
                                    academies and universities, can not be material.
                        Your committee would further suggest to your honorable body that
                                    they have opened a communication with the heads of department of
                                    those States, where schools have been organized by public
                                    authority, as also with some of the most respectable literary
                                    institutions, in the 
                                        United States
                                    ; from which sources they expect to receive such
                                    documents as will greatly facilitate the accomplishment of so
                                    desirable an object.
                        Those documents, together with the time which will be allowed for
                                    reflection and study, in the opinion of your committee are
                                    important, and ought not to be dispensed with, unless existing
                                    cause, not within the knowledge of your committee, render a

            THE CIVIC VALUE OF LOCAL HISTORY.
            BY ARTHUR W. DUNN
            [Read before the Ohio Valley Historical Association at
                            
                  Marietta, Ohio
               , November 29, 1908.1
            MY paper today has nothing to do directly with research into local history, to
                    stimulate which is one of the primary purposes of this association; but it has
                    reference to the use of local history in the school curriculum, a subject which
                    should have an equal claim upon our attention.
            The importance of local historical research is steadily gaining recognition, and
                    is reflected in a growing belief that local history should have a place in the
                    course of study. The question of how to make use of it in the schools to the
                    best advantage, however, has not yet been definitely answered. Down to the
                    present time its use in the education of children has been, for the most part,
                    unsystematic, and unfruitful of results commensurate with its possibilities and
                    value.
            This unsystematic and fragmentary use of local history in the schools is due in
                    part to a lack of materials in available form. On the other hand, a truer
                    conception of the values of local history as a study, and an intelligent effort
                    to make a better use of the materials at hand, will inevitably stimulate a
                    greater interest in the collection of adequate material, and in putting this
                    material in available form. For example, the attempt to use local history
                    systematically in the schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                     during the last two years, and the discovery of a lack of adequate
                    material in available form, led the Commercial Club to appropriate a sum of
                    money to meet the situation. When the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Water Company found that the children were striving earnestly, but
                    in vain, to get accurate information regarding the 
                        Indianapolis
                     water supply, this company voluntarily prepared a brief but well
                    written account of the history of the water supply, and the present organization
                    of its system, and is now cooperating in the preparation of a complete history
                    of the subject.
            
            The real causes of the difficulties in the use of local history in the schools
                    are, in my mind, two:
            
               A misconception of what constitutes useful local history; and
               Failure to see how to introduce it in a course of study that is already
                        criticised as being overcrowded.
            
            The second difficulty may be largely cleared up by a proper answer to the first.
            What is local history?
            Have you never heard people in the West assert that western localities have no
                    history worthy of the name? What have we in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , for example, that is worthy of historical research, in the sense
                    that we find such matters in 
                        Boston
                     or 
                        Philadelphia
                    ? Indeed, we are inclined to look with envy upon 
                        Cincinnati
                     and Marietta and our own 
                        Vincennes
                    , because these places have a local history that we have not. What
                    conception is this that permits such a feeling? It is due to a common notion
                    that local history, to be worthy of the name, must have a manifest bearing upon
                    some great national movement. The great movement of the: Revolution or of our
                    national beginnings can not be studied without having our attention focused
                    constantly upon 
                        Boston
                     and 
                        Philadelphia
                    ; and the story of the Northwest Territory must take into account
                            
                  Marietta, Cincinnati
               , and 
                        Vincennes
                    . But where in our histories of the 
                        United States
                    , or even of the Northwest, do we find it necessary to refer to 
                        Indianapolis
                    ?
            What I mean is, that local history is too often considered as a mere appendage to
                    general history; and when that is the case it is bound to be disorganized,
                    disconnected and inadequate. It is a narrow view of local history that takes
                    into account only those events that are of national importance.
            On the other hand, there are those who see in local history only a chronicle of
                    events that have, usually, little interest to anybody but those who participated
                    in them, or their families. The sort of thing I have in mind may contain good
                    historical material, but as we find it, it seldom has much value, especially in
                    the schools; though it may be interesting to the antiquarian society. In 
                        Indianapolis
                     it has been a subject of serious debate,  for example, whether the first actual settler in
                    that locality was one George Pogue, who was afterward killed by tile Indians, or
                    the brothers McCormick. Each of these claimants has violent partisans. It is
                    conceivable that something important might hinge on the correct solution of this
                    problem. But as a matter of fact it is of no importance to any one, and of
                    comparatively little interest to few, which way this question is settled.
            The first idea that I wish to emphasize is that every community of whatever age
                    or size, has a local history that is instructive. Each has its own life story
                    which is full of vital interest and instruction, although from the viewpoint of
                    general history it may have no apparent significance. The old proverb that
                    "a prophet is not without honor save in his own country" has
                    its application to local history. It is a valuable lesson to learn that the
                    homely things of everyday life, the familiar facts of local environment, have
                    truths for us as significant as those of far-away places and remote times.
            The first thing we in the schools need to do, to solve the problem of local
                    history in the course of study, is to find the proper point of view
                        from which to approach the subject.
            The customary way of approach has been through the general course in 
                        United States
                     history; or, we might say more properly, the only use we ordinarly
                    find for local history is for the illumination of national history. It goes
                    without saying that there is opportunity for local history in this
                    connection—indeed, much greater opportunity that we commonly make use
                    of. Severtheless, it seems to me that the opportunity here is inadequate. In
                    addition to the fact that the history of most communities rarely has a vital
                    relation to the main current of general history as we study it in the public
                    schools, the time limitations of the history work in the schools usually make it
                    difficult to pause for what too often seems a digression in the field of local
                    history. At any rate, I believe I am safe in saying that, as a matter of fact,
                    very few history teachers make any systematic and organized
                    use of local history.
            Indeed, it might often be easier to weave a considerable body of national history
                    into a background of local history, than it is to weave the local into the
                    national; just as it is possible to 
                    organize general history about the biography of some public man, when there
                    would be little opportunity to introduce much of the life of the man into the
                    general history of his times. Thus, it would be impossible to write the life of
                    James G. Blaine without involving most of the important political events of his
                    time; but a general history of Blaine's time would afford little space
                    to his life. He would lose his identity in the general movement.
            This suggests the possibility of introducing into the curriculum a specific
                    course in local history. Such a course could be made to unfold the fundamental
                    principles of historical development almost as well as any other course in
                    history. It would contain the universal motives to human action; the universal
                    geographical conditions and influences; the law of development from the simple
                    to the complex, from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous; the evolution of
                    institutions to meet human needs. The fact that it deals with the near at hand
                    and the familiar would tend to arouse a vital interest, as a study of the remote
                    and unfamiliar does not. And it would afford opportunity, as already suggested,
                    to weave in many phases of general history that would perhaps not be dealt with
                    in the regular course in 
                        United States
                     history.
            But the introduction of a specific course in local history is open to two serious
                    objections. The local history of most communities is not sufficiently varied and
                    extensive to warrant spending much time on it as an end in itself; and the
                    course of study is already subjected to the criticism of over-crowding.
            It seems to me clear that local history in the schools must find its opportunity
                    as a means to an end, rather than as an end in itself. We must find an
                    economical way of utilizing it to further other ends in education, but of
                    utilizing it in as systematic and coherent a manner as possible. I wish to offer
                    a suggestion as to horn this may be done, and I shall draw upon our experience
                    in the public schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            First of all, let me say briefly that local history is furnishing the materials
                    for some of the English work of the Junior year in Shortridge High School. In
                    this case the word local applies to the entire State, and not merely to the
                    locality of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The classes are doing creative work along the line of  dramatization, and they have been turned into the
                    field of local history for the incidents to be reproduced. The work is under the
                    direction of an able and enthusiastic teacher, and her aim is to have produced
                    at the end of the year a pageant of Indiana history in simple dramatic form. The
                    pupils are doing more industrious and enthusiastic work in local history that I
                    have ever seen done in connection with an historical course, and they are doing
                    it in order to get materials for a definite object.
            Another illustration of the use of local history for other than historical ends
                    may be taken from the lower grades—about the fourth grade, as I
                    remember it. A few years ago one of our most skilful teachers of geography,
                    bIrs. Ida Stearns Stickney, prepared for her own use in teaching local geography
                    to young children a simple account of the founding and early years of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , weaving into it well-selected descriptions of the geographical
                    conditions, derived from the accounts of the early settlers themselves. The idea
                    was to give to the children a vivid picture of the natural conditions of the
                    land in their relations to the life of the people.
            About the time that this local geographical work was well under way, a
                    reorganization of the courses in the eighth grade and the first year of the high
                    school occurred, and a course in elementary civics was introduced in the eighth
                    grade. The nature of this course in civics will appear as we proceed, but its
                    purpose is to develop in the child an understanding of the nature of community
                    life, and a sense of his civic relations. This course was planned with definite
                    reference to the use of local history to illustrate, in the simplest terms
                    possible, the fundamental principles of community life. It was therefore
                    suggested to Mrs. Stickney that she elaborate her account of early geographical
                    conditions, telling the complete story of the first few years of the existence
                    of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and emphasizing every important phase of community life as seen
                    there. The result of her labors was the delightful little brochure,
                    "Pioneer 
                        Indianapolis
                    ," which is now doing excellent service in the schools.
            The literary merit of Mrs. Stickney's work was such (a thing unusual in
                    local histories) that it was adopted as supplementary reading in the sixth
                    grade. Thus, we now have in use in our 
                    schools, as an aid to the work in geography, civics and reading, in the fourth,
                    sixth and eighth grades, a coherent and well-organized history of a certain
                    period of the growth of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            The influence of this little local history extends even farther than the schools.
                    The idea interested the directors of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Commercial Club to such an extent that they shared the expense of
                    its publication with the Board of School Commissioners, copies being distributed
                    to all the 1,600 members of the club. It was published as the first number in a
                    series of Civic Studies of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , other numbers of which are to be historical, and some of which are
                    in course of preparation, as, for example, "The 
                        Indianapolis
                     Water Supply, Past and Present."
            My chief purpose is to show how local history may be utilized as a means of civic
                    instruction; and how, because of its usefulness in illuminating fundamental
                    civic ideas, it may find its own opportunity for development in connection with
                    a well-organized course in civics.
            The one great function of the public school is to train for citizenship, which
                    means, not merely the preparation of the youth for political activities, but the
                    transformation of the individual into an efficient member of the community. And
                    yet, in our work of education we fail to give enough attention to the real civic
                    end, and to arouse in the children a consciousness of this end. We neglect to
                    develop in the child the habit of thinking of himself as a member of a
                    community, and the habit of acting with reference to community efficiency. The
                    entire work of the school, and the entire organization of the school life,
                    should contribute to the end of establishing in the mind of the child a
                    consciousness of his civic relations in this broad sense. But there is need for
                    specific instruction along this line; and this is the function of civics.
            Our work in civics does not begin with an objective analysis of the machinery of
                    government, abstracted from its relations to the community life; but it begins
                    from the subjective standpoint of the child himself as a member of the
                    community. The child is led to see that the community arrangements have been
                    developed in order to aid him (and others) to satisfy their wants; he is led to
                    see that certain of these arrangements, such as the  school, and especially government, have been
                    evolved to meer his own needs by securing harmonious action, by preventing
                    conflict of interests; step by step he is led to realize that that community is
                    best to live in where the wants of each individual are most fully satisfied, and
                    where there is as little conflict of interest as possible. The aim of civics is
                    to impress the child with a sense of what the community does for him, and how it
                    does it, and with a sense of his own responsibility to the community as a
                    participator in its benefits and obligations.
            I am aware that this is attributing to civics a broader scope than is customary;
                    but I believe that this is right. For good citizenship is nothing more nor less
                    than efficient membership in the community in the relationships of neighbor, of
                    the family. of business, as well as in the political relationships. Government,
                    however,—local, State and national,—is a unifying thread
                    that runs throughout the entire course, and it is constantly-brought into the
                    foreground—but always in its proper perspective, and in its proper
                    relations to the varied life of the community.
            The first step in a course of civics of this kind is to try to develop in the
                    child's mind a conception of the nature of community life and its
                    relations. In order that the conception may be vivid, the child's study
                    is directed, not to communities in the abstract, but to the particular community
                    in which he lives. Reliance is placed largely upon direct observation and
                    analysis of the concrete facts with which the child is familiar, working out
                    from this to the less familiar and the general.
            The opportunity for local history comes in this connection. The fully developed
                    modern community is complex in the extreme, and it is not easy for the child to
                    grasp its details of organization and functional, or to understand his own
                    relations to it. It becomes imperative to establish a sense of these relations
                    with reference to a community of simpler form. This may be done in part by
                    constantly using the class itself, or the school, or the family, as
                    illustrations; for these social groups, especially the family, do possess the
                    essential characteristics of the full-fledged community. We endeavor to keep the
                    community idea prominent in the organization and conduct of our classes for this
                         purpose. But since the object of study
                    is the larger community of which the child is a member, the problem is to
                    present its relationships in a form simple enough for him to comprehend. This
                    can be done by the use of local history.
            In order to illustrate this idea, let us suppose that we have in 
                        Indianapolis
                     an eighth grade class in civics. We have begun by an attempt to
                    develop in the minds of the class a preliminary, but fairly clear, idea of the
                    meaning of "community." It is brought out by discussion and by
                    a consideration of various kinds of communities, that there must be first of
                    all, of course, a group of people; that this group of people must occupy a
                    common area of land, that is, have a common territory; that the group of people
                    have come together in this common territory because of common interests; and
                    that their conduct as a group is regulated by common laws which emanate from
                    some form of government. The constant presence of these factors in community
                    life is illustrated by the class, the school, the family, the neighborhood, the
                    city, the State and the nation. It might be said that the word community is used
                    in this course because of its elasticity, and its equal applicability to the
                    nation or the city, the State or the neighborhood. But since we are a class in a
                    city, we center our attention upon the idea of the city community, using the
                    class, the school, the family and the neighborhood frequently by way of
                    illustration, and broadening our view to include the State and the nation as we
                    proceed—thus passing from the near to the distant, from the familiar
                    to the unfamiliar.
            One of the first lessons that we wish to learn is that the land is not merely a
                    place where the community life goes on, but that it is a factor that enters
                    vitally into the life of the community; that it in a measure determines the
                    nature and course of the community life; that, as the community develops, the
                    land becomes transformed; and that one of the functions of government is to aid
                    the people to get proper control of the land. The extent of the present control
                    of environment, and the extent to which it enters into our present life, is made
                    more emphatic by contrast with the conditions of pioneer life; and so we send
                    the children to Pioneer 
                            Indianapolis
                        
               , where they read  such
                    passages as this: "Yet with all these natural advantages, a corn crop
                    was secured by a fighting chance only. There were other creatures interested.
                    Wild turkeys scratched for it; woodpeckers took the sprouting plants; raccoons
                    ate it on the ear; but the worst enemies were the squirrels." Or,
                    again: "One reason for locating at this point was that it was nearer
                    the center of the State than either of the other points [under consideration]
                    Another was that this point furnished the best location for boat landing.
                    …; and, as a further reason, Fall creek was on the east side [of the
                    river] and was the stream upon which the mills were to be built, and the town
                    and mills should be on the same side of the river." And, once more, in
                    an advertisement of the first sale of lots in the new capital site: "It
                    is situated on a high, dry, uninterrupted plain of several miles'
                    extent, perfectly free from inundation, marshes and ponds. The site of the town
                    and the surrounding country is in an eminent degree beautiful and fertile, and
                    is probably the best body of land in the State. The plan of the ton-n is
                    calculated to insure the health, comfort and convenience of its inhabitants.
                    … Good wholesome water may be had at the depth of twenty feet in any
                    part of it in a sandy stratum."
            The second factor in community life—the group of people—is
                    taken up in a similar way for a preliminary study. In the course of our study we
                    shall have to deal with the great group of people which constitutes the American
                    nation, the group that makes up the population of the State of Indiana, and that
                    of the city of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . We shall hare to consider the diverse elements that compose these
                    groups, the process of transforming them into homogeneous communities, the
                    influence of the various foreign elements, and the process of making citizens of
                    them. But we begin with our own local community in its beginnings and try to
                    understand the gathering together of diverse elements here, and the
                    characteristics of the group resulting. We read, in Pioneer 
                            Indianapolis
                        
               , that the people came mostly in family groups, and that
                    they came from widely separated parts of the Union, bringing with them varying
                    characteristics. Thus: "Christopher Ladd moved all the way from 
                        South Carolina
                     on a sled." "Mrs. Nancy Forsythe traveled from 
                        Kentucky
                     on  horseback, carrying a baby
                    on her lap, who in turn carried the family cat." In 1821 Andrew Pierce
                    walked to "the New Purchase from 
                        Pittsburgh
                    ." "In May, 1821, Col. Alexander W. Russell
                    brought in a keel-boat with provisions from 
                  Frankfort, Ky.
                He descended the Kentucky and
                        Ohio Rivers without trouble. The 
                        Wabash
                     and White Rivers he ascended by what is called
                    cordelling. …It took him six weeks to ascend these two
                    rivers." In this connection the children gain an idea of early
                    transportation; but this is developed more at length in a later connection.
            It is then observed that the group of people who occupy the land together are
                    engaged in a great variety of activities for the purpose of satisfying the
                    different kinds of wants that all have in common. I wish I could take the time
                    to make clear by illustration how this subject is brought before the children;
                    but it must suffice to say that the purpose, at this stage of the course, is to
                    get vividiy before the pupils the motives of community life.
                    They learn that there is a certain set of activities for the preservation of
                    life and health; another set to satisfy the desire to own things (that men call
                    wealth); another set to gratify the intellectual wants; and still other sets of
                    activities to fulfill the desires for beauty, for right living (religion), and
                    for sociability. The pupil learns not only that all activities of the community
                    are traceable to these motives, but that all the institutions
                    of community life, such as schools, banks, churches, railroads, streets, and
                    government itself, have developed in order that these wants may be provided for.
            The story of the pioneer community shows most interestingly the presence of all
                    these interests, and it shows how they were the stimuli for the development of
                    the various phases of the early community life; but it shows also how, under the
                    hard conditions of pioneer life, isolated from civilization as it was, the
                    several interests received only partial satisfaction. To watch the unfolding of
                    the community from this standpoint is fascinating, and gives a conception of the
                    nature of the community relations that can hardly be acquired in any other way.
            In the story of pioneer life interest naturally centers in the family. This is
                    because the life of the pioneer community is  largely a family life. Abundance of material is available, as will be seen
                    farther on, to illustrate the important fact that the chief agency for providing
                    for the wants of the individual in the beginnings of community life is the
                    family. Health was looked after, industrial pursuits were carried on, education
                    was provided, the esthetic, religious and social interests were satisfied,
                    almost wholly by the family group. Even government itself was at first largely a
                    matter of family life. And then it is easy to trace how, as the community grows,
                    other special arrangements are developed to provide for the interests of the
                    people with greater efficiency than the family could do alone. But the ultimate
                    lesson to be emphasized is that, even under the complex conditions of modern
                    life, the family remains one of the most powerful forces for good or evil in the
                    community life The family has been called "the school of all the
                    virtues" that go to make good citizenship. "No matter how good
                    the doctors" nor how efficient the board of health, "the
                    health of the people in any community depends more on the family than on
                    anything else. No matter how efficient the schools, a great responsibility rests
                    on the family for the proper education of the children. No matter how many
                    social organizations there may be in the community, the social life of the home
                    is the most important of all and the most far-reaching in its results. No matter
                    how excellent the government of a community may be, it can have little good
                    result if proper government in the home is lacking."
            Let us now suppose that we have passed the preliminary consideration of the
                    elements of community life, such as have been suggested in this inadequate way.
                    We have observed the importance of the land as a factor in community life. We
                    have made a preliminary examination of the group of people—its
                    composition, its origin, its growth, etc. We have looked into the motives of
                    community life, and have gained a preliminary conception of how community life
                    has been developed for the purpose of satisfying human wants. We have given
                    considerable attention to the family as a little community which has important
                    civic functions; and we have made clear the need for government, and its
                    relation to the community life.
            And now the next idea that we wish to make plain is, that in  order to assure the successful development of the
                    community there must be permanent and definite relations established between the
                    people and the land. This idea has already been suggested when we were studying
                    the site of the community; but now we wish to develop it more systematically,
                    and to introduce particularly the governmental functions in this respect. The
                    topic includes, among other things, what the formal text-books call the
                    "territorial functions" of government.
            We may turn at once to local history as a means of approach to the subject. Mre
                    may notice, first, the unsettled life of the Indians in our locality at the time
                    of settlement. Their relations to the land they occupied were unsettled and
                    indefinite, and so long as this was the case, the life of the Indian must of
                    necessity be uncivilized. Every step that was taken by uncivilized man to
                    establish more definite and permanent relations with the soil was a step in the
                    direction of civilization.
            Then, the children may read of the purchase of the land from the Indians by the
                    national government (Pioneer 
                            Indianapolis
                        
               , p. 6): "In 1818 our national government bought
                    of the Indians the entire White river valley. The treaty,
                    called the Treaty of St. Mary's, was made in 
                        Ohio
                     at the head waters of White river. By its
                    terms the Delawares would in three years again be forced to surrender their
                    lands and become pilgrims. It is said that when the treaty was signed several of
                    the chiefs wept. The government paid the Indians for their lands in annual
                    payments. William Conner was the agent. He was strictly honest with
                    them." A little color is put into the account by a description of the
                    way the payments were made: "The Indians grouped themselves in families
                    and the family groups sat in a circle on the prairie which surrounded Mr.
                    Comer's home. The men were to be paid in dollars, the women in
                    half-dollars, and the children in quarters. First all were given as many little
                    sticks as they were to receive coins. As Mr. Conner passed around the circle
                    handing out the coins the sticks were returned to him. When the sticks were gone
                    the Indians knew that they had received all that was coming to them."
            But the value of this episode is to help in explaining how our nation has
                    acquired its territory by purchase and by conquest.  Notice that it is the national
                    government that made the purchase, and that the land became public
                        domain to be controlled and organized by the national government.
            After the acquisition of the territory, however, the work of actual settlement
                    was carried on chiefly by family groups who, by establishing homes and beginning
                    the exploitation of the natural resources, not only benefited themselves, but
                    performed a service to the entire nation by fixing definite relations with the
                    land. lye read (p. 8): "They had no legal right as yet to the land, but
                    it was generally understood that if a man built a cabin and blazed the trees
                    around his land he would be permitted to enter the land in 1821, when the time
                    of Indian occupation would expire. … Within a year settlers'
                    cabins had risen on choicest sites over the whole valley."
                    "The whole of central Indiana was then owned by the general government,
                    unsurveyed, mostly unoccupied" (p. 16).
            Incidents such as these are used, not only to illustrate the service of the
                    family in establishing relations with the land, but also to show how the
                    national government, in order to assure the families of their rights to the
                    land, and also to secure the development of the public land, enacted various
                    land laws, culminating in the Homestead Act. It also introduces the subject of
                    the congressional survey which was undertaken for the same purposes; of course
                    in this connection the method of the survey is explained, and maps of our own
                    locality, showing the lines established, examined.
            The function of the national government in organizing the public domain into
                    territories for governmental purposes, the fixing of territorial and State
                    boundaries, can be clearly shown by the history of the Northwest Territory, of
                    its division into smaller territories, and of the final admission of these
                    territories as States.
            Indiana was admitted to the Union in 1816. The State needed land for its own uses
                    as a seat of government. And so we read (p. 21): "When the Treaty of
                    St. Mary's was made in 1818, the government gave to the State four
                    square miles of the land of the Kew Purchase for the capital city, the location
                    to be selected by the State. The State legislature chose ten commissioners  and instructed them to select a site as
                    near the center of the State as possible." General Tipton was a member
                    of this commission, and we have his journal, a part of which is quoted in Pioneer Indiairapolis, giving the details of the search for a
                    suitable site.
            The capital site having been chosen, it must be surveyed and divided into lots
                    for homes, for business purposes, and for public buildings. This was done by the
                    State government. "Mr. Alexander Ralston was appointed as one of the
                    surveyors. He had assisted in laying off the city of 
                        Washington
                    . Very much of the 
                        Washington
                     plan entered into the plan for the capital of Indiana. The four
                    square miles that had been given by the government for the city was deemed
                    altogether too large; the plan as made included but one square mile. The rest of
                    the land was known as "out lots," and was fenced in for
                    pasture. The early settlers called the square mile the
                    "Corporation" and the four square miles the
                    "Donation" (p. 26). In connection with this account the pupils
                    examine maps of the original survey. One of the early settlers said: "I
                    remember well the surveyors showing the diagram of the town to my father. I
                    remember how the talented old Scotchman dilated upon the future of the capital
                    in the woods. He remarked that should ever half of the survey! A improved, what
                    a beautiful town it would make."
            I can not refrain from reading the following statement about Mr. Ralston from the
                    pages of Pioneer 
                            Indianapolis
                        
               , not only because it illustrates how important the work of
                    surveying the land was considered by the people of the community, but because it
                    also illustrates how local color is added to the work we are doing, how we
                    endeavor to make the children acquainted with the builders of our own community,
                    and how we emphasize the value of community service by means of local
                    biographical sketches: "Most of the pioneers have felt that we have not
                    yet paid our debt to Alexander Ralston. Mr. Ralston lived and died in this city;
                    he was buried in the old cemetery. Mr. Samuel Merrill, in 1827, edited The Journal. He urged the people at that time to remember that
                    Mr. Ralston in the beginning had asked for the reservation of land for a
                    spacious park." Another old settler writes: "I was four years
                    of age; I often saw Mr. Ralston.  I remember
                    him as a venerable and refined looking man, with fine silky gray hair that
                    flowed in profusion over his shoulders. …An incident told me by my
                    mother attests his benevolent disposition. In the winter of 1821-'22
                    the cold was exceedingly severe. … All the streams were frozen solid,
                    so that the cows and other beasts could not obtain water. Each morning during
                    this severe weather Mr. Ralston would be seen at his well drawing water for his
                    neighbors' cattle. This being done he would go into his house and
                    obtain a supply of corn and bread, which he would scatter to the birds that came
                    by hundreds around his dwelling."
            The land having been surveyed, preparation was made for the sale of lots. The
                    sale was advertised in the Initialize Sentinel., published at 
                        Vincennes
                    .
            "At last the ninth day of October came. It was a bleak, desolate day.
                    The one-horse wagon of Mr. James Blake was backed up against the window of the
                    cabin to be used as an office. Old Tommy Carter soon mounted the wagon as
                    auctioneer. … James M. Ray was clerk of the sale. … The
                    sale continued one week. There was not the least disturbance of any kind. Their
                    money was almost entirely gold and silver, and was left in leather bags wherever
                    they could procure shelter, and was considered as safe as it would be now in the
                    vaults of our banks. … The highest price paid for a lot was five
                    hundred dollars. … This was an uptown lot … and was the
                    choice lot because opposite the proposed site for the court-house. The average
                    price paid for lots was one hundred thirteen dollars. The ‘out
                    lots,’ now the residence portion of the city, with many business
                    centers, sold for ten, twenty and thirty dollars. … The constant
                    arrival of people, the laying out of the town, and the sale of lots, brought new
                    life, and the people went to work with fresh courage to turn the wilderness into
                    a place for comfortable living."
            Another set of relations between the people and the land is established for
                    political purposes. Thus: "The settled parts of the State were
                    organized into counties, as in other States, chiefly for judicial purposes.
                    Previous to 1821 the New Purchase was all a part of one enormous county, 
                        Delaware county
                    , with the  county seat at 
                        Connersville
                    , sixty miles from 
                        Indianapolis
                    . To this distant place the citizens of 
                        Indianapolis
                     went if for any reason they had to appear before the court. In 1821
                    the citizens of the settlement held a public meeting in Hawkins's
                    Tavern to consider the matter of organizing a county. Two citizens were
                    appointed to attend the legislature at 
                        Corydon
                     and petition for the organization. On December 31 the act was
                    passed, and the erection of a court-house provided for in the court-house
                    square. … At first Johnson, Hamilton, and a large part of 
                        Boone
                    , 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Hancock
                     counties, were attached to 
                        Marion county
                     for judicial purposes. …
            "The county commissioners proceeded to divide the county into thirteen
                    townships, four of which afterward went into other counties. Magistrates were
                    elected for each of the townships, and constables were appointed. The
                    commissioners also authorized the building of roads, etc.
            "Down to 1832 the little community of 
                        Indianapolis
                     had no separate organization for local government apart from the
                    county and State governments. … But in September of 1832 a public
                    meeting was held in the court-house to consider the incorporation of the town
                    under an act of the legislature. The incorporation took place. Five trustees
                    were elected, and five wards created, as follows" [boundaries given].
                        (Pioneer 
                            Indianapolis
                        
               , pp. 64–66.)
            But the government has done a great deal more to establish permanent and definite
                    relations between the people and the land besides making land laws, surveying
                    the public lands, and organizing territorial divisions for political purposes.
                    It has aided the people to get control of the natural resources; it has drained
                    swamps and preserved forests; it has protected against floods by the building of
                    levees; it has built roads; it has set aside land for parks, schools and public
                    buildings; it has granted franchises to corporations for the use of public
                    property; it controls the use of private property for the public good; it has
                    exercised the right of eminent domain. These are tremendously important
                    functions of government, and are sometimes exercised by the national, sometimes
                    by the State, and sometimes  by the various
                    forms of local government. More or less important illustrations of all these
                    points may be drawn from the local history of our own community.
            From this point in our course the method of procedure is to take up the several
                    interests with which the pupils are now familiar, and to show how community life
                    takes these interests into account, how the organization of the community is
                    planned with reference to them, and how government is related to these interests
                    of the individual and of the community as a whole. I can only give a partial
                    idea of the development of this part of the course.
            1. Physical Interests. The aim under this topic is to make a lasting impression
                    on the child regarding the importance of public health, the peculiar necessity
                    for watchfulness against dangers to health under the conditions of modern life,
                    especially in cities; the dependence of the individual upon others for his
                    physical welfare; the responsibility of each individual for the public health;
                    and the mechanism of the community, including government, that has been
                    developed for the protection of the public health. This is a rich field and one
                    that easily interests the children. But the magnitude of the work done by the
                    community with reference to health is made much more impressive by showing the
                    origin and development both of the peculiar dangers of modern life and of the
                    means of protection. The importance of the subject from the community standpoint
                    may be introduced by the following: "In the summer [of 1822] the work
                    of surveying … was interrupted by the visitation of a strange
                    sickness that brought great suffering and almost starvation to the settlers.
                    There was an epidemic, and very few escaped. Often there were not enough that
                    were well to care for those that were sick, and many were entirely without
                    provisions. Those that had, shared with those that had not; and they cared for
                    one another with a devotion that bound them together as one family. [Note
                    unorganized, unspecialized cooperation.]
            "The sickness was not confined to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but extended to all parts of the forest region. In 
                        Indianapolis
                     alone there  were seventy-two
                    deaths (one-eighth of the population). … Each year the sickness
                    returned during the month of July or August, but never again in such a fatal
                    form. When the frosts of October came it would cease. It was called at first the
                    autumnal sickness, and was dreaded as a pestilence. In two months of every
                    summer little labor could be performed. From twenty to forty years, according to
                    location, it continued and defied the skill of the physicians. The popular name
                    for it in later years was "chills and fever" or
                    "fever and ague." … It is well that we should know
                    the great sacrifice of the pioneers and the bitter cost to them of the healthful
                    conditions that we enjoy here to-day.
            "The growth of the town was interrupted and its reputation suffered.
                    Many people came, but as many others passed through to the prairie settlements.
                    David Turpie says the cause of the sickness was the turning up of too much fresh
                    and fever-laden soil. Mr. Holloway gives this explanation of the sickness:
                    ‘The dense forests sheltered the soil from the sun, and, compelling
                    it to retain its moisture, the broad and swampy bottoms, the marshes and the
                    frequent freshets made this the very home of chills and fever.’ It
                    was not known in those days that malaria is carried from marshes and pools of
                    water by mosquitoes. The soil was everywhere wet; there was much decay of leaves
                    in the forest, and too little opportunity for the sun to do its work of
                    evaporation and germ-killing. The gradual clearing of the wet lands, and the use
                    of drainage tiles in later years, proved the remedy, and now a case of fever and
                    ague is almost unknown."
            "The people, many of them, were too poor to pay the doctors. They (the
                    doctors) would wear themselves out in pulling through the almost impassable
                    roads … and all for the charge of fifty cents and the price of
                    medicines." (Pioneer 
                            Indianapolis
                        
               , PP. 30 ff.)
            "Our town, like all newly settled places, requires seasoning before a
                    person can be strictly healthy."
            Later we read that in 1832 the town was incorporated, and in 1836 and 1838 new
                    incorporation acts were passed. With the 
                    development of government we read of the establishment of underdrainage, and of
                    other organized measures for the protection of health, accompanied by a
                    cessation of the "autumnal fevers."
            I have referred to the history of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     water supply that is now in preparation. This naturally includes a
                    discussion of certain phases of sanitary history, and will be of great use in
                    connection with the study of public health. On the basis of this historical
                    preparation, the pupils take great interest in the observation and analysis of
                    present health conditions and the means of health protection. In order to
                    indicate the possible effectiveness of the work done, I may say that last winter
                    the discussion of this topic of public health in the eighth grade classrooms led
                    directly to a movement, participated in by the civic organizations of our city,
                    and with the active cooperation of the proper government officials and the
                    street railway company, that resulted in a thorough cleaning up of the
                    street-cars and the sidewalks.
            2. Economic Interests. Only this morning I read, in a review of Lincoln
                    Steffens' book, "The Struggle for Self-Government":
                    "If it is true, as is so stoutly contended, that morals in commerce and
                    industry are low, this condition is certain to affect politics, because of the
                    intimate relations of government to business. Permanently higher standards in
                    public life must obviously be accompanied with higher standards in business
                    life." It is a legitimate function of civics in the public schools,
                    indeed a most important function, to cultivate in our pupils a proper conception
                    of the civic aspects of business life. Again it is impossible at this time to
                    enter into the method of doing this; but it may be said that it is not to be
                    accomplished by mere moral precept, but rather by making the community relations
                    of business life a living thing in the minds of the pupils. The modern structure
                    of the business world is complex, and its relations to government difficult to
                    understand. But the fundamental principles of industrial organization, and its
                    relations to the life of the community, together with the function and machinery
                    of government for regulating it, may be clarified to a  large extent by a judicious use of illustrations
                    from local history. For example, the following quotations from Pioneer 
                            Indianapolis
                        
               :
            "The men were most of them poor, very few having money enough to enter a
                    section of land at once; yet they did not come so much to acquire wealth as to
                    establish homes" (p. 8).
            "In November, 1821, William McLaughlin and family encamped on a quarter
                    section three miles southeast of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . 14-hen they arrived they had just four dollars in cash left to
                    support a large family. … Mrs. McLaughlin sent her most valuable
                    coverlet to help pay for the corn." "Like the settlers of 
                        Plymouth
                     these western Pilgrims were sustained during their first months of
                    hardship by the Indian corn. One pioneer goes so far as to say that he does not
                    see how Indiana could have been settled at the time it was but for the
                    corn." "The pioneers represented the trades and professions,
                    yet all were farmers here in the beginning and the first crop was corn"
                    (p. 10).
            "Give the pioneer farmer an axe and an auger, or in lieu of the last a
                    burning iron, and he could make almost any machine he was wont to work with.
                    With his sharp axe he could not only cut the logs for his cabin and notch them
                    down, but he could make a close-fitting door and supply it with wooden hinges
                    and a neat latch. From the roots of an oak or ash he could fashion his homes and
                    sled-runners, make an axle-tree for his 11-agon, make a rake, a flax-brake, a
                    barrow, a scythesnath, a grain cradle, a pitchfork, a loom, a reel, a washboard,
                    a stool, a chair, a table, a bedstead, a dresser and a cradle in which to rock
                    the baby. If he was more than ordinarily clever he repaired his own cooperage,
                    and adding a drawing knife to his kit of tools, he even went so far as to make
                    his own casks, tubs and buckets. He made and mended his own shoes" (p.
                    11).
            "There being no mills to grind the corn into meal, the settlers
                    substituted what was known as lye hominy, and a kind of meal made by pounding
                    the corn in what were called mortars. … Mr. Bush, who was a
                    Vermonter, and who had brought with him quite a variety of tools, procured from
                        White river some stones, out of which he made two small
                    millstones, and then prepared the necessary woodwork for putting the same in
                    running  condition, and fastened the mill up
                    to a hackberry tree on the west bank of the river, the motive power being a long
                    beam operated by horse-power, a raw-hide rope being used for belting.
                    … No toll was charged at this mill. All that was required was that
                    each person should furnish his own horse. This was the first mill built in
                    ‘The Kew Purchase’" (p. 17–18).
            "They bought as little as possible from Whitewater, for the distance
                    made prices high. A single yard of coarse cotton cloth cost forty cents, and a
                    bushel of salt, two and one-half dollars. Money was very scarce, and what they
                    had, except the big copper cents, was Spanish or Mexican money. One settler who
                    lived some distance out from the village said that he worked all day cutting
                    down trees, and all night hunting raccoons, for raccoon skins alone brought
                    money. Most of the business was carried on by trade or barter" (p. 32).
            "Coopers and tanners, cabinet-makers and blacksmiths belonged to every
                    town. Industries were widely distributed. Cotton and woolen mills taxed the
                    power of every running stream, and the jolly miller was omnipresent to
                    accommodate any one who had grist to grind. … The village merchant
                    furnished the dry goods and groceries. The countryman found ready market for his
                    stuff. The village shoemaker was Sir Oracle to those who visited for cobbling or
                    to be measured for a new pair of shoes. In those days food was home grown. Beef
                    and bacon were home cured and clothing home spun. The honest blue-jeans which
                    most of us wore came from the skilful indigo dye of good Mrs. Crow, who also
                    spun the wool from the rolls carded by John Manly, which was afterward sent to
                    be transformed into cloth by Billy Smith, the weaver" (p. 33).
            "The Gasette, in February, 1822, said that improvement
                    had been going on. Forty residences and several workshops had been built, a
                    gristmill and two sawmills it-ere in operation, and more were in progress. There
                    were thirteen carpenters, four cabinet-makers, eight blacksmiths, four
                    shoemakers, two tailors, one hatter, two tanners, one saddler, one cooper, four
                    bricklayers, two merchants, three grocers, four doctors, three lawyers, one
                    preacher, one teacher and seven tavern keepers" (p. 41).
            
            These quotations, selected from many, give an idea of the beginnings of economic
                    life, the division of labor, cooperation, etc. The subject of transportation and
                    communication is closely related to the economic life of the community. The
                    following quotations suggest its importance:
            "In nothing else," says Judge Banta, "is there a more
                    marked change than in the condition of the roads. The old jest of the
                    stage-coach passenger walking and carrying a fence-rail to pry the vehicle out
                    of the mud-holes, had its foundation in fact" (p. 9). "In the
                    village gradual improvement was taking place. The old forest trails were being
                    changed into roads, very muddy, to be sure, and full of stumps, but they made a
                    beginning" (p. 36). "The streets, little used, were filled
                    with brush. … The first roads to the outskirts were county roads.
                    … The legislature appropriated one hundred thousand dollars for roads
                    in 1822" (p. 41). We also read of the attempt to prove the
                        White river navigable, and of the act of legislature
                    declaring nearly every stream in Indiana navigable; and finally, "The
                    modern period of our community's growth may be said to have begun in
                    1847. In that year the first railway reached the community, connecting it with
                    the outside world, and introducing it to the spirit of modern life. In that
                    year, also, 
                        Indianapolis
                     entered the city stage of government" (p. 66).
            In this same connection the following extract has an interest: "One very
                    constant source of trouble in the settlement was the lack of postal facilities. 
                        Connersville
                     for two years had to be depended on for communication with the
                    outside world; it was the nearest post-office, and sixty miles away. During the
                    season of muddy roads, which. was nine months in the year, it took three or four
                    days to get through. … At first (letters) reached the settlers here
                    in a very roundabout way, being brought by any one who lived on the road, and
                    passed along from cabin to cabin, but a meeting of citizens, held in
                    Hawkins's Tavern, resulted in their employing a private carrier.
                    … He came galloping into the village usually at nightfall, the sound
                    of his horn beginning to echo through the woods as soon as he reached
                    Pogue's run, and all the people 
                    would rush out to meet him and hear the news. … In 1822 President
                    Monroe gave the town a post-master. … The mails were carried on
                    horseback until the days of the stagecoach" (p. 39).
            The functions of our governments in protecting property, in regulating commerce
                    and industry, in the building of roads, in establishing and regulating means of
                    communication, are developed in the light of such facts as the preceding.
            3. The intellectual interests of the early community and their satisfaction can
                    be illustrated by many extracts. The following will suffice:
            "In that most interesting book on pioneer days, 'Sketches of My
                    Own Times,' Mr. Turpie gives a pretty picture of his lesson days. Mr.
                    Turpie did not live in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but pioneer life was about the same all over The New Purchase:
            "‘There was but one schoolhouse in the settlement; it was
                    used only in winter; it was four or five miles from our place. The weather was
                    cold and the way too long. Children were taught the rudiments of learning at
                    home. Thursday and Saturday were lesson days in the afternoon. My mother sat at
                    the end of the table; we at the sides. \Ire learned to read, to write, and to
                    cipher as far as long division. The pens were made of goose or turkey quills,
                    the ink from walnut hulls; it was dark brown, had a good flow, and our work was
                    quite legible.
            "Those of us who were old enough, read in turn from some book in my
                    father's collection. He had about thirty books —a large
                    library for the time and place. Among these were Pilgrim's Progress, A
                    History of the 
                        United States
                    , Greens's Life of 
                        Washington
                    , The Life of 
                        Marion
                    , Hume's English History, Cowper's Poems, and
                    Robinson Crusoe. The exercise lasted about three hours. My mother was an
                    excellent teacher; we all made fair progress, anxious to please her. On Sunday
                    we read from the Bible in the same manner, either the Old or New Testament. She
                    accompanied the reading with explanations, plain and simple, and afterwards
                    asked questions to test our memory. Sometimes the children from a
                    neighbor's house  would join us in
                    these Scripture readings and we would return their visit.’
            "About where 
                        Kentucky
                     avenue enters 
                        Illinois
                     street, and near a pond, a log schoolhouse was built during the
                    first year. It was used for church services on Sunday, and also as an assembly
                    room. Mr. Reed taught the first quarter. The next year arrangements were made
                    for a permanent school. Mr. Calvin Fletcher was chosen as one of the first
                    trustees. This description of a similar schoolhouse will give an idea of the
                    schoolroom of pioneer days in The New Purchase. ‘It was of round
                    logs, about twenty feet square, with a fireplace in one end eight feet wide. The
                    outside was a bank of dirt surrounded by logs. On an appointed day the neighbors
                    all assembled to transform it into a schoolhouse. One log was cut out of the
                    side for light, little sticks were fastened across at intervals, and then
                    greased paper fastened on instead of glass. A door was cut in one end, then the
                    splinters were shaved from a puncheon, large wooden pins were fastened in the
                    wall, and the puncheon laid on them and fastened down for a writing desk. The
                    seats were made of saplings about eight inches in diameter, split, and wooden
                    legs fastened in. On the morning that school opened the parents came with their
                    children from all directions, cutting paths and blazing trees as guides for the
                    children, some of them having as far as three miles to come to
                    school.’
            "There were no blackboards, nor was there light enough to see the
                    writing had there been any. It was very fortunate for the health of the children
                    that the school term lasted only about twelve weeks. Sometimes they had good
                    teachers, sometimes poor ones, and occasionally they could get none at all.
            "They learned a little in the schoolroom, but these pioneer children
                    received most of their education in the great out-of-door school, at work with
                    their parents, or playing with their companions in forest and by stream. They
                    grew strong and straight and tall like the Indians; and, like them, their eyes
                    were quick to see, their ears eager to listen, and their hands ready to do.
                    There was plenty of arithmetic, manual training, and physical culture for the
                    boys in the work they did with their 
                    fathers, building and plastering cabins, making furniture, rolling and hauling
                    logs, chopping wood, deadening and cutting down tsees, splitting sails, making
                    fences and roads, plowing the fields, weighing and curing the meats, tanning the
                    leather, measuring the corn, planning a wagon, carving horn, and whittling toys.
            "The girls learned as much with their mothers in helping to do the
                    spinning, weaving, sewing, knitting and cooking; in dipping the candles,
                    braiding the mats and hats, picking the geese, sfinning the feathers and furs,
                    caring for the garden, hunting the eggs, feeding the chickens, calves, and young
                    lambs, making the butter and cheese, cutting and sewing the rags for the carpet,
                    gathering the herbs, and picking the berries. You see the parents were the
                    teachers and the children were educated through work. In washing and shearing
                    the sheep, driving and milking the cows, planting and harvesting the crops, in
                    climbing the trees for nuts and fruits, in feeding the stock, trapping the game,
                    catching the fish, gathering the honey, making the sugar and picking the apples,
                    in studying the sky for the weather, in searching the river banks for relics and
                    shells, and in driving the cows through the wooded paths, they gained so much
                    knowledge about soils and stones, plants and trees, birds and animals, and moon
                    and stars, that they have been teaching us ever since through books they
                    wrote." (Pioneer Indianaplis, pp. 44–48.)
            In the light of these facts our present educational system derives new
                    significance, and we have a new point of view from which to approach the subject
                    of the civic value of education, and the work of local, State and national
                    government for the education of the people.
            4. Esthetic Interests. We are still too busy in America, apparently, to give much
                    systematic attention to civic beauty. And yet this is one phase of community
                    life that is extremely important and, fortunately, is receiving more and more
                    attention in our cities as time goes on. It is one of the interests that need
                    cultivation. It is not surprising to find that in the hard conditions of pioneer
                    life little positive attention seems to be given to the subject, and government
                    is seldom recorded as having  done anything
                    for the esthetic interests of the people until comparatively recently.
                    Nevertheless, we find the esthetic interests present even in the early days.
                    Thus, we read that "every cabin had a garden which sun and soil gave
                    over to luxuriance. The rivermen had brought from the south the seeds of a
                    strange plant—the love-apple, or tomato, and it was grown in these
                    gardens as a curiosity, and used for decoration; it was never eaten."
            5 and 6. Religious and Social Interests. I shall not take time to dwell upon
                    these, nor to read extracts from Pioneer 
                            Indianapolis
                        
                to show how prominent these interests were in the early
                    days. Illustrations could be found in great abundance.
            Having now carried the pupil through a course of training in the fundamental
                    principles of community life in its varied phases, and having led him to see how
                    the citizen is brought in contact with government in every phase of this life,
                    and how government—local, State and national—operates to
                    the erid of securing fullness of life on the part of every citizen, our course
                    in civics concludes with a discussion of how the people govern themselves, of
                    successes and failures of our system of self-government, and of a more or less
                    detailed, though elementary, analysis of the governmental
                    machinery—local, State and national.
            In this connection, again, local as well as general history assists us greatly to
                    an understanding of the nature and organization of government, and of the
                    reasons underlying our American system of division of powers. We are now
                    planning the preparation of some special brochures to assist us on this side of
                    our work. For example, we hope to have in a short time, a complete but simple
                    history of the development of the 
                        Indianapolis city
                     government.
            In concluding my paper, allow me to say that I greatly fear that I may have left
                    some false impressions with you. My own personal interest is primarily in the
                    problem of civics in the public schools, rather than in local history as an end
                    in itself. I wish, therefore, that I might have left with you a more coherent
                    and complete notion of the plan of civics work that I am especially  interested in. On the contrary, I have not only
                    failed to do this, but I have run the risk of giving you a positively erroneous
                    impression of what we are doing in this line. As I read over this paper I feel
                    that the impression is likely to be left that the civics is a mere incident
                    woven into a substantial course in local history. This is not the case. The
                    local history is used freely, but only as illustrative material to interest the
                    child, and to make plain principles of civic life. Our classes give most of
                    their time to the observation and analysis of present conditions.
            Please bear in mind that my purpose has not been to discuss the subject of
                    civics, and that I have gone into the subject at all only because it has been
                    necessary in order to make clear my claim that in connection with civics we may
                    find a most appropriate and effective use for local history as a means to an
                    end; and that, because of its utility in this connection,
                    local history thus finds its own opportunity for a more systematic and organized treatment than it can well receive in
                    any other connection in the course of study.
         
         
         
            CYRUS WILBURN HODGIN.
            CYRUS WILBURN HODGIN was born February 12, 1842, in 
                        Randolph county
                    , Indiana. His parents were Friends who emigrated from 
                        North Carolina
                     because of the slavery system of the South. His father was an
                    Abolitionist, and would pay willingly, though a poor man, two or three prices
                    for an article, rather than buy the cheaper, equally good, but made by the labor
                    of slaves. This willingness to make personal sacrifice to maintain a principle
                    was transmitted to the son. Professor Hodgin's ancestry on his
                    father's side was English and Welsh, and on his mother's,
                    Holland Dutch and Irish. His mother taught school before her marriage, and he on
                    learning this, at the age of six or seven, determined that he would be a
                    teacher, too. This determination was never shaken, though his father offered him
                    a small farm, if he would cultivate it. A friend offered him a remunerative
                    position in a bank with the opportunity of becoming a partner, and like offers
                    were declined.
            Up to the age of fifteen years, his educational opportunities were very limited.
                    At this time, he entered Whitewater Academy, a Friends' school at 
                        Richmond
                    , taught by Hiram Hadley, a teacher of more than ordinary energy and
                    success. At nineteen, he became an assistant in this school. In the autumn of
                    1864, he entered the 
                        Illinois
                     State Normal University at 
                        Bloomington
                    , that being the nearest school of the kind. This step was taken in
                    the feeling of the need for better preparation for the responsibilities of the
                    teacher's work. Here, by teaching classes in the model school, and by
                    manual labor out of school, he paid the greater part of his expenses through the
                    three years' course of study, graduating in 1867. In the autumn of the
                    same year, he was married to a classmate, Miss E. Caroline Chandler, of 
                        Williamsport
                    , Indiana. The next two years were spent in teaching, in 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, the greater part of the time as principal of the high
                    school, The three years following, he was 
                    principal of a township graded school in 
                        Henry county
                    . In the fall of 1872, he was called to the Indiana State Normal
                    School, but recently opened at 
                        Terre Haute
                    , and there he remained nine years, at the head of the Department of
                    History and Civil Government. By his work in county institutes throughout the
                    State, he did much to popularize the work of the normal school, and to bring to
                    it earnest young men and women, for better preparation for their life work. He
                    was actively engaged in county teachers' institute work for more than
                    twenty-five years.
            In 1881, he resigned his position in the State Normal School, and, after a
                    year's rest, was elected superintendent of the city schools of 
                        Rushville
                    , Indiana. The next year, he took charge of the 
                        Richmond
                     Normal School, and continued his work here until 1987, when he
                    accepted the position of professor of history and political economy in Earlham
                    College, which position he held until the time of his death.
            Professor Hodgin was, for many years, identified with work in temperance reform,
                    writing and speaking much in its behalf. He was also actively engaged in the
                    work of promoting international peace and arbitration.
            As an author, in 1880, he published "An Outline of a Course of Study in 
                        United States
                     History;" in 1891, as a supplement to Doyle's
                    American Citizen, "Outline of Civil Government in Indiana;" in
                    1893, "Indiana and the Nation;" 1893, "A Study of the
                    American Commonwealth," joint editor with Professor Woodburn, of the
                    State University; in 1897, "Sketch of the History of Indiana,"
                    for Lossing's Encyclopedia of 
                        United States
                     History. For a number of years, he had been looking forward to the
                    writing of a history of Indiana, but this work he was not privileged to
                    complete. He has been a frequent contributor to the Indiana School
                        Journal, and some other educational papers.
            Professor Hodgin was, for a long time, identified with the work of the Indiana
                    State Teachers' Association, the Indiana State History
                    Teachers' Association, the Indiana Historical Society, the National
                    Educational Association, and the American Historical Association. He was also
                    one of the mainstays of  the 
                        Wayne county
                     Historical Society, of which he was president.
            He believed that instruction in history should not only inform the intellect of
                    the student, but that it should inspire, strengthen and purify his life. In his
                    death, the historical interests of Indiana have lost one of their best
                    counselors and guides, and the State of Indiana one of her noble citizens.

            CHARLES B. LASSELLE.
            THE death of Judge Lasselle removes from the State one who has been in many
                    respects closely connected with its history. His long life lacks but little of
                    spanning the period during which Indiana has been a State in the Union. He has
                    not only held important public positions, but has always interested himself in
                    the record of what others have done. His historical collection, which now passes
                    into the possession of the State Library by purchase from the executors of the
                    estate, and concerning which a notice appears on another page of this magazine,
                    is one of the most valuable in the State. An article written by Judge Lasselle
                    some time ago appeared in the June number of this year.
            The following account is taken from The Daily Tribune of 
                        Logansport
                    , Tuesday, September 29, and the 
                  
                            Logansport
                         Semi-Weekly Report of Wednesday, September 30:
            C. B. Lasselle, veteran attorney and probate commissioner, died at the 
                        St. Joseph
                     Hospital, Sunday evening, September 27, where he had been confined
                    as a patient for more than two years. Deceased was eighty-nine years of age, and
                    his protracted illness was due to old age. Mr. Lasselle left few relatives and
                    practically no estate, although he was at one time wealthy.
            Charles B. Lasselle was born at 
                        Vincennes
                    , October 12, 1819, and was a descendant from the old stock of
                    French pioneers who  explored and settled
                    the Wabash valley. His paternal ancestors emigrated from 
                        Paris
                    , about the year 1680, and settled in 
                        Canada
                    , where they remained for nearly a century. His father was born at
                    Kekionga (at the present site of 
                        Ft. Wayne
                    ) in 1777 and is said to have been the first white child born in the
                    State north of 
                        Vincennes
                    . His mother was the daughter of Francis Bosseron, of Revolutionary
                    fame, who was afterward of considerable prominence in the War of 1812.
            In 1833, Mr. Lasselle, with his parents, moved from 
                        Vincennes
                     to 
                        Cass county
                    , settling on the north side of the Wabash
                    river, three miles from the city, later becoming residents of the
                    town. During the spring and fall of 1833 he attended school in the old seminary,
                    then the only school north of the 
                        Wabash
                     in the State. In 1836 he attended Indiana University at 
                        Bloomington
                    , and stayed until 1839, when he began the study of law with the
                    late D. D. Pratt. In 1842 he was admitted to the bar. In 1847 he was elected
                    prosecuting attorney, Closing his term three years later, he became editor of
                    the 
                  
                            Logansport
                         Telegraph, a weekly paper. In 1862 he was elected over Mr.
                    Pratt to the State legislature and was re-elected at the end of his term. In
                    1868 he was elected State Senator and resigned twice, being re-elected each
                    time.
            In the early eighties Mr. Lasselle was elected mayor of 
                        Logansport
                    . He was appointed probate commissioner of the court, which carried
                    but a small salary, in order that the veteran lawyer might have this little
                    income. When he became infirm and unable to look after the duties of his office,
                    they were taken up by Judge John S. Lairy, and the salary of $400 a
                    year ever since his confinement in the hospital has been drawn by Judge Lairy
                    and turned over to the sisters of the hospital.

            ILLINOIS HISTORICAL SOCIETIES.
            The 
                        Illinois
                     Historical Collections, Volume III, constituting the first volume
                    of the Lincoln Series, gives a good occasion for a description of some of the
                    historical work now being done in our neighboring State. This volume, edited by
                    Dr. E. E. Sparks, now president of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     State College, sometime professor of American history in the
                    University of 
                        Chicago
                    , is one of the most timely and most generally useful publications
                    ever published by an historical organization in the middle west. It contains the
                    full text of the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, carefully edited, and in
                    addition copious illustrative material and newspaper comments taken from the
                    most important papers of the time. The series to which it belongs is being
                    published by the trustees of the State Historical Library by means of an
                    appropriation from the State.
            It is only about nine years since work of this sort was begun in a serious way in 
                        Illinois
                    . At that time the publications of the State Historical Library
                    began, and from the same time dates the organization of the State Historical
                    Society. The first volume of the 
                        Illinois
                     Historical Collections, the title under which the larger and more
                    important publications are issued, was gotten out in 1903. In addition to this
                    series the State Historical Library now publishes an annual volume of
                    Transactions of the 
                        Illinois
                     State Historical Society, periodical Bulletins of the Historical
                    Library, and Journals of the Historical Society.
            In 
                        Illinois
                     a somewhat peculiar dual organization exists. The State Historical
                    Library (which, it should be said, is entirely separate and distinct from the
                    State Library), is a creature of the State, furnished with quarters in the
                    capitol, maintained  entirely by
                    appropriations from the State Legislature, and controlled by a State board of
                    trustees. It gets out all the publications of the State Historical Society. The
                    latter is a purely voluntary organization with a membership of about seven
                    hundred, the fee being one dollar, officered by a president, three
                    vice-presidents, a secretary-treasurer, and fifteen directors, all elected by
                    the members at the annual meeting. As the government of 
                        Illinois
                     gives no State aid to private organizations of this sort, there is
                    no organic union between the Society and the Library. But the librarian, or
                    secretary-treasurer of the Library, Mrs. Jessie Palmer Weber, is also the
                    secretary-treasurer of the Society, and the Library uses a considerable part of
                    its funds in the publications of the Society, issued in the name of the Library.
            One of the most interesting features of the historical movement in 
                        Illinois
                     is the growth of local societies. One of these, the 
                        Chicago
                     Historical Society, of which the late Edward G. Mason was a
                    well-known member, is a substantial and permanent organization of long standing,
                    having a good library building and invested funds of more than three hundred
                    thousand dollars. The German-American Historical Society, also of 
                        Chicago
                    , is another active organization, publishing a quarterly devoted to
                    the work the above name indicates. A strong effort is now being made by the
                    State organization to advance the development of county societies. This has been
                    so far successful that in 1907 there were in 
                        Illinois
                     twenty county historical societies and four other organizations
                    doing the work of county historical societies. Some of these are active and well
                    established, others are intermittent in their efforts and their meetings, and
                    some are probably moribund. A slight official connection between them and the
                    State Historical Society is maintained in the provision that the presidents of
                    local historical societies shall be honorary vice-presidents of that
                    organization. We in Indiana should follow with interest this attempt to extend
                    and popularize the study of local history and the preservation of historical
                    material.
         
         
         
            NOTES.
            AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION.

                     and 
                        Richmond
                    , special exhibits of the Division of Manuscripts and the Division
                    of Maps in 
                        Washington
                    , and in the Confederate Museum at 
                        Richmond
                    , a reception by Ambassador and Mrs. Bryce and receptions by various
                    social organizations at 
                        Richmond
                    , and an excursion to the University of 
                        Virginia
                     at Char-lottesville.
            The program includes addresses by James Bryce, James Ford Rhodes, George B.
                    Adams, Charles H. Haskins, C. Raymond Beazley, O. H. Richardson, General Edward
                    P. Alexander and others, and conferences on "The Relations of Geography
                    to History," "History in Secondary Schools,"
                    "State and Local Historical Societies," "Research in
                    English History," in "American Colonial and Revolutionary
                    History," in "Southern History" and other topics of
                    importance.
            The arrangements for the meeting, the place of meeting and the program are all
                    exceptionally attractive and it is to be hoped that there will be a large
                    attendance from this State.
            THE LASSELLE COLLECTION.
            The Department of Archives and History of the Indiana State Library has recently
                    secured for the library the collection which Mr. Charles B. Lasselle, of 
                        Logansport
                    , had been collecting for over half a century. This collection of
                    historic material is perhaps the best private one in this State. It is quite
                    rich in manuscript material, a large part of which goes back to the territorial
                    period and concerns 
                        Vincennes
                    . There is also in the collection an almost complete file of 
                        Logansport
                     newspapers,  beginning with the
                        Pottawattomie Times, the first paper published in that
                    region. There are other local newspapers, a number of valuable pamphlets, and
                    many old books. There is also supposed to be practically a complete set of the
                    Acts of the Indiana State Legislature, together with several interesting
                    historical relics.
            It will be some time before the materials can be inspected and classified
                    sufficiently to give a definite idea of everything.
            It is hoped, with this collection as a nucleus, that the Indiana State Library
                    will be able to add rapidly to its collection of Indiana manuscript material.
            MEETING OF OHIO VALLEY HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIOK.
            The second annual meeting of the Ohio Valley Historical
                    Association was held at 
                  Marietta, Ohio
               , on November 27 and 28. Especial interest attached to
                    the meeting because of the historical associations of the meeting place. There
                    was a good attendance of representatives from the several States of the
                        Ohio Valley. The Friday morning session was devoted to
                    a discussion of Historical Manuscript Collections, and methods of locating and
                    indexing them. The result of this discussion was the appointment of a committee
                    to locate and index such manuscript collections.
            Friday afternoon there was a general public meeting, at which addresses were
                    given by Miss Ellen Churchill Semple, on "The Relation Between
                    Geography and History;" Dr. W. J. Holland, of Pittsburg, on
                    "Historic Beginnings of the Ohio Valley;"
                    Colonel John L. Vance, of 
                        Columbus
                    , on "The Ohio River, Its Improvement
                    and Commercial Importance;" and Vergil A. Lewis, of 
                        Charleston
                    , 
                        West Virginia
                    , on "Lord Dunmore's War." At the close
                    of this session a reception was given for the delegates in the 
                        Ohio
                     Company's Land Office, the oldest building in 
                        Ohio
                    , and containing a collection of historical relics pertaining to the
                    first settlement of 
                        Ohio
                    .
            On Friday evening a banquet was given at the Y. M. C. A. building, at which the
                    principal address was made by President S. C. Mitchell, of the University of 
                        California
                    . Dr. Mitchell made an impression on his audience for the keenness
                    of his insight into the problems of the South, and by his extreme justness in
                    handling  these problems. Professor T. C.
                    Reve, of the 
                        Cincinnati
                     Law School, was toastmaster.
            On Saturday morning Mr. Arthur W. Dunn, of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , read a paper on "The Civic Value of Local
                    History," which was discussed by former city auditor W. G. Culkins, of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and by Professor Henry R. Spencer, of 
                        Ohio
                     State University. Miss May Lowe, of 
                  Circleville, Ohio
               , was to have read a paper on "The
                    Present Status of Local History in the Schools," but in her absence an
                    abstract of her paper was presented by the secretary. The paper will appear in
                    the published proceedings.
            A business session followed, at which the election of officers was held.
                    Professor T. C. Greve, of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , was elected president; vice-presidents, W. W. Longmore, of 
                        Kentucky
                    ; Vergil Lewis, of 
                        West Virginia
                    ; A. W. Dunn, of Indiana, and Professor Elson, of 
                        Ohio
                    ; secretary and treasurer, Professor I. J. Cox, of 
                        Cincinnati
                    ; recording secretary and curator, Professor A. B. Hulbert, of
                    Marietta College. A committee was appointed to investigate and report on the
                    teaching of local history in the schools, and also one to investigate the
                    location and indexing of manuscripts.
            The Saturday afternoon session was devoted to three papers:
                    "Braddock's Road," by Henry W. Temple, of 
                        Washington
                     and Jefferson College; "Zane's Trace,"
                    by C. L. Martzollf, of 
                        Ohio
                     University; and "The Old Maysville Road," by
                    Samuel M. Wilson, of 
                  Lexington,
                            Kentucky
               . In Mr.
                    Wilson's absence, his paper was read for him by H. B. Mackoy, of
                            
                  Covington, Kentucky
               .
            The choice of a place of meeting for next year was left with the executive
                    committee. Invitations were extended by the representatives of a number of
                    cities, but the meeting will probably go to 
                  Frankfort, Kentucky
               .
         
         
            REVIEWS OF BOOKS.
            TRUE INDIAN STORIES.
            [By Jacob Piatt Dun. Illustrated. 320 pages. 1908. Sentinel Printing Company, 
                        Indianapolis
                    . $1.00.]
            Mr. Dunn's latest work upon Indiana consists of two distinct parts which
                    do not necessarily belong together, the first 252  pages being given to the narration of incidents in
                    Indiana history in which Indians figure prominently, and the last 67 pages being
                    an "Index Glossary of Indiana Indian Names." The stories
                    include a life of Little Turtle, the murder of the Indian witches, the story of
                    Tecumseh, the battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , William Wells, the defense of Fort Harrison, the Pigeon Roost
                    massacre, the service of the Indian Logan in saving 
                        Ft. Wayne
                     in 1812, the Walam Olum, the murder of the Indians at Pendleton,
                    Frances Slocum and the removal of the last of the Potawatomies. These stories
                    have appeared in the 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         News during the last year or so and have been previously
                    noticed in this magazine. They are interestingly told, and taken together give
                    not only an impressive recital of individual exploits but illustrate admirably
                    the leading traits of the Indians in their relations with the white
                    men,—cunning and bravery in battle, childlike incompetence in the
                    economic struggle for existence, blunt stoicism when face to face with suffering
                    and death. Mr. Dunn could not have taken a better way to tell this chapter of
                    our early history.
            Much interest attaches also to the list of Indian names given at different times
                    to places and rivers in Indiana. The retention of Indian names for our cities
                    and rivers might well have been carried to a greater extent than it was. The
                    restoration of such names, long displaced by English translations or
                    substitutes, has occasionally been effected in Indiana, and is, in my opinion,
                    to be heartily encotiraged wherever possible. in some instances the phonetic
                    advantage would perhaps be doubtful, as in the case of the name of 
                        Fall Creek
                     sometimes applied by the Indians to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Chanktunoongi. But almost anything would be preferable to the lack
                    of imagination shown by the recurrence of such names as 
                        Greenfield
                    , Green-brier, 
                        Greencastle
                    , 
                        Greene Center
                    , 
                        Greenhill
                    , 
                        Green Mound
                    , 
                        Greenoak
                    , 
                        Green Spring
                    , 
                        Greentown
                    , 
                        Greenville
                    , 
                        Greenwood
                     (there times repeated in Indiana), or 
                        Brown
                    , 
                        Brownsburg
                    , 
                        Brownstown
                    , Browns Valley, 
                        Brownsville
                    . One of the best sounding Indian names in the State was
                    Wah-pi-kah-me-ki which ought never to have been surrendered for its equivalent,
                        White River.
            
            The effort to get the original meaning of Indian names, however, is a different
                    matter. It is at best an antiquarian and etymological task of great difficulty
                    and of little value. In most cases the explanations given by surviving Indians
                    of this and the two or three preceding generations seem to a layman, even when
                    plausible, to be entitled to little credence. And the present form of Indian
                    names that have been preserved and whose derivation is often known, is so
                    corrupted that the Indians themselves would not recognize it. If any one among
                    us, however, is able to trace these names in their devious windings, Mr. Dunn is
                    the man, and since he has the patience to do it we would do well to take the
                    utmost advantage of his results.

            INDIANA IN THE MEXICAN WAR.
            [By Oran Perry, Adjutant-General of Indiana. Illustrated. State Printer.]
            Compilations are not usually attractive as literature. While this volume was not
                    written to please, we venture the assertion that no single piece of historical
                    work of more value has been done in the State for a long time. There is no
                    attempt to pass judgment upon the facts, but merely to collect the material. The
                    work is impartially done. Mr. Perry has gone carefully over the newspapers of
                    the period,—the Indiana Sentinel, 
                            Madison
                         Courier, State Journal, Indiana Journal and 
                  
                            New Albany
                         Democrat,—and culled incidents and narratives
                    long since forgotten. County histories, State and Federal documents, have also
                    been of great assistance to the compiler. The volume contains the portraits of
                    Governor Whitcomb, Adjutant-General David Reynolds and the colonels of the five
                    Indiana regiments which served in the war. The controversy about the retreat of
                    the second regiment is brought forward with papers and reports.
            There is nothing of greater value in this volume than the soster of the five
                    regiments and the mounted riflemen. This roster is quite complete and the best
                    ever published.
            The work is a credit to Mr. Perry and provides a most useful reference work upon
                    this portion of Indiana history.
            This valuable compilation should have a good index. The extracts, reports and
                    sketches are difficult to find without such an index. This is lacking. For
                    instance: "A tug of war" is of  no value, though a short extract has such a
                    heading. "Death of W. H. Custer," instead of "Custer,
                    W. H., Death of," is unpardonable. The index is evidently put in as a
                    mere formality, and there is no table of contents of any sort. A reviewer can
                    hardly condemn this shortcoming too strongly, as it deprives the book of half of
                    its value for use in reference work or historical study.
         
         
            RUSH COUNTY—HISTORICAL, EDUCATIOKAL AND BIOGRAPBICAL.
            [
                        Rushville
                     Publishing Co.]
            There are seven contributors to this historical atlas of 
                        Rush county
                    . The volume contains county and township maps, with town plats,
                    directories of the land owners, a history of the government of the county and of
                    the schools, some biographies and a compilation of laws. The last is quite
                    unnecessary in such a publication, even though well done.
            John L. Shank writes the history of the schools, which, by the way, include the
                    well-known Fairview Academy, a classical school of high standing conducted by
                    Allen R. Benton, who lives now at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , in 
                        Irvington
                    . The biographical list is entirely too short. It should be complete
