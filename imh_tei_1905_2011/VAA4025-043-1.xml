            <p>Little islands of French settlers, entirely surrounded by a wide sea of green forest, were to be
                    found along the rivers and lakes of Indiana Territory at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
                    Many of them had come from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, and a few from <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and La Louisiane. Among them were descendants of French men and Indian women. Grouped
                    about Catholic missions or churches, military garrisons, and fur-trading posts, they varied from the
                    faithful <hi rend="i">domine</hi> and devout Jesuit, to the soldier, the wilder <hi rend="i">coureurs de bois</hi>, the women of ill repute whom the government had mistakingly hoped would
                    be transformed by the virtues of the New World into suitable wives for the distant sons of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, and finally to the dark-skinned aborigines of the American forests. Living together in
                    small villages, the French tilled their long narrow farms which stretched back from the rivers.
                    Although primitive methods and tools were employed, they managed to raise more food than they
                    consumed. The surplus crops and the furs they obtained from the Indian trade were carried down the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and exchanged for the necessities they could not produce and such luxuries as they
                    could afford. Their houses were usually primitive and characteristically equipped with porches or
                    galleries. Within were sometimes housed some highly prized and valued furniture, dishes, and
                    clothing which had been imported from <placeName>

            <p>"Self-sufficient in their traditional isolation," the French were of a gentle and
                    indolent nature, dependent upon authority, devoted to community life, possessed of a taste for some
                    refinements, and possibly more temperate and law-abiding than many of the American frontiersmen, who
                    seemed to them as intruders upon an idyllic past. Disappointed with the passing of French control,
                    and the subsequent displacement of French law, some of the French began to emigrate to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. After 1779 "a trickle of American immigration from the southern states, east
                    and west, had replaced them and was becoming by 1800 a stream manifestly destined soon to overflow
                    and fill in the whole of the … country." Many of the French were ruined by
                    generous loans to the cause of the Revolution and by the maintenance and pillage of troops. They
                    were neglected for years by Congress, and threatened with the loss of their slaves by the Ordinance
                    of 1787. The lands which Congress promised them, in many instances, fell into the control of
                    speculators. The character of their records, or their absence, gave great opportunity for corruption
                    and deceit. They were not only confronted with a new political system under American sovereignty,
                    but were soon excluded from its offices. It is not surprising that many left the villages of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>

            <p>The presence of the French affected the character of the civilization that developed on this Middle
                    Western frontier. Their good relations with the Indians, which gave them immunity from attack, made
                    their villages a good place for the earliest Americans to settle. The confused state of their land
                    titles and their willingness to part with their claims or to make grants freely to the newcomers
                    enabled some of the frontiersmen to secure land long before the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> placed land on the Indiana market. These conditions offered the kind of opportunities
                    upon which the land jobber thrived. The ownership of slaves and the guarantee of their property
                    rights made it difficult to enforce the prohibition of slavery which the Ordinance of 1787
                    contained. "Royalist by tradition, Federalists by tendency, content with the paternalistic

                    … ‘resented the burdens and … seemed indifferent to the supposed
                    virtues of popular government.’<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Their votes and influence could,
                    however, often be controlled by political adventurers who cultivated their favor. It is not
                    surprising that Governor William H. Harrison, with his <placeName>

                    </placeName> background, and with this type of environment in which to formulate his early policies,
                    should have been regarded by some of his people as a Federalist. Eventually, the French and their
                    influences were submerged in the mass of the more energetic and more numerous frontiersmen, but
                    these early contributions to the rising way of life in Indiana Territory were significant.</p>
            <p>The village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which became the capital of the new territory, received an early American migration.
                    Apparently, the Piankashaw Indians had granted the French a considerable piece of land, which became
                    known as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Tract. From this the members of the court granted to themselves and the newcomers
                    generous portions of land. To every "adventurer" who came to live among them they
                    gave "a plantation of four hundred acres." They requested Congress to approve
                    these grants and pointed out that the amount wanted for themselves and the Americans would require
                    only a tract thirty miles square. The latter explained that they were reduced to poverty and misery
                    at the end of the long and severe Revolutionary war by their participation and contributions, by the
                    decline of trade, and the neglect of husbandry, and that they migrated to this distant country in

                    </placeName> and even among their own people, the Friends gave careful consideration to the

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and from thence they crossed the state of <placeName>

                    </placeName> route. It was the most direct, but was not the easiest. In the earlier years of the
                    migration, it was thought better for those traveling with loaded wagons to leave New River and to
                    take <placeName>

                    </placeName> and turned westward over Braddock's Road." The migration, which was
                    often undertaken for conscience sake, brought into the territory a serious and sturdy people with
                    democratic principles and a prejudice against slavery. The settlement of this area was an important
                    political development in the history of the territory.</p>

            <p>The population of Indiana Territory was approximately twenty-five thousand in 1810, when Indian
                    difficulties were soon to check migration for a short time. The trails as well as the nativities of
                    the early settlers indicate that this population came largely from south of the <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName> and practically all over trails through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and the Southern states.</p>
            <p>The experiences of this frontier population in establishing its social and political institutions
                    form an interesting and significant chapter in the development of frontier democracy. The forces
                    which handicapped the influence of the frontier in the South were absent or so weak as to be unable
                    to control the formation of government and society. Largely lacking were the numerous planters and
                    their slaves. Undemocratic state governments with their policies which favored land speculation,
                    slavery, and aristocracy were not in control. Climate and other geographic forces did not make
                    possible an agricultural regime based upon staple products such as cotton, rice, indigo, or tobacco.</p>
            <p>A few aspired to be country gentlemen in imitation of the planter class, farms were often called
                    plantations, a few colored slaves and workers were held as house servants, and land speculation
                    existed on every hand, but more often it was the activity of the small landholder rather than of the
                    rich who dealt in thousands of acres. The little coterie of able men who gathered around Harrison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> came to be called the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Aristocrats. Negro servants were held by some of them. Aristocratic manners,
                    characteristic of the plantation South or of the old country, had been carried <pb n="9" id="VAA4025-043-1-013"/> into this frontier region. General James Dill, a native of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> and a Harrison appointee, attended court as a prosecuting attorney in the costume of a
                    gentleman of the Revolutionary period, knee breeches, silver buckles, and cue, "a mild
                    protest against the leveling tendencies of the age" and of the frontier.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the character of society was not determined by these forces. The larger number of citizens were
                    small landowners and squatters. Until the land was surveyed and placed on sale, nearly all were
                    squatters. When the sales were opened, those who had the money bought small pieces of land. Since
                    the credit system held sway from 1800 to 1820, many a poor man got together enough money to make the
                    first payment and then hoped that industry and good fortune would enable him to meet the succeeding
                    payments before it was too late. The arrears of interest and principal indicate that many had been
                    too optimistic.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> But the point is that the Indiana frontier was a poor
                    man's home and its development in the formative period was shaped by frontier influences.</p>
            <p>The law which created Indiana Territory re-established the same nonrepresentative type of government
                    which existed in the first stage of the Northwest Territory.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> William Henry
                    Harrison, the governor of the new territory, had gained experience in the former where he served for
                    short periods as secretary and delegate to Congress. He avoided many of the arbitrary acts of St.
                    Clair, but his policies and appointments as governor attracted to him many of the more conservative
                    leaders and antagonized a few vigorous men and a growing number of the newer settlers.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Although the <list type="footnotes">

                    sympathy with the ways of the frontiersmen. From the beginning, however, there was much interest
                    taken in the acts of government, and neither the efforts of the people to make the government more
                    democratic nor the governor's critics were suppressed. An almost immediate and continuous
                    movement was begun to make the government not only responsive to the wishes and needs of the people,
                    but also to place it in their hands.</p>
            <p>The causes of this movement might be classified as the conditions which produced discontent and the
                    developments which gave the people the opportunity to participate in their own government. Some of
                    them were the lack of unity in a territory which included remote settlements occupied by people of
                    different origins, connections, and interests, as well as' the uncertainty of land titles, the
                    activity of land speculators, and the claims of the Indians to large parts of the territory. But the
                    desire of the people for greater self-government, the political ambitions of various individuals,
                    the efforts to legalize slavery, and the difference of opinion as to the best methods of attracting
                    settlers to the country were also involved. Perhaps this latter point has not received enough
                    attention. Persons of aristocratic tendencies placed much emphasis upon the importance of securing
                    men of wealth, family, and education. The closest source of such settlers was the planter class of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and other Southern states. The planters owned slaves, hence the efforts to legalize
                    slavery. On the other hand, the democratic masses from the South, many of whom had there suffered
                    political, social, and economic discriminations, and settlers from the North were not enthusiastic
                    about the pretensions of the aristocrats to superior talents and they were not willing to pay the
                    price of their coming,–the admission of slavery. It was the old contest of a white
                    man's society with democratic features against the planters' social order with its
                    aristocratic characteristics. Often the contest degenerated into petty quarrels in which every act
                    of the governor was attacked and defended with spirit and acrimony, but if one sees only these
                    disputes, the trees have obscured the forest.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>The territorial history of Indiana falls rather naturally into five divisions. There was the
                    unrepresentative stage of territorial government which lasted four years, the early part of the
                    second stage before the separation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Territory in 1809, the shorter term between the division of the territory and the
                    resumption of Indian warfare, the three years of warfare from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> campaign in 1811 to the end of Harrison's campaign in 1813, and finally the
                    successful struggle for statehood, 1814–1816.</p>
            <p>Before the formation of Indiana Territory, petitions for the admission of slavery in the Northwest
                    were sent to Congress from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Country. Before Harrison arrived, another petition, containing 270 names and requesting
                    a limited type of slavery, was forwarded from the same region. Petitions and letters were sent to
                    Governor Harrison early in 1801, largely from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> counties, advocating an advance to the second or semi-representative stage of
                    government. This two-fold agitation created a problem for the new governor. He apparently decided to
                    oppose the request for a change in government. He supposedly wrote a letter in opposition calling
                    attention to the increased costs which the people would have to bear. As a result this phase of the
                    agitation came to an end.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next year, 1802, the slavery phase of the movement was resumed, when the governor was requested
                    to call a convention to consider the propriety of repealing the antislavery article of the Northwest
                    Ordinance. He decided to support this phase of the agitation, professing to believe that a majority
                    of the people favored this procedure. He called an election of delegates and the convention
                    assembled at <placeName>

                    Christmas day. Three days later a petition to Congress requested the suspension on the grounds that
                    desirable settlers were forced to move west of the <placeName>

                    Indian title to the southern part of the territory, to sell the lands in small quantities and at a
                    lower price, to grant pre-emption to the squatters who were waiting the opportunity to buy the land
                    on which they were living, to hasten the settlement of the claims granted to the early settlers, and
                    to grant lands to encourage the building of roads and taverns and the establishment of educational
                    institutions. They also petitioned that the fifty-acre-freehold qualification for voters be repealed
                    and that the right of suffrage be extended to free adult male inhabitants. If it is realized that
                    the members of the convention were chiefly interested in developing the territory, their labors are
                    rational even though their support of slavery on the one hand and democracy on the other was
                    philosophically inconsistent. They sought to attract wealthy settlers by legalizing slavery, and
                    poorer settlers by the opportunity to buy land in smaller pieces and at lower prices and to have a
                    potent voice in their own government. Even the meeting of the assembly was a step in the direction
                    of self-government.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    situation in part by an official evasion of the Northwest Ordinance. In their legislative capacity

                    advisability of passing into the second or semi-representative stage of government in 1804.
                    Petitions, he stated, were presented to him asking for representative government. To ascertain the
                    wishes of a majority, he called an election on September 11, at which time the majority of those
                    voting, favored the change. The governor proclaimed the second stage and called an election of
                    representatives for the lower house of the territorial assembly.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the change represented the wishes of the majority or not, a violent newspaper controversy

                    to the unsuitability of the laws of other states for Indiana Territory, and to a lack of a voice in
                    any act of the territorial or national government. In extravagant language, the address referred to
                    the first stage of territorial government as the most abominable and tyrannical system ever
                    organized for freemen. The second stage was described as imperfect but as an improvement. It also
                    asserted that the expenses would not be too heavy, that a delegate in Congress was needed, and that

                    the freeholders wanted the change in government, while "A Citizen," probably
                    Mcintosh, denied this, and a "Plough Boy" defended the governor.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Name calling and heat were soon substituted for reasoning, the writers revealed each
                    other's identity, and Parke obviously tried to provoke Mcintosh into challenging him to a
                    duel, but the latter asked Parke if calumny was Harrison's last defense.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>For a time, however, Harrison and his supporters kept things well in hand. President Thomas Jefferson
                    requested Harrison to choose for him the five members of the upper house of the legislature and

            <p>The territorial legislature functioned with reasonable wisdom, thus denying the allegation that the
                    territory lacked the necessary men of talents. Two of the measures which seem to demonstrate the
                    good sense of its members were the substitution of a single county court for the earlier complicated
                    system, and the codification of the laws.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> More important was the gradual
                    assertion and execution of the wishes of the people in a territorial government that was only
                    partially representative.</p>

                    the haste with which the advance to the second stage was accomplished. About the same time, several
                    members of the territorial legislature petitioned the admission of slavery and the formation of a

            <p>Perhaps the question of slavery was the leading issue in dividing the people into parties, the
                    administration party being composed of the friends of Harrison and the rising popular party of his
                    opponents. Giving reality to the slavery question was the affect it would have on the type of people
                    who settled in the territory and the consequent influence on the social and political order. Not a
                    mere struggle over slavery arose, but a widespread movement to work out a popular government at the
                    level of the common citizen, a government that would prevent the development of an aristocratic
                    social and political system. It sought also to secure a land system more advantageous to the common
                    man and less conducive to speculation and large holdings. It was a broader movement than those in <placeName>

                    people took over the government even in the face of the absolute veto of the governor. Petitions
                    were forwarded to the proper authorities about a variety of subjects: the appointment of a new
                    territorial judge, popular election of members of the council, popular election of the delegate to
                    Congress, election of militia officers, extension of the suffrage, forgiveness of interest and
                    extension of time for making payments on land, extension of time for filing claims for land,
                    pre-emption, land grants, restrictions on speculators, abolition of indentured servitude,
                    reappointment and non-reappointment of Governor Harrison, and the division of the territory. Persons

            <p>The changes in the structure of the territorial government caused a long and acrimonious contest in
                    1809 which revealed a democratic spirit and procedure in advance of its time. The regular election
                    for members of the legislature was held on April 3, 1809, before official word was received of
                    division. Additional members were made necessary by division and new members and the delegate to
                    Congress were elected on May 22.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Throughout the early months of the year, the
                    partisan controversy was waged in the columns of the <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi>, through
                    handbills, and in public meetings. Even after the last election, there were charges and counter
                    charges, explanations of what had happened, and an anti-climatical campaign for and against the
                    reappointment of Governor Harrison. The election resulted in the choice of Jonathan Jennings as
                    delegate to Congress in which position he became the leader of the anti-Harrison forces. The upper
                    house of the territorial legislature was chosen for the first time by the voters. The legislative
                    results of the election and the protests of the Harrison leaders leave no doubt of the significance
                    of the results.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

                            parties have always existed, in this obscure portion of the Union, but from the trimming
                            disposition of the public officers, they have been jumbled together in chaotic confusion,
                            and perhaps would long have remained so, if a question of vast moral and political
                            importance, had not been started, and which necessarily separated the two parties, and
                            called each into action. I mean the introduction of slavery.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

                    people and the Republicans were democrats who had faith in the people. The doctor's
                    analysis seemed inaccurate to many of his contemporaries and very annoying to the aristocrats of
                    Indiana Territory, but there was a large amount of truth in what he wrote. Perhaps, too, his
                    treatment of the slavery issue was correct, that is, it was the issue which crystalized the
                    differences between the two groups and which spurred them to action. In this pre-election
                    discussion, General W. Johnston suggested that the labor of the poor would be reduced in value by
                    competition with slave labor.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> "Slim Simon" denied this and
                    asserted that the slaveowner could not undersell the farmer. He held that slaves were only dangerous
                    in a few states, that their diffusion would aid the slaves and the Southern states, and that no
                    moral question was involved.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> M'Namee asked why Indiana should admit into its

                    were rendered more happy they would multiply proportionally, that the admission of slaves into
                    Indiana would not affect the general condition, and that the only result would be to place Indiana
                    in the same perilous condition as the Southern states. He asked "How can humanity be

                    this idea, holding that its unconstitutionality would deter the slaveowners from coming to Indiana

                    immigration of those opposed to slavery. He also attacked Harrison and Judge Benjamin Parke for
                    interfering in elections, engaging in intrigues and writing scurrilous pieces over various
                    signatures for the newspapers. Much criticism was offered because Parke, the first delegate, and <placeName>

                    slavery but that Harrison's influence in the elections and among the official class was too

            <p>The controversy reached a climax in the election of the delegate to Congress. It is possible that
                    Harrison was ready to compromise before it was over. The "Detector," just before

                    admitted that the pro-slavery admissionists were beaten and ready to abandon the idea, and proposed
                    that all "unite … upon other schemes to improve our country." He
                    asserted that the opposition did not care about the slaves, but that they were interested only in

                    representatives. This legislature wrote the victory of the popular party into law. New counties were
                    formed, members of the legislature were apportioned, the date for the election of the congressional
                    delegate was set, the indenture law was repealed, and the law requiring servants of color to fulfill
                    the contracts under which they entered the territory was also repealed.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
                    Nothing is more revealing than Harrison's failure to use his absolute veto upon any of
                    these acts. No longer was his influence dominant. His friends could not browbeat a critic into
                    silence, and he was willing to give up the struggle if peace could be restored.</p>
            <p>But some of his followers and many of his opponents were unwilling to make peace. The people were
                    unwilling to give up the democratic advances and, indeed, wanted to make their government more
                    democratic. The violent storm in the press, however, ceased and something very much like a calm
                    ensued. Jennings endeavored to persuade Congress to declare ineligible for election to the

            <p>An account of a journey through the Whitewater Valley which was made almost ten years before the
                    formation of Indiana Territory has been written by Jacob Parkhurst, who visited the southern part of
                    the valley in the winter of 1790–1791 on a hunting expedition. After crossing the

                    complained of having their horses stolen by the Indians since the beginning of the recent Indian

            <p>We learn from the diary of three Moravian missionaries that by the spring of 1801 the settlers had
                    advanced further up the valley. Entering the Whitewater River' from the Great Miami, they said of
                    the inhabitants, whom they found six miles up the Whitewater: "They told us the Indians buy
                    all their cattle from them and that they are frequently about here. …" Most of

                    </placeName> to Indiana in 1804 and settled about three miles above the present site of Harrison. He
                    described that area as being "somewhat densely settled" to a point six or seven

                    </placeName>. He characterized the settlers in the following words: "The first settlers in
                    the White Water bottoms (for few settled elsewhere) were in many respects a charming people. When I
                    became acquainted with them in 1804, they were generally a sober, industrious, harmless, and
                    kind-hearted people." Wiley also stated that most of the settlers were able to make only
                    the one-fourth cash payment on their land and that many could not meet the remaining payments within
                    the allotted four years, so they had to sell and buy a tract of land farther in the wilderness.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>In spite of the presence of Indians and other hardships imposed by the wilderness, the lower and

            <p>Smith Hunt, who, with his father and three brothers, settled in the Whitewater Valley in March, 1806,
                    stated that he found an indistinct road from Clermont County, <placeName>

                    necessary to cut out a road for their teams. Hunt gives an idea of the speed with which cabins were
                    erected in those days. "On the evening of our arrival we cut a board tree–the
                    next day we cut the logs, hauled them, raised a cabin 16 by 18 feet, made the clap boards, covered
                    our cabin, and moved into it that evening." The cabin completed, they cleared five acres of
                    land and planted a crop of corn. The next achievement was to build a mill, which was ready for use
                    in August.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>The two principal reasons for the migration of the southern Friends appears to have been a desire for

                    great inducement to Friends to wish for a change of their residence, was the great sufferings of the
                    poor slaves around them." Continuing, he related the many obstacles to travel in his

                    <p>Owing to their disapproval of slavery, many of the early settlers from the Carolinas, who came

                        felt the high moral influence of the Friends, in the development of social conditions. Their

            <p>One moderating influence upon the uncouthness and bois-terousness of the frontier was the pioneer
                    church. As soon as a few of the same denomination settled in a particular place, they held some sort
                    of service and effected an organization. The Baptists were the first to organize a church in the
                    Whitewater Valley. The first meetinghouse was probably built on Lee's Creek, a branch of
                    the Dry Fork of the Whitewater, and three miles east of Harrison about 1804. The next place of
                    worship was about a mile and a half above Johnson's Fork at Jacob Hackleman's
                    house in 1805 or 1806. Not long after this, in 1806, another church was organized three miles below <placeName>

                    </placeName>, near Little Cedar Grove Creek. This was the famous Little Cedar Grove Baptist Church.

                    "Carolina Settlement" was composed of Baptists and Presbyterians, but it is not

                    quite a number of new comers [who] had landed in our neighborhood, and the small strip of territory
                    [Greenville Treaty] was nearly all taken up–cabins were built all over the woods and

                    that their surplus produce had to be hauled over an almost impassable mud road. Wheat was marketed
                    for 37 V2 cents a bushel and salt had to be purchased at three dollars a bushel. If there had been
                    taverns, the wagoners would have been too poor to put up at them, so they were forced to camp out on

            <p>There is no accurate method of determining the population of the Whitewater Valley at the close of

                    about the same percentage to the 1810 census figure, a result of 5,500 persons is obtained. It must
                    be remembered that this figure is, at best, rough, but it will provide an idea of the extent of the

                    a doubt made by young men and women. Seventy-four and four-tenths per cent of the white people were
                    twenty-five years of age or less and ninety-one and seven-tenths per cent were under forty-five.

            <p>The American frontiersmen seem to have discovered for themselves the Whitewater Valley while it still
                    belonged to the Indians. Very shortly after the Treaty of Greenville, the portion of territory
                    between the treaty line and the Miami Valley was occupied by squatters. Not until 1801 did the
                    federal government place any of the Whitewater land on sale. The year following, the eastern
                    boundary of Indiana Territory was moved eastward from the treaty line to a line drawn north from the
                    mouth of the Great Miami and Governor Harrison soon organized this new acquisition into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>
                    </placeName> . Here came, John Conner, the Indian trader, the immigrants from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> who founded the Carolina Settlement, numerous Kentuckians, and many Quakers from <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Although most of the settlers came from the South, they were largely from the
                    nonslaveholding class, .and many left that region in order to escape slavery. They formed a white
                    man's civilization, which they buttressed with schools and churches. Their economic life
                    tended to center in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> towards which their main roads led. Most of the settlers probably came after the land
                    sales; began, and most of them were young in years. Although they were not more than five or six
                    thousand in number by 1810, they did not yield to the Indian menace which their acquisition of
                    additional land helped to stimulate, but on the contrary they founded one of the important districts
                    of Indiana Territory.</p>

            <p>In a people's government, it sometimes happens that a faithful and efficient public servant
                    does not receive from his constituents the full credit which is his due. On the contrary, and
                    because of peculiar circumstances or turn of events over which he has no control, he is by many
                    misunderstood, misrepresented and unjustly criticized. In point, is.the administration of James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Putnam</settlement>
                    </placeName> Goodrich, governor of Indiana from January, 1917, to January, 1921. Goodrich was never
                    a man of many words, and throughout his life when criticized for an act or acts of his which he knew
                    to be right, he made no defense, and often no explanation. So, when there was any unjust criticism
                    of his administration as governor, he treated the matter as of little consequence.</p>
            <p>For some years, I have hoped that some contemporary of Goodrich, who knew the facts, would, in
                    justice of his memory, set them forth for the record. Since no one has done so, I have decided to do
                    it myself. I shall write in the first person, the reason for which will, I think, appear as I
                    proceed.</p>
            <p>My purpose in preparing this paper is not to write a biographical sketch, which, if well written,
                    would be interesting and worthwhile; nor is it my purpose to write a history of the administration
                    of Goodrich, though I may refer to some of his outstanding achievements as governor. The purpose I
                    have is twofold: the first is to present from my own knowledge the philosophy of politics and
                    government held by Goodrich. The second, and my primary purpose, is to assemble and make available
                    to the present generation and to future historians the plan and program of Goodrich as to taxation,
                    which he considered one of the most, if not the most, important problem facing him when he assumed
                    the governorship; how his plan and program were frustrated, and he was forced to abandon them, by
                    reason of which, and without any fault of his, he was by many misunderstood and unjustly criticized.</p>
            <p>My acquaintance with Goodrich began when we met in a Republican State Convention more than fifty
                    years ago; <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-043-1-046"/> that acquaintance ripened into a friendship which continued
                    until his death, August 15, 1940. The one thing he and I had in common through the years, was
                    Republican State politics. Each of us attended all Republican state conventions and other state
                    meetings of our party. For many years the Republicans had an annual meeting for a day during the
                    Christmas holidays in the old Denison Hotel. It was referred to as the Republican "Love
                    Feast." We missed none of these meetings. Goodrich was also active in the politics of his
                    county and congressional district, was elected Republican county chairman of his own county of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> before he was old enough to vote, and several times was the Republican chairman of his
                    congressional district. He was chairman of the Republican State Committee from 1901 to 1910, and as
                    such had charge of the state conventions of 1902, 1904, 1906, and 1908. There were in 1902 and 1904
                    two active groups of Republicans each seeking places on the Republican state ticket, and when the
                    ticket was completed each group was well-represented. I have known no campaign in Indiana when the
                    Republicans were so well united as in 1904, when, under his leadership, the Republican majority for
                    president and for state officers was more than ninety thousand, with the women not voting.</p>
            <p>Each of the state conventions of which he had charge was a two-day convention. The first
                    day's session was for the keynote address, the adoption of the platform, and to give the
                    delegates an opportunity to meet and confer with the candidates. The second day's session
                    was for the nomination of candidates by the delegates, not, as in recent years, when a few so-called
                    leaders fix up a slate of candidates to be ratified by the delegates, with adjournment about four
                    o'clock in the afternoon of the convention day. Goodrich was opposed to the Tammany system of party
                    management, which is always control of the party by a faction in the interest of the faction. He
                    believed in government by the people, and he had not lost confidence in the ability of the people of
                    Indiana to govern themselves. He believed, therefore, that the rank and file of a political party
                    should have something to say as to the nomination of candidates. If his party, in its convention,
                    adopted a policy or nominated a leading candidate contrary to his view, he did not leave his party,
                    but, within his party, he sought to reconcile differences. He did <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-043-1-047"/> not seek or accept a political appointment while state chairman, nor did he claim the right, as
                    state chairman, to name deputies of state or other officers. To him it, was fundamental that a
                    deputy or assistant in a public office should be appointed by and answer to his superior, and not
                    answer to any party chief. Such was his philosophy of political-party management. It is my view that
                    only in that way can government by the people, as we have known it in America, be indefinitely
                    maintained. If political parties in cities, counties, and states are to fall into the hands of
                    dictators, then it must ultimately follow that the nation will finally have a dictator in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Each of the four times I was a candidate for the nomination of the Indiana Appellate Court Judge at a
                    state convention of my party, I had the active support of Goodrich. With his active support I could
                    not have been and was not defeated for the nomination. When Goodrich was a candidate for governor in
                    the state-wide primary of 1916, I gave him my support. By his arrangement I was to meet him at his
                    state headquarters at seven o'clock in the evening on a certain day in the week for several weeks
                    before the primary election. So methodical was he that not one time did he fail to appear at his
                    headquarters to meet me at the time fixed.</p>
            <p>When Goodrich was governor, I was not a member of his official family. During the last two years of
                    his administration, however, I was one of the judges of the Appellate Court, with offices in the
                    Statehouse, and, therefore, was very familiar with the work of his administration. During his term
                    as governor, he was usually the first state officer to arrive at the Statehouse. Much of the time he
                    was at his desk in the governor's office at seven o'clock in the morning, rarely did he
                    arrive as late as nine o'clock. He gave the best he had every day, every week, every month, and
                    every year of his four-year term. He was the twenty-eighth chief executive of the state. He came to
                    the office in the prime of life when he was fifty-one years of age, became fifty-two February 18,
                    after his inauguration. Few men who so served the state came so well-prepared as he. He had the
                    usual experience of a country or country-town boy, the work of a farm boy, the country school and
                    high school, and a country schoolteacher. Then he went to college, studied law, <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-043-1-048"/> and became a county seat lawyer, and a good one. His character and
                    ability at once gave him financial credit, and soon he turned much of his attention to business. In
                    business he could not fail, for he had all the elements of character which make for business
                    success–industry, thrift, determination, confidence in himself, and intuitive knowledge
                    of men, and a wide knowledge of business affairs. So successful was he in business, that he amassed
                    a comfortable fortune before he was elected governor. After retiring from the governorship, he
                    continued in business and his fortune was increased. Not so long before his death, and in response
                    to my inquiry as to what he was doing, he stated that he was giving away his money and property, and
                    that is just what he was doing. During his lifetime, he gave away to education and charity
                    approximately one million dollars.</p>
            <p>While he was governor, he came to know that the per capita cost of a college education in a state
                    supported school was approximately four times the cost of a similar education in the privately
                    endowed colleges of the state, and that each year about one-half of the Indiana young men and women
                    receiving a college education were educated in nonstate colleges at no expense to the state. This
                    fact was one of the reasons why he gave most of his fortune to privately endowed Indiana colleges.</p>
            <p>In the state-wide primary for governor, 1916, the nomination of Goodrich was at no time in doubt. His
                    opponents were <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName> A. Myers and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> T. McCray. Myers had been a judge of the Indiana Supreme Court. McCray, who was
                    nominated and elected governor four years later, was a well-known farmer of large means who had been
                    active in farm organizations, including the State Fair. The primary campaign was for the most part a
                    campaign of organization, and the long experience of Goodrich in state politics and his fairness as
                    Republican state chairman were to his advantage, and he received about fifty thousand more votes
                    than both of his opponents. The fact that McCray was a farmer gave him support from that class, but
                    Goodrich was not without active farmer support. During the primary campaign, he addressed the State
                    Corn Growers' Association in which address he set forth the need for the revision of the Indiana tax
                    laws. He called attention to the fact, that, under the law as it then existed, there was
                    discrimination against the <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-043-1-049"/> farmer in that in listing his
                    property for taxation he was required to make a complete inventory of his livestock, grain, hay, and
                    other farm property, a method of listing not required of any other class of taxpayers. In his
                    discussion Goodrich called attention to a notable <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> birthday address delivered by former President Harrison at the Union League Club, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1898. The Harrison address, entitled "Duty of Rich People," was
                    an appeal for the fair and just taxation of the property of the rich or well-to-do citizens.
                    Goodrich, using some of the argument of Harrison, stated in substance, that the majority of the
                    people are lovers of justice and do not believe that poverty is a virtue or that property is a
                    crime; that it is not only wrong, but unsafe to discriminate in favor of or against any class in the
                    levy of taxes; and that equality is the golden thread which runs through the fabric of our American
                        civilization.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his speech to the Indiana Corn Growers' Association, Goodrich called attention to the enormous
                    intangible wealth in the state which was escaping taxation and quoted Fred A. Sims, who at that time
                    was an eminent authority on taxation in Indiana, as having expressed the opinion that "the
                    actual value of sequestered personal property of Indiana is more than the total of all the assessed
                    values of the State.''<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In closing his address, Goodrich again quoted Harrison,
                    who paraphrasing the famous statement of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> as to slavery, stated that "this country cannot continue to exist half free
                    and half taxed."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An outline of the Goodrich address to the, Corn Growers' Association was printed in pamphlet form and
                    widely circulated; not only in the primary, but the general election campaign, and, in my opinion,
                    brought to Goodrich many independent votes, and the votes of some progressive-minded Democrats, but
                    the election in Indiana in 1916 was no walkover for the Republican party, which had been out of
                    power in the state for eight years. The candidacy of Goodrich was fortunate for the Republicans,
                    first, because his ability was not questioned; and second, because of his fairness to all party
                    factions or groups when he was the Republican state <list type="footnotes">

                    liberal, for president that year, was helpful in uniting Indiana Republicans. Goodrich was elected
                    by a plurality of 12,771, which was approximately five thousand larger than the majority for the
                    national ticket. The Indiana Republicans also elected two <placeName>

                    the victory much credit was properly given to the leadership of Goodrich and Will H. Hays, the
                    Republican state chairman at that time.</p>
            <p>Many problems of state face an Indiana governor following the inauguration for the four-year term. It
                    was especially true, January, 1917. Chief among the problems facing Goodrich at that time was the
                    problem of taxation, the chief source of which was to be found in the tax provision of the state
                    constitution, which was, and still is, as follows: "The General Assembly shall provide, by
                    law, for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation, and shall prescribe such regulations
                    as shall secure a just valuation for taxation of all property. …"<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pursuant to this provision of the constitution, the General Assembly, soon after the adoption of the
                    constitution, enacted what was known as the general property tax statute. The constitution was
                    adopted in 1851, when the taxpayers, for the most part, from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName>, were farmers, home owners, and small-town shopkeepers. Under the circumstances, the
                    general property tax operated fairly well. But soon after the Civil War, there was rapid development
                    of financial, commercial and industrial institutions in all parts of the state, and a large amount
                    of wealth was accumulated and held by individuals and corporations. This vast wealth was largely in
                    intangible property, and much of it was escaping taxation. Furthermore, the people were demanding
                    more and more from the state, which demand had to be met by more and more taxes. Legislators began
                    to take notice, and in 1891 an act was passed creating the State Board of Tax Commissioners,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> which legislation was helpful but did not solve the problem.</p>

            <p>The first governor to attempt to do anything about this tax question was Thomas R. Marshall, who in
                    1911 caused the legislature to prepare and embody in one act what would have been a new and modern
                    constitution, with the provision that the same should, thereafter, be submitted to the people of the
                    state for ratification.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This act was at once attacked in court, and in the case of Ellingham <hi rend="i">v.</hi> Dye, the
                    Indiana Supreme Court in an opinion written by Judge Charles E. Cox, held that the act was
                    unconstitutional. In that opinion, however, the Supreme Court quoted with approval the following
                    paragraph from the text of John A. Jameson in <hi rend="i">A Treatise on Constitutional Conventions:</hi>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Long-established usage has settled the principle that a general grant of legislative power
                            carries with it the authority to call conventions for the amendment, or revision of the
                            constitution; and even where the only method provided in the constitution for its own
                            modification is by legislative submission of amendments, the better doctrine seems to be
                            that such provision, unless in terms restrictive, is permissive only, and does not preclude
                            the calling of a constitutional convention under the implied power of the legislative

            <p>Marshall was succeeded in January, 1913, by Samuel M. Ralston who recognized the importance of the
                    tax question, and, pursuant to an act of the legislature of that year, appointed a commission of
                    five to make a study of the tax question and report their findings, but little was accomplished. The
                    commission failing to agree, made four separate reports. The majority report, signed by three
                    members, recommended that the State Tax Board be abolished, and that, instead, there be created a
                    Tax Control Board with greater power and that the general property tax law be made more equitable.
                    The two minority members made separate reports, each suggesting laws which would require amendments
                    to the state constitution. The chairman of the commission made a separate report which was a reply
                    to the minority report.</p>
            <p>When Goodrich became governor, the general property tax law had remained unchanged for years being
                    unaffected by Marshall's efforts to secure a new constitution. Under the law, the farmers
                    and home owners were bearing an unjust burden of taxation, and many holders of large fortunes in

                    Goodrich, as was well known to his friends and business associates, had a keen sense of justice and
                    had already decided to do something to relieve the unjust tax burden which was being borne by the
                    owners of real estate and tangible personal property. He knew, that without a new state constitution
                    or amendments thereto, it would be impossible to raise by taxation sufficient revenue to meet the
                    growing needs of the state; and he knew that, under the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court, it
                    was then impossible to amend the constitution.</p>
            <p>Goodrich, being a resident of a county bordering <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, was quite familiar with the tax laws of both, states. He had seen the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> adopt a new constitution with much to their advantage. He had clients and friends who
                    owned lands on both sides of the state line, and he knew that the laws of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> did not place the burden upon the home owners of that state. As a lawyer, he knew that
                    all the legal authorities at that time upheld the right of a legislature of a state, with a
                    constitution such as Indiana, to call a constitutional convention. He also knew that the Indiana
                    Supreme Court, in the aforesaid opinion of Cox, had indirectly so held. He had the right to assume
                    and did assume, therefore, that the Indiana Supreme Court would so hold. In his first message to the
                    General Assembly, he recommended the enactment of a statute for the calling of a constitutional
                    convention to convene in January, 1918. The legislature, in response to the governor's
                    request, did promptly enact a statute calling for such a convention.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One reason the governor stated in his message to the legislature, as to why a constitutional
                    convention should be called, was that, under the repeated rulings of the Indiana Supreme Court, an
                    amendment of the constitution which had been submitted to the electorate fails of adoption, unless
                    approved by a majority of all the votes of those who vote at the election. In this connection it may
                    be stated, that twelve years after Goodrich's term of office had expired, a more liberal
                    Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Judge Walter E. Treanor, overruled all previous decisions of
                    the Supreme Court on that question and held that an amendment of the state constitution was adopted
                    if the amendment received <list type="footnotes">

                        amendment.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> This ruling of the Supreme Court makes the enactment of
                    constitutional amendments less difficult; in fact, it is now possible to adopt amendments desired by
                    the people. There is, therefore, now less need for a constitutional convention.</p>
            <p>The governor, in his message of 1917, also recommended the enactment of a statute providing for the
                    levy of excise taxes, and a bill for such a law was introduced.</p>
            <p>At the request of the governor, I was assisting in his office during the legislative session of 1917
                    and was, therefore, familiar with what took place. Soon after the excise tax bill was introduced,
                    large numbers of tax dodgers and men of wealth whose investments were in intangible property,
                    together with paid lobbyists, swarmed into the Statehouse to defeat the bill. I can best illustrate
                    what took place by quoting briefly from the governor's special message read to the General
                    Assembly in February asking for favorable action on the bill.. Among other things, the governor, in
                    his message said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"Prom the very beginning there has been a determined and constant effort upon the
                            part of certain special interests of the state, to block the legislative program. This
                            effort has constantly grown bolder, as the lobbyists in charge of the movement have felt
                            they had the situation in hand.</p>
                        <p>"Up to this time the lobby, which is seeking to thwart the expressed will of the
                            people of the state, has succeeded in delaying much legislation. It now believes it will be
                            able to carry out its reactionary program to the end. I hardly need to remind you that the
                            gentlemen here about the legislature, promoting special interests, do not represent the
                            people in the political sense of that term, yet I may remind you that the people do not
                            spend their time in and around the statehouse or the hotels entertaining lavishly, but they
                            are at home, going about their business, making the state a happy prosperous and good place

            <p>The advice of the governor was not heeded, the lobbyists prevailed, and the excise tax bill was
                    defeated. The legislature, in response to the request of the governor, had already passed the act
                    calling for a constitutional convention to meet in January, 1918. The governor was looking forward
                    to the time, during his administration when the state would <list type="footnotes">

                    but another disappointment was in store for him.</p>
            <p>The same interests which had defeated his excise tax bill promptly caused a suit to be commenced to
                    enjoin the calling of a constitutional convention. This suit was filed in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> Superior Court presided over by Judge William W. Thornton. The cause was advanced, and
                    Thornton promptly held valid the act passed by the legislature calling the convention. An immediate
                    appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, which court, in an opinion written by Judge Richard K. Erwin,
                    concurred in by a majority of the court, reversed the decision of Thornton and held that the General
                    Assembly had no authority to call a constitutional convention. There was a dissenting opinion by
                    Judge Moses B. Lairy. With due respect for Erwin and those members of the court who concurred with
                    him, it is my opinion that the conclusion of the court was contrary to the authorities, and that the
                    dissenting opinion of Lairy correctly stated the law.</p>
            <p>Inasmuch as the decisions of the Supreme Court as reported are usually not read, except by lawyers, I
                    shall here make available to those who may read this article the reasoning and conclusion reached in
                    the majority opinion of the Supreme Court. This, in my opinion, can best be done by quoting at
                    length from the dissenting opinion of Lairy who, among other things, stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The prevailing opinion holds that the act of the legislature of 1917, providing for the
                            calling of a constitutional convention and a preparation of a proposed constitution by such
                            convention and its submission to the people for their approval is unconstitutional and void
                            for two reasons: first, because the legislature possessed no power to call a constitutional
                            convention without first obtaining direct authority from the people to do so by means of a
                            vote on the proposition as to whether they desired a new constitution; and secondly, because
                            the act violates § 1, Art. 1 of the State Constitution, which provides that the
                            people have at all times an indefeasible right to alter and amend their form of government.
                            As to the power of the legislature, it is held that such body does not possess the power to
                            submit to the people for their vote the proposition as to whether or not they desire a new
                            constitution, but that this marks the limit of its power in respect to initiating a
                            proceeding of this kind unless and until a favorable vote is obtained upon that question,
                            after which it might proceed to call a convention in pursuance of authority thus obtained
                            from the people by their direct vote.</p>
                        <p>The holding that the legislature is without power in this respect <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-043-1-055"/> is based upon the proposition that the initiation of a movement
                            by that body for the calling of a constitutional convention is not ordinary legislation, and
                            for that reason, such power is not conferred by § 1, Art. 4 <hi rend="i">supra</hi>, by which all legislative power is conferred upon the general assembly. It is
                            said that the legislative power thus conferred carries authority to make and repeal laws as
                            rules of civil conduct pursuant to the Constitution and to carry out the details of
                            government so instituted, but that it does not carry or include authority for fundamental
                            legislation. The conclusion reached is that, as the power to originate a movement for a new
                            constitution by calling a convention is not granted by the section of the Constitution last
                            cited, the legislature cannot possess such power unless an express grant thereof be found in
                            some other part of the Constitution, or unless it be obtained by a direct vote from the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The statement that the legislature may obtain from the people the power to call a
                            constitutional convention, admits that the general assembly has power from some source to
                            institute a movement of this kind by providing for the submission of such question to a vote
                            of the people. This power is not directly conferred by the Constitution; and, under the
                            holding of the court, it is not one of the ordinary legislative powers granted by
                            § 1, of Art. 4, of the Constitution. Whence, then comes this power and what is
                            its nature? Within what limits may it be exercised, and how are such limits to be
                            fixed? As the majority opinion holds that the power is not a legislative power,
                            and that it is not conferred by the Constitution, it must be a political power resting in
                            the general assembly as the branch of government which most directly represents the people.
                            This power is not granted by the Constitution and that instrument places no limitations upon
                            it. Can the court limit a power of a co-ordinate branch of government, when the Constitution
                            imposes no limitations? If the legislature has power to initiate a movement of
                            this kind, which all concede, what right has the court to place a limitation upon the power
                            so long as its exercise does not conflict with any provision of fundamental law?
                            If the legislature has power to provide for the submission of the desirability of a new
                            constitution to a vote of the people and may afterward call a convention, why deny that it
                            has the power to call the constitutional convention first and provide that the desirability
                            of the new constitution shall be submitted to the people afterward? Neither of
                            such powers is expressly granted by the Constitution and neither of such acts is prohibited
                            by it.</p>
                        <p>When a co-ordinate branch of government assumes to exercise a political or governmental power
                            which is not forbidden by the Constitution and the scope of which is not limited thereby,
                            can the courts interfere with its exercise of fix limitations upon such power? It
                            is claimed that the case of <hi rend="i">Ellingham</hi> V. <hi rend="i">Bye</hi> (1912), 178
                            Ind. 336, 99 N.E. 1, Ann. Cas. 1915 C 200, 23 U.S. 205, 58 L. Ed. 206, and the authorities
                            there cited recognize the right of the courts to limit and control the exercise of such
                            powers; but an examination of the authorities cited will show that they go no further than
                            to hold that the courts may confine the exercise of such powers within the limits fixed by
                            the Constitution. When the Constitution provides that a power <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-043-1-056"/> shall be expressed in a particular manner, a failure to comply
                            with the provisions of the Constitution in any material respect will vitiate the act and the
                            courts have power to so declare .…</p>
                        <p>However, the power which is here asserted is not forbidden by the Constitution, the manner of
                            its exercise is not prescribed nor is the scope of its exercise limited by that instrument.
                            It is a political power abiding in the legislature which is an independent co-ordinate
                            branch of the state government. When the legislature representing the people assumes in the
                            exercise of such power to inaugurate a movement for a new constitution and to provide a
                            means by which the people may frame and adopt such a constitution, if they desire to do so,
                            I do not think that the judicial department can properly deny the power or confine its
                            exercise within limits not fixed by the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>The government of the state consists of three departments, the legislative, the judicial and
                            the executive. Each of the departments is independent of the other. Each is responsible for
                            its own acts, within constitutional limits, free from interference or control of any other
                            department of government. The legislative branch of the government provided a <hi rend="i">modus operandi</hi> by which the people of the State might frame and adopt a new
                            constitution, the executive branch of the government, according to the allegations of the
                            complaint, is about to proceed to carry out the provisions made to that end, but this court,
                            exercising the supreme judicial power of the State interferes and forbids further steps
                            toward carrying out the provisions thus made by the legislature.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution is the supreme law of the State and when an act of the legislature conflicts
                            with this basic law the Constitution must be upheld, and the act must fail in so far as it
                            is affected by such conflict. It is the province of the court to decide when a conflict
                            exists and this is determined from a consideration of the provisions of the Constitution in
                            connection with the act under consideration. One who asserts that an act of the legislature
                            is violative of the Constitution must point out the specific provision in that instrument
                            with which it conflicts. <hi rend="i">Haun V. State, ex rel.</hi> (1914), 183 Ind. 153, 155,
                            108 N.E. 519.</p>
                        <p>Before a court should strike down an act of the legislature, it must decide that the act in
                            question conflicts with one or more of the specific provisions of the Constitution. A court
                            may not overthrow an act of the legislature because, in its opinion, such act violates the
                            spirit of our institutions, or impairs rights which it is the object of a free government to
                            protect, or because it encroaches upon the natural rights of citizens. <hi rend="i">Townsend</hi> V. State (1896), 147 Ind. 624, 47 N. E. 19, 37 L. R. A. 294, 62 Am. St. 477.
                            If the legislation is not clearly in conflict with some express provision of the State or
                            federal Constitutions it must be upheld. <hi rend="i">Levy</hi> V. <hi rend="i">State</hi>
                            (1903), 161 Ind. 251, 68 N.E. 172.</p>
                        <p>Because it is the peculiar province of the courts to determine what the law is, it is their
                            duty, when two laws conflict to determine the force and effect of each. If a law is
                            challenged as being in conflict with a provision of the Constitution it is the duty of the
                            court to consider both the law and the Constitution to see if the statute <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-043-1-057"/> can be upheld and enforced without violating the Constitution.
                            To this end a court will construe a statute which is doubtful in its meaning in such a way,
                            if possible, as to reconcile it with the Constitution and every reasonable doubt will be
                            indulged in favor of its validity. The courts are very reluctant to strike down an act of
                            the legislature, but where the conflict between the statute and fundamental law cannot be
                            reconciled, the statute must yield to the superior force of the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>In passing the act of 1917, providing for the calling of a constitutional convention, the
                            legislature assumed the exercise of a power for which it alone is answerable to the people.
                            As before stated this is a political power which rests in the legislature as the
                            representative of the people. It is neither granted by the Constitution nor forbidden by it.
                            The manner of its exercise is not prescribed by that instrument and its scope is in no way
                            limited thereby. Under such conditions the court may not rightfully direct the manner in
                            which the power must be exercised, neither can it deny the power nor confine its exercise
                            within limits not fixed by the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>In assuming to exercise this power I have no doubt that the legislature acted in good faith
                            and in conformity with the oath taken by each member to the effect that he would support and
                            uphold the Constitution. In determining that it had such power, it was not without
                            respectable authority and precedent. No one denies the right of the people to adopt a new
                            constitution whenever they may desire to do so. Our Constitution makes no provision as to
                            how this may be done. All authorities seem to agree that if a change of the form of
                            government is to be accomplished without a revolution it must be done with the assent of the
                            constitutional government. The movement must originate somewhere. As the legislature
                            directly represents the people, it has been generally regarded as the appropriate body to
                            initiate a movement of this kind; and, in most, if not all, of the states where new
                            constitutions have been adopted, the movement has originated in the legislature. All writers
                            on constitutions and constitutional law agree in saying that the power to call a
                            constitutional convention for a state resides in the legislature where the existing
                            constitution provides no other means.</p>

                        <p>One further question remains to be considered. Does the plan of procedure embodied in the act
                            of 1917 conflict with § 1, Art. 1 of the State Constitution, which reserves to
                            the people the indefeasible right to alter and reform their government? Under the
                            plan adopted, the people have a right through delegates elected for that purpose to frame
                            the constitution which would contain such alterations and reformations in the form of
                            government as seemed proper to the delegates and after the constitution was so framed the
                            people by their vote would have a right to accept or reject the changes thus offered. To my
                            mind the plan adopted by the act does not in any way or to any extent impair or abridge the
                            rights of the people under this section of the Bill of Rights; but, on the other hand it
                            provides a means by which the people may exercise their indefeasible right to alter and
                            reform their government.</p>

            <p>This opinion, Bennett <hi rend="i">v.</hi> Jackson, holding that the act calling a constitutional
                    convention was unconstitutional, was handed down July 17, 1917, which was approximately eighteen
                    months before the meeting of the next legislature, and, the excise tax measure having been defeated,
                    the only way left to raise more money under the general property tax was by increasing rates or by
                    increasing property values for taxation. That plan was never popular with taxpayers, and there was
                    much criticism, some of it lodged against the governor by persons who did not understand the facts.
                    When the eighteen months had passed, the legislature of 1919 came to the Capitol. The governor in
                    his message reported the action of the Supreme Court as to the constitutional convention and
                    recommended that the General Assembly should submit certain amendments to the state constitution,
                    among which was an amendment empowering the legislature to classify property for the purpose of
                    taxation and otherwise broaden the power of the legislature as to methods of taxation including the
                    income tax. The governor, however, remembering that his excise tax bill had been defeated two years
                    before by the State Senate and finding that twenty-five members of that body were back in their
                    seats as holdovers and further finding that the special interests which had defeated his tax program
                    were not only more powerful, but encouraged by <list type="footnotes">

                    being a practical man decided not to press his program for excise tax legislation which he
                    definitely knew would again be defeated, but sought the co-operation of the General Assembly in
                    order to bring about the enactment of other important laws which were a part of his general program
                    when he became governor.</p>
            <p>Following the re-election of President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, the reactionaries in both the
                    Republican and Democratic parties were soon on the ascendant, so much so that the Republicans
                    nominated and the people elected <placeName>

                    </placeName> G. Harding president in 1920. Then followed an era of complacency in the state and
                    nation until the financial crash and panic of 1929. It is sometimes referred to as the
                    "business depression"; but it was a panic just the same, and the worst in American
                    history; and with the panic came, in Indiana, a financial emergency which had to be met by taxation.
                    To raise sufficient revenue under the general property tax statute would have meant confiscation in
                    many instances. There was then no time to amend the constitution. Something had to be done. Governor
                    Paul V. McNutt and the legislature of 1933 arose to the occasion. There were enacted two tax
                    statutes, the gross income and intangible tax laws.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Each of these statutes was
                    held constitutional as an excise tax law. The gross income tax law was correctly so held in an
                    excellent well-reasoned opinion written for the court by Judge Michael L. Fansler.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The intangible tax law was held to be constitutional by the narrowest margin. The principal opinion
                    written by Judge James P. Hughes was concurred in by Judge George L. Tremain, with Judge Treanor
                    concurring only in the result. Judges Fansler and Curtis Roll dissented with an opinion.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> It is my view, that the better reasoning is found in the dissenting opinion.
                    With a Supreme Court of different personnel, the opinion upholding the intangible tax act might yet
                    be overruled.</p>
            <p>If Goodrich could have had a constitutional convention, and a new and modern constitution had been
                    adopted, the validity of an intangible tax law, with different valuations of property in different
                    classes, could not be questioned.</p>

            <p>In any event, the enactment of these two tax laws was most fortunate for the state. They met the
                    emergency and produced sufficient revenue to meet the expenses of state government to keep open the
                    schools and made possible the reduction of taxes on thousands of Indiana homes. These laws may have
                    had, and may still have, some defects, but they have met the general approval of the people. The
                    repeal of neither has been sought by the three Republican legislatures since their enactment nor by
                    the Republican governor now in the Statehouse.</p>
            <p>To me, the facts and circumstances recited in this paper, including the tax legislation under the
                    administration of Mc-Nutt, and the attitude of state administrations since, all add up to this: That
                    the tax program of Goodrich set forth in his message to the legislature of 1917, including his
                    recommendation for the calling of a constitutional convention and an excise tax statute, shows his
                    wisdom and foresight, and that the criticism lodged against him on that score has been unjust.</p>
            <p>In politics and government Goodrich was a true liberal. He was, of course, in no sense a radical,
                    much less was he a standpatter. He was for progress, and with progress he advocated such changes in
                    the basic and other laws as were necessary to meet new or changed conditions.</p>
            <p>For many years, I have been hearing criticism of the administration of Goodrich in reference to his
                    advocacy and administration of Indiana tax laws. I have known that the criticisms were unfounded and
                    unjust. I have had much satisfaction and some pleasure, therefore, in the preparation df this
                    article.</p>
            <p>If, by this article, I have refreshed the memory of those who knew Goodrich and were familiar with
                    the work of his administration, and if I have added to the knowledge of his political activity and
                    his philosophy of party politics and of government, and if I have made clear his plan and program
                    for a new state constitution and reform of the Indiana tax laws, and how his plans and program were
                    frustrated, by reason of which he was misunderstood, misrepresented, and unjustly criticized, my

            <p>In the first decade of this century while Edward Eggleston was accepted as the sole portrayer of
                    realistic rural Hoosierdom and Riley was the recorder of friendly "folk romance"
                    in rustic dialect, there appeared in a magazine of minor importance and in a few religious journals
                    a limited number of stories by an unknown woman who used the name of Forest Blake.</p>
            <p>With the exception of one or two, these stories deserve consideration as contributions to the social
                    history of Indiana and to the realism of post-frontier days. They contain beauty and neighborliness
                    as do the stories of Dorothy Canfield Fisher without the hopelessness sometimes evident in her
                    stories. They are not marred by the repression of Mary W. Freeman; they show lives limited by
                    circumstances, but not cramped or sordid. These are social documents as truly as the stories that
                    deal with labor discontents or great depressions or racial antagonisms, or any form of social
                    discontent. They are the realism of the commonplace. If stark and ugly facts are missing it is not
                    because, as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> L. Par-rington said to William D. Howells, the author had a "dislike of
                    looking ugly facts in the face"; rather, the facts at which Miss Blake looked were not
                    ugly.</p>
            <p>The locale of Miss Blake's stories is that of Eggleston, the southern Indiana hills, but
                    with a difference. Writing of <hi rend="i">The Hoosier Schoolmaster</hi> and <hi rend="i">The
                        Mystery of Metropolisville</hi>, Ima Honaker Herron in <hi rend="i">The Small Town in American
                        Literature</hi> says that Eggleston "describing with a strict fidelity the barrenness
                    of life in the Middle West, eventually tended to put the mark of realism on other literature of the
                        region."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> I take exception to the words "strict
                    fidelity" only if by them Miss Herron means a complete as well as a true picture. I present
                    the Han' El' stories by Forest Blake as describing "with fidelity," provincial
                    people, in an isolated rural community in Indiana.</p>
            <p>My claim for Miss Blake as a writer of realistic fiction of the Hoosier state rests primarily on her
                    stories of a country girl, Han' El' (Hannah Ellen) who lived in the "mid-eighties"

                    The school which she attended was ten or fifteen years younger than Eggleston's
                    "Flat Creek deestrict." During her last year a uniform course of study for eight
                    grades was announced for the state and this was the year that eighth grade township examinations
                    made their debut in the Indiana school system. A commencin', new to these provincials, was held and
                    Han' El' chose for her essay subject "Daniel Webster"; and she wrote it
                    "with purple ink on foolscap paper, rolled it and tied it with red ribbon."</p>

                    old folks, friends. Han' El' kept her hair in curl papers until they reached the woodshed, where,
                    with the help of her sister Hetty, the hair became a "mass of Ethiopian frizz."
                    They returned to the two-story hewn-log house; in the front yard were the ash hopper, the big iron

            <p>Han' El' met deception and disappointment; she taught her first school; she touched romance in a

            <p>Another tale, "A Dream of Elizabeth Han'," is similar and in certain respects
                    identical with the Han' El' stories/ The schoolgirl in her calico dress and gingham apron trimmed
                    with red cross-stitch, wearing a red bow at her neck and one in her hair, must spend her time,
                    having learned all the school had to offer, decorating the dog-eared school books– until
                    she hears of the township examinations. Elizabeth Han', after her eighth grade examination, was
                    permitted to attend a five weeks' summer normal course and a week's Teacher's
                    Institute before she began her teaching. Her six weeks away from home made her dissatisfied with the
                    interior of their two-story hewn-log house. The furnishings she had "not questioned until
                    her horizon broadened were "whitewashed walls and floors covered with rag carpet which,
                    after spring housecleaning, fairly bulged with straw underneath. In the living-room, where the
                    fireplace was, there were two beds and a trundle-bed. The adjoining room was the parlor, and was
                    furnished with the newest rag carpet, a bureau, and a spare bed." There were pillow shams,
                    cotton tidies, gorgeous paper flowers, coffee-sacking rugs, picture frames of cornstalks tied at the
                    corners with purple yarn. Elizabeth Han' "set a dozen old hens," and in
                    "June hauled off a big coop of early fries to the store and traded them out for clothes for
                    the normal." Humble almost humorous, simple in expression but true in picture.</p>
            <p>These were the exteriors, the customs, the tools and the utensils of the people of the hills of
                    Indiana in the eighties. But the character is also there. Miss Blake sketches it unmistakably. Toil
                    has sobered but not embittered nor degraded them. They have love and pride of family; they have
                    simple pleasures and simple piety. There is in these stories none of the "cheapness, this
                    newness, and this ugliness, loosely tied in temporary cohesions, which furnished the materials of
                    provincialism for Edward Eggleston."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>The plots in these stories have verisimilitude. They are the outgrowth of the lives of these people.
                    These plots sometimes end with a philosophic or religious conclusion arrived <list type="footnotes">

                    Blake presents, that is true. Her characters are one dimensional except her name characters. Mr.
                    Burke, of the Han' El' stories, with his squeaky shoes and his nervous manner comes to life,
                    momentarily. Effie Black barely escapes being too typically the villainess, even to her name. Like
                    criticism is applicable to many stories of this length.</p>
            <p>The style she uses is lucid, fluent, and suitable to the subject matter in simplicity. The
                    descriptions are brief, but clear cut; the figurative language is natural, without strain for the
                    unused, but withal fresh and honest. The picture of Han' El' in her graduation dress illustrates:
                    "The tight sleeves stopped about three inches from the top of the
                    ‘half-hands’ that Han' El' wore, leaving a wide bracelet of tanned arm
                    between. The bottom of the skirt rose high in front and sagged downward in the back, like a chicken
                    standing in the rain."</p>
            <p>In addition to the stories mentioned, "A Biography," the story of a gray farm cat
                    might, without too great disapproval of the critics, be classed with the realistic group. Two
                    stories might be classed with the psychological studies although they are not profoundly so; they
                    are "The Burden of Genius" and "The Siege of Fourteen." Another
                    story handles, with insight though with sentimentality, the results of the gossip in a smug little
                    town–"The Mother of George Alone: Senseless Gossip Winds Itself Up and Runs
                    Itself Down." Several articles and a novel by this author do not come within the province
                    of this paper.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>After fourteen years of able leadership Eli Lilly declined renomination to the presidency of the
                    Indiana Historical Society at the annual meeting' in December. These fourteen years were productive
                    of more good things for the Society and its membership than any single period in its long history.
                    Much of this success has been directly due to the retiring president, and in appreciation these
                    accomplishments should be summarized and brought to the attention of the membership.</p>
            <p>Lilly's principal interest is in the prehistoric phases of our history, but this came about
                    through the medium of local history. About 1929 he decided to write a history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Kosciusko County</region>
                    </placeName> where he had spent summer vacations since boyhood on the shores of Lake Wawasee. This
                    task was to absorb some of his unbounded energy during the vacation period of that and perhaps
                    following years. His research advanced through the introductory stages and geological aspects and
                    reached the point where the Indian of history and prehistory had to be considered. In order to
                    obtain some information on Indian artifacts and materials he called upon his old friend, J. P. Dolan
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Syracuse</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and looked over his "cabinet" of Indian relics. While thus engaged
                    he must have displayed considerable interest, for it was not long until Dolan took Mr. and Mrs.
                    Lilly to see the collection of Albert Adis in Noble County. Here he probably saw objects of Indian
                    origin that surpassed his previous expectations, for the Adis collection was rich in slate
                    "ceremonial" forms of all kinds.</p>
            <p>That the materials he had seen in the Dolan and Adis collections made a deep impression upon him is
                    suggested by the fact that the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Kosciusko County</region>
                    </placeName> was passed up for a much bigger project. He began to acquire his magnificent collection
                    of Indiana archaeological material which has since been given to the Society. The foundation for
                    this collection was obtained from Thomas Hendricks, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who has long been an enthusiastic collector of artifacts.</p>
            <p>Just as an awakened knowledge of the existence of great quantities of archaeological material lead
                    him to a study of the Indian and his works, so did the acquisition of objects <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-043-1-068"/> make him realize that these things had a story to tell and that data
                    pertaining to prehistory was here for the seeking but doomed to ultimate extinction if not soon
                    recovered. As a result of this realization he soon gave up collecting and devoted his time and
                    talents to the problems of our Indian heritage.</p>
            <p>By the spring of 1931 he was eager to see archaeological work carried out in Indiana by the Society,
                    and when the late <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> K. Moorehead came to the state in May for a site reconnoissance Lilly was the most
                    enthusiastic member of the party on the tour. This pilgrimage to some of the shrines of prehistory
                    prompted active field work during the summer and a policy of research which has continued to date.</p>
            <p>His first published work was the "Bibliographhy on Indiana Archaeology" issued May,
                    1932, as a number of the <hi rend="i">
                        <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin.</hi>
                    </hi> This publication listed every printed item dealing with the archaeology of each of the
                    ninety-two counties in the state. This was an outstanding contribution for such a bibliography is
                    badly needed for every state, but all too few have them. In December, 1932, he was elected president
                    of the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
            <p>Between 1931 and 1937, he gathered notes and data necessary for writing <hi rend="i">
                        <hi rend="i">Prehistoric Antiquities of Indiana,</hi>
                    </hi> a volume issued to the membership of the Society in 1937. This work was instantly acclaimed in
                    professional circles throughout the country. It synthesized the best thought on all the many and
                    varied aspects of the archaeological problem without the personal element being injected into it.
                    Copious footnotes gave ample evidence of the tremendous amount of reading and study which made the
                    text possible. The illustrations we're an innovation in that they presented archaeological specimens
                    in a manner which was at once both scientifically acceptable and esthetically pleasing. Of all the
                    publications of the Society this volume, more than any other, has focused the attention of those
                    interested in history upon Indiana.</p>
            <p>In 1937, he authorized the inauguration by the Society of a new publication–the <hi rend="i">
                        <hi rend="i">Prehistory Research Series.</hi>
                    </hi> This provided an outlet independent of the <hi rend="i">
                        <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi>
                    </hi> for any and all subject matter pertaining to American anthropology which the Publications
                    Committee found acceptable.</p>
            <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-043-1-069"/>
            <p>Recognizing the need for time perspective in prehistory, he also authorized the Society to establish
                    a series of fellowships in the study of ceramics, physical types and languages. These fellowships
                    were conceived to bring to a single focal point, with history and archaeology as the nucleus, all
                    data from which a sequence of events might be derived and from which a chronology might evolve.
                    These studies have been eminently successful.</p>
            <p>The Walam Olum, the only recorded Indian document having any bearing upon Indiana prehistory, has
                    absorbed his interest for several years. This migration legend of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> Indians was recorded by means of pictographs on sticks and was obtained, apparently
                    from the Indians on <geogName>White River</geogName>, by a Dr. Ward. The sticks, or at least copies
                    of the pictographs, came into the hands of Constantine S. Rafinesque, who later obtained the Indian
                    words to accompany the figures. Rafinesque and others published on this document many years ago, and
                    in these writings Lilly recognized features which convinced him of the validity of the story as a
                    historical document. Once more applying the methods of triangulation to the problem, approaches have
                    been made from the angles of history, archaeology, language, ethnology, and physical type. He took
                    upon himself the task of verifying and proving the correctness of the pictographic figures. So
                    proficient has he become in this phase of the study that he was able to note several instances where
                    previous authors had made inadvertent transpositions of figure parts and which had changed their
                    significance considerably.</p>
            <p>One of the sites visited on the 1931 pilgrimage previously referred to was the Angel Site near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This is by far the most important site in Indiana. The extensive village area, the
                    remnants of the encircling stockade, and the group of mounds presided over by the great central
                    mound made a lasting impression on all members of the party. Lilly rued the fact that "we
                    sit idly by, letting these precious chances slip through our fingers." When, in 1938, it
                    seemed that the Angel Site was doomed to destruction he did not hesitate in authorizing the Society
                    to purchase such tracts of land as were required to preserve the site. In order to do this it was
                    necessary to use funds which had been established for the erection of an archaeological museum. In
                    making the decision he was well aware that a museum <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-043-1-070"/> might be
                    built anytime, but a mound group once lost is lost forever. Once more, we have here an instance of a
                    scientific mind dominating a human heart for he had long cherished the idea of a museum wherein our
                    treasures might 'receive the public attention they merit.</p>
            <p>Within the past few years Indiana University displayed an increasing interest in anthropology, which
                    now bids fair to become a firmly established part of the curriculum. This welcome interest can be
                    traced directly to Lilly's leadership and his activity in drawing to the Society and state
                    individuals interested in their several fields, yet whose prime purpose is co-ordination of effort.
                    The bond which has always existed between the Society and Indiana University has, thereby, become
                    more cohesive.</p>
            <p>In declining renomination to the presidency of the Society, he merely gave voice to his conviction
                    that some one else should have the pleasure of leadership which had been his to enjoy for so long.
                    His gratification in directing the affairs of the Society have not been at all one-sided for
                    everyone who has worked with him has derived joy from the association. This is borne out by the
                    resolution passed by the Executive Committee and Society membership in attendance at the annual
                    meeting to wit: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The Sixteenth Indiana Regiment was a widely traveled unit as well as one of diverse experiences. An
                    account of its adventures to the date of November, 1863, was given in an editorial of <hi rend="i">The Volunteer</hi>, a small paper devoted chiefly to the Sixteenth.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This
                    paper, which was found in the correspondence of a Union soldier, William H. Jordan, furnishes
                    corroboration for the letters of that soldier. The editorial is printed with the letters in which he
                    described particularly two phases of the Regiment's experiences: the six months preceding
                    the fall of Vicksburg and the six subsequent months.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>In these letters the complicated and difficult nature of the attacks on Vicksburg were indicated by

                    through Old River, and by the attack on <placeName>

                    <p>Men are always disposed to be jealous of the good name of the organization of which they are a
                        part. In military life esepcially where pride makes men brave, is it proper they should think
                        the Regiment or Corps to which they belong the best. As members of the 16th Regiment without
                        vanity, may we well be proud of the marches, hardships and battles. To some of us who have been
                        with it during the war, both carriug a gun and wearing a sword, it affords us pleasure to think
                        of the days and weeks that have glided into month and years since we first donned the

                        Sternly determined our Regiment, gathered up its thin ranks knowing they had not wisely been led
                        into the conflict; but doing their work as Americans in many climes and on many fields, have
                        performed their duty bravely and well. A hundred and eighty of our regiment escaped, two hundred
                        were killed and wounded, and the remander were prisoners.–While we thought of Lt.
                        Col. Wolfe, <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-043-1-073"/> dying a heroes death, with Link, Topping and
                        Conklin, with stern and bitter satisfaction we thought that a many a rebel had fired his last

                        the wounded and we tired and worn out prisoners. The shadowy gloom settled down upon many a

                        that started so proudly down the great river to redeem the promise that Logan made for the
                        "men of the North-West. On Christmas day, at Millikens Bend, our Brigade under the
                        gallant Burbridge, made a daring raid into Lousania to cut the Western Railroad. Tho' white
                        cotton-fields by the side of dark bayous and palm, under the tall cypress trees festooned with
                        the Spanish moss, we marched to Dalis. We made sixty miles in thirty-six hours, leaving
                        distroyed behind us twelve miles of railroad, four bridge an da million dollars worth of cotton.
                        The next day we sailed down the river, and sweeping up the Yazoo, our army disembarked and threw
                        ilself with hopeless efforts again and again upon the fortifications that crowned the Walnut
                        Hills. Our Regiment, though under the fire of shells, fortunately escaped the massaere of
                        Chickasaw Bayou. On New Years night wiser and I hope sadder, our General learned the nature of
                        the contest and silently drew his army back to the boats. Then northward to <geogName>White

                        </placeName> to near the Post. Cold and wet, vainly trying to sleep praying that morning would
                        come while the beleagureing army completely encircled the rebel forces in their works, we rested
                        on the eve of the battle. On Sunday the eleventh of January, the 16th was the advance regiment
                        of Burbridge's Brigade that led the charging columns at <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                        </placeName> Post. Who that was there will ever forget it. Four hours of the gun-boats awful
                        thunder, the roar of musketry and the smoke of battle, that hung above the ruined works and
                        dismounted cannon above the dead and dying of both armies, rolled away laaving proudly waiving
                        above us brighter and puer our flag of glorious beauty. Our Regiment lost sixty-seven out of
                        three hundred, and our Brigade lost more than the rest of the army. Then we sailed down the
                        river to Young's Point, where ensued the dark day of the 16th. Long will we remember
                        with horror the muddy camps, when sickness and death were around us, with scarcely enough well
                        men to bury the dead, and where the levee, the only dry spot of land, was thickly dotted with
                        graves of those who will stand no more among us. In March we moved to Milliken's Bend,
                        where the general health rapidly improved. From this point the 13th Army Corps started on that
                        march througd the bayous of Lonisiana, which found the open door of Vicksburg. Time and space
                        forbid details of those battles fought whose history would requre a volume instead of a page. We
                        can but mention names that belong to history now that will make each man so proud to say in
                        after years he was in Grant's army.–Port Gibson, Champion Hills, Black River
                        Bridge, and that <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-043-1-074"/> dreadful charge of the 22d of May
                        inaugurated the memorable siege.– Then day and night almost constantly on duty, the
                        men of the 16th were on picket or in the trenches until on the birth-day of our Nation
                        "Down with the traitors and up with the stars," was sung by the victorious
                        army in the streets of Vicksburg, On the 5th of July, before our guns had hardly cooled off, we
                        were on the march after Johnson. This was one of our hardest campaigns. Without a change of
                        clothing or a half enough to eat, for ten days within range of rifle bullets, and Jackson was
                        evacuated.–Then back to Vicksburg, and for the first time since leaving Indiana the
                        16th had a few weeks rest. Robert Conover, who had, like Jacob for Rachel, served long and
                        faithfully, was here made Major. The Regiment moved to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                        </placeName>, and with one turn of the crank in the General's tent, the 16th was Mouted
                        Intfantry. A scont to Donaldsonville was the per-cursor of the present expedition. This is a
                        hurried sketch of the past, but a word for the present and future. Should a man from the 16th
                        starve, when chickens abound? Nay, verily. Shall the Reb's wrath be a stench
                        in the nostril when good horses are found in the stables? Not while Co.
                        "K" liveth. And if Co. B feedeth at midnight on the Frenchman's
                        poultry, making him believe they are as good Rebs as ever ate corn bread: shall we not follow
                        their example? Yea, muchly, even if it maketh another who is likewise deceived and
                        suckered in. With "Uncle Tom," (on whose shoulders we hope soon will glitter
                        the star he has so richly won), and Conover, Redfield, the "cool Major" of the

                                    it was a well fought Battle [not] any particular advantage being gained by either
                                    side- Sunday night and Monday our Company was on duty as Picket Guard and

                                    Rebels had an earthwork on the other side of the Bayou within two or three Hundred
                                    Yards of ours and they fired away at each other all day doing some of the heaviest
                                    musketry firing I ever heard and an occasional shell dropped into the woods where we
                                    were lying Kept our Brigade in a high state of excitement all day- During the day

                                    intrenchments where they were obliged to lay all day as they were not strong enough
                                    to take the fort and could not get back to the bridge without drawing the fire of
                                    other earthworks- they lay so near the enemys works that when a gun was put over the
                                    top of the Breastwork they could catch it with their hands- when they came back that
                                    night they left 26 of their number on the field- that night was the last firing of
                                    the Battle of Vicks-burgh next morning we went to building breast works and taking
                                    up heavy seige guns- Wednesday I came down to the Boat and spent New Years day
                                    working on Pay Rolls after dark orders came to be ready to move and every thing was
                                    loaded on the Boats- about 10 0 clock here they came Officers and men Seige
                                    Batteries and Field Batteries Generals Escorts and Wagon trains in a long line and
                                    on to the boats and everything quiet again until morning and that ended the seige of
                                    Vicksburgh- Yesterday as we watched the long line of Steamers shoving out one by one
                                    under the protection of the Gun-bots there was many a sad looking face and many

                                    Saturday evening we moved to the front and received a heavy fire of shells from the
                                    fort one of which burst in a tree killing one and wounding three of Co B pieces of

                                    kind of promiscuously but soon rallied and came to our support the 16th except the
                                    two left companies B &amp; G did nobly the colors of the Regt never moved back
                                    an inch althouh we were under a heavy fire for over three hours when the white flag
                                    went up and we went into the fort Co E fought well although without officers Capt
                                    Terrill could not Keep up when we advanced and Lieut Stevenson got lost from his
                                    company when the left retreated I saw both during the fight they were at the left of
                                    the Regiment where Co B. should have been but of which nothing was left except Lieut

                                    done I had to give it up that big guns are of some force- the fort mounted three
                                    seige guns one pivot and two casemate besides one or two batteries of field
                                    Artillery on the walls and along the Rifle Pits- the casemate guns were very large
                                    being nine inch columbiads and the Pivot gun a 9 inch rifled Dahlgreen the balance
                                    six and twelve pounders the Casemates for the two guns were built in the form of a
                                    small house of very heavy hewed timber set upright the roof of the same with the
                                    addition of a coat of inch iron on the outside they were literally torn to pieces
                                    balls and shell from the Gunboats going through iron &amp; wood and into the
                                    casemates destroying everything in their way- one ball from a Gunboat struck one of
                                    the Columbiads and knocked the whole end off others dismounted nearly all the field
                                    guns in the fort in short they desroyed nearly everything in their range and forced
                                    the Con-feds to surrender- Sunday night we went back to our camp in the woods and
                                    remained there until monday night when we were called on to guard prisoners- were on

                                    Division and have now been on duty two days- I consider it a piece of very good luck
                                    as it is the easiest position in the Division I have twenty ambulances one Wagon
                                    Fifty-four horses and mules and a tent and horse and saddle for my own use with
                                    nothing to do but see that the men get their supplies and make the details for duty

                                    of the Division I think I shall like the place very well if I have to go down the

                        <p>.… Since I wrote we have made another retreat and now have every thing
                                    concentrated at this place which at present is the head of Steamboat navigation on
                                    Bayou Teche and an important point if it is part of the plan of the campaign to hold

                        <p>We dont know what to think of our success in this campaign there have been no heavy
                                    battles and as long as our Army advanced the enemy retreated but as soon as we
                                    turned back they were close after us and have captured every straggler and forage
                                    train that fell in their way- The men call it Potomac War a great deal of strategy
                                    but very little fighting</p>
                        <p>The Cavalry Division started on some Kind of an Expedition this morning at 1
                                    O'clock it was thought to try to bring on a General Engagement- I hear
                                    yarns about prisoners captured and Regiments surprised but will believe nothing
                                    until our Regt comes back</p>
                        <p>I believe that Bayou <placeName>

                                    tired of before we left- I dont Know why it was- there was nothing there but the
                                    woods where we had our camp and the Bridge we burnt when we left but there was a
                                    fine country very near us and the town not far off and there was excitement enough
                                    in our duties to Keep us awake and the Blue Devil off I have done no duty with the
                                    Regiment for some days except in the retreat and think it doubtful if I do for some
                                    days to come I have quit volunteering my services and find I have an easier time

                        <salute>Dear Mother</salute>
                        <p>I received your letter of Nov 30th and the papers you sent the other day was glad to
                                    get them as news are a scare article in this country- we sometimes get <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                                    </placeName> papers but praises of Gen. Banks and long speeches about the <hi rend="i">Free</hi> State of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                                    </placeName>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have no news in this army- everything is very quiet here but we begin to see signs
                                    of a move- which way it will be I dont know but it is generally thought that it will
                                    be in the dirrection of Breashear City</p>
                        <p>Orderly Simms started home the other day and I have forgotten if I wrote you since- I
                                    sent you $100- by him which you can use as you see proper try and hire
                                    some one to do your work and live as easy as you can. I wish I could send you a
                                    nigger in a letter we have more here than we have use for</p>
                        <p>The last of the 13th Army Corp left here a few days ago and a few Regts of the
                                    Cavalry Division are all the western troops left and I think they would all prefer
                                    to be back in the old Department</p>
                        <p>We have had a very pleasant winter so far a few cold days and a few rainy nights when
                                    picket duty was not agreeable but we find that in any country in the winter- if we
                                    dont find harder times than since we left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                                    </placeName> I will be satisfied</p>
                        <p>The Court Martial on which I have been serving so long adjourned to-day and I
                                    reported to the Regt for duty I suppose that if there is a call soon for a detail
                                    from this Regt. I will have to go as there is but one other line officer not in
                                    command I think I shall try to go home in the spring now Leaves of Absence are out
                                    of the question and very few can resign except for the good of the service and I
                                    dont care about going out that way</p>
                        <p>I will write again if we move soon</p>

                        <p>We are again in Camp in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and have begun regular camp duty- to-day was the first Sunday
                                    Inspection we have had for three months- although we have been so few days here the
                                    men are wishing themselves back in the field but we will probably stay here some
                                    time as the Regiment has been placed in Garrison to perfect itself in drill and
                                    Military discipline</p>
                        <p>We left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                                    </placeName> on the morning of the 19th and marched to Berwick the same day waited
                                    all that night and nearly all the next day before we could get ferried over the bay
                                    then waited until next morning before the cars would start got to Algiers that night

                                    in an old Brick Yard .…</p>
                        <p>I should like very well to come home if the Eegt is to remain in quarters but think
                                    the prospect poor- if they will not let me resign I may accept a position in one of
                                    the Nigger Regts.</p>
                        <p>The weather for some days has been very pleasant and the Roads are good again the
                                    Planters in the La Fourche Country have begun their plowing and we expect to begin
                                    our springs work in a <hi rend="i">few</hi> weeks- The health of the Regt is very
                                    good but I expect to hear of sickness before long as the men will eat all the pies
                                    and other trash they have money to buy</p>
                        <p>I believe there is nothing that I want you could send by Orderly Simms as we can buy
                                    almost anything here but have to pay dearly for everything- I hope Simms will
                                    succeed in recruiting enough men to entitle him to his Commission.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Fitzgerald expects to start for home to-day and has promised to take this letter
                                    for me it will not be necessary for me to write much for he can tell you all the
                                    news if there is any- He will take you two copies of a Photograph of the Court
                                    Martial on which I am serving- one of which please Keep for me, as I wish to have it
                                    framed when I come home.</p>
                        <p>Our Regiment is under marching orders- it is supposed for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                                    </placeName> but it may be some other place- I will not go with the Regt unless
                                    relieved from duty here which I do not expect</p>
                        <p>I went to the Theatre for the first time a few nights ago- met Mr. John F. Collins
                                    who is Deputy Collector of Customs for this Port- he has his family here and is
                                    taking an active part in the present political Campaign- I have not seen his family
                                    yet called once but the ladies were out- will call again in a few days and write you
                                    what I think of them- he has two very pretty children</p>
                        <p>… I have pay due from the 1st of Nov. but do not know when I will get it
                                    as there is no money in the Department at present. my pay will just about keep me in
                                    the company I am obliged to keep while on this duty but I can save some when we go
                                    in the field again and will send what I can to you to Keep things going until I can
                                    get out of the Army</p>
                        <p>I am in good health as I have been since we left Vicksburgh. I think the climate here
                                    agrees with me as well as that at home</p>

                        <p>You will see from the heading of my letter that I have made another move. I left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                                    </placeName> last Tuesday morning came to Brashear City on the cars and then to this
                                    place by Steamboat found all well and quiet- our tent pitched on the same ground it
                                    was on when we were here in January- it very seldom happens that we camp twice in
                                    the same place but it may be more than once in the coming Campaign as we will
                                    probably march over our old route of last October- troops are coming up from the
                                    City every day and we have <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-043-1-086"/> every evidence that
                                    we shall have a forward movement and stirring times before many weeks I hope so as I
                                    am heartily tired of laying around Cities and Camps with little or nothing to do I
                                    want some excitement to Keep life in me think a scout or Picket Guard in face of the
                                    enemy would do me more good than anything else</p>
                        <p>You need not think that I am tired of your letters because you write of business
                                    matters as that is what interests me as much, at this time as anything could- ... I

            <p>Some persons, revered by their friends, are memoralized by the publication of essays or papers
                    written by these friends. A different procedure was adopted in the case of Christopher B. Coleman. A
                    series of his own addresses, twelve in number, was published in memory of his long and faithful
                    devotion to history.</p>
            <p>Both methods have their merits. The latter has one advantage at least; it gives the reader an insight
                    into the mental operations and attitudes of the one being memoralized. Coleman is no exception. This
                    series of addresses constitutes a sort of mental biography of the man.</p>
            <p>In his first address, "The Undying Past," which gives title to the book, we have
                    Coleman's expression of the sense if not of the essence of history. By and large, to every
                    one except the historian, the past is dead and even the poet would bury it. Words, thought Coleman,
                    may be of greater significance than the deeds which they describe. "The right
                    interpretation of events," he said, "may well be of greater importance than the
                    events themselves. …" He deplored that we are more impressed by deeds than by
                    words. Words, to him, as are found in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Address, give expression to ideals which are all too commonly not found in deeds. As a
                    "worker in history" he proposed to preserve the records of both deeds and words,
                    and such records, he insisted, should "reveal an undying past which calls upon the present
                    to be dedicated to high enterprise." Only in this way could the historical record have
                    meaning.</p>
            <p>In his, "The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> Legend," Coleman presented the idea, perhaps, not commonly held, that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> rose to greatness, not in spite of his early environment but because of it. The very
                    meagerness of his opportunities stimulated <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> to take full advantage of those he had. Besides, "The popular <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> legend, which has been reiterated by prominent historians, with its emphasis upon the
                    unfavorable environment of his early years, is a distortion of his life." That environment
                    was a progressive, forward looking one. It <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-043-1-088"/> was that environment
                    plus other factors that made of him "The prophet and the statesman of democratic
                    nationalism. …"</p>
            <p>In his "Rediscovering the Old Northwest," Coleman discussed various conflicting
                    views as to how this great area was acquired by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and what is or should be included in it. He deplored the lack of interest in and
                    knowledge of the history of the area on the part of its citizens. He regretted the absence of any
                    co-operative effort among the five states comprising it toward a common commemoration of its past.
                    To him it comprised a historical unit and he presented a number of arguments to prove his point.
                    Many historical facts, as would be expected, are to be found in this address.</p>
            <p>Coleman did not confine himself to his vocation but in "Life and Letters" turned
                    art and literary critic. Both art and literature, he felt, should portray life. He condemned college
                    authorities for setting up "fusion" courses as a short cut "which left
                    the poor freshmen utterly bewildered." As a bit of intellectual honesty he said:
                    "I did not, when I first read it <hi rend="i">[Education of Henry Adams']</hi>, understand
                    its philosophy of history, nor do I now." Yet he felt that "its devastating
                    criticism of the futilities which most of us accept is tonic for the soul." As a matter of
                    literary history he rejected Carlyle and the Great Man theory of history. "... the progress
                    of the race has come about more largely through unreasoned response to changing conditions than
                    through orderly advances conducted by clear-sighted leaders." He paid his respects to the
                    "power of the written word" yet admitted that it "is … subject
                    to great limitations."</p>
            <p>One fault I find with the book is the fact that the reader must turn to the back to find when and on
                    what occasion each address was delivered. Thus, when the author, in "Traditions of
                    Indiana," says, "Such are the times in which we now find ourselves," one
                    must stop and look up the "Times" referred to. This information might well have
                    been placed at the beginning of each address. This certainly would be more convenient for the
                    reader. To pass to the address itself the author especially listed and emphasized the traditions of
                    worthy heritage, thrift and combative spirit.</p>
            <p>Coleman hit on something pretty solid when in "Morale" he said: "It does
                    not necessarily improve people's morale <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-043-1-089"/> to have the
                    government do things for them. The more that is done for some people, the more they want to have
                    done for them. Some of the clamor for building morale comes near to blackmail. From much of it the
                    inference might be drawn that if the enemy promises to do more than one's own country,
                    persons or groups concerned will transfer their affections." Morale, he felt, was not so
                    superficial or of such sudden achievement but grew out of a people's long struggle upward.
                    This paper is short–so short as to whet one's appetite for more. But maybe such
                    brevity, such whetting is an evidence of art.</p>
            <p>Naturally, as evidence of the position he held, Coleman's chief interest lay in state and
                    local history. In an address dealing with local history he expressed the feeling that history
                    teaching is overemphasized in high school and college, that such teaching is made something of an
                    end in itself and that as a result interest in history does not carry over sufficiently into
                    post-formaUeducation life.</p>
            <p>Without doubt Coleman would be rated as conservative by the liberal. He opposed change for the sake
                    of change. "Changes," he said, "can be overdone .… Changes
                    which ought to be evolutionary, have become revolutionary. … " And
                    "success of the new" which brought "ruin to the old" he felt to
                    be unnecessary. Throughout the addresses he is uniformly and definitely serious, with the exception
                    of "A Change of Subject." Here he displays a delicate sense of humor, probably to
                    be fully appreciated only by persons familiar with literary clubs, before one of which this address
                    was delivered. But even here he was quite serious before he finished. For the moment he cast aside
                    his role of historian, or perhaps deluded himself in believing that he did, for even in "A
                    Change of Subject" there are light touches of history. Coleman was unable to change the
                    subject completely.</p>
            <p>The book closes on a somewhat pessimistic note. In "Action and Reaction" the author
                    was inclined to make life seem rather futile. He demonstrated, by a variety of examples, that man,
                    in his effort to make progress, more or less defeats his own ends. Perhaps every action instituted
                    by man, for good or ill, produces its reaction which will in turn mean both good and ill for
                    society. To cite but one example, the Industrial Revolution has been both a blessing and a curse. It
                    is perhaps impossible to lift the burden from some one's back without placing it on the
                    back of some <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-043-1-090"/> one else. And to consider all possible reactions
                    which may result from any contemplated action "does not necessarily make one a
                    reactionary," Coleman insisted. But he ended on a fairly happy note: "I would be a
                    cheerful pessimist."</p>
            <p>The "Epilogue" is a brief biographical sketch of Coleman, written by Anton
                    Scherrer.</p>
            <p>If a cupped binding is evidence of poor workmanship or cheap material then these faults went into the
                    making of my volume. The printing, however, was well done and on good paper. But regardless of minor
                    defects the little volume will be appreciated by all of Coleman's many friends and will be
                    stimulating reading for any one. It is well worth the price of a dollar.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">New Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>. To those who search out facts, whose full allegiance is reserved for the authenticated
                    document, the book brings its own credentials–complete texts of the major records on
                    which it stands. In fact, for many R. Gerald Mc-Murtry's documentary
                    "appendix," in which he tells of his chance encounter with the Nathaniel Owens
                    plantation some years back and his subsequent interest in Nathaniel's daughter, Mary, who
                    turned down <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and yet managed to escape with only passing mention at the hands of a mass of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> writers–for many the "appendix" will out weigh in interest
                    the body of the story to which it is attached.</p>
            <p>Nor is that fact the fault of Miss Carruthers' sensitively done narrative. Her study, though
                    interpretive and, of necessity, in part imagined, is truthful. The facts are there, many of them.
                    But more important to the atmosphere of credibility which pervades her book is Miss Carruthers'
                    skill in changing her people as circumstances play upon them. <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-043-1-091"/>
                    History determines the route her people shall take, but she reconstructs convincingly (to speak
                    fantastically a moment) the crossing steam of traffic and the changing street lights that help
                    deflect the driver from an appointment already long delayed. It was most interesting to watch the
                    red lights, several of them, play on the romance. Impediment, at first, acted as an impetus, piqued
                    the hero's pride. Its frequent repetition, however, contrasted with the exhilerating
                    currents of activity in Vandalia and strange new life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, made Mary Owens seem "only a nagging bit of unfinished business"
                    which should be consummated one way or the other. Such a metaphor, of course, leads to
                    oversimplification. Miss Carruthers says all that but does not leave her analysis of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Owens relationship with so pat a conclusion.</p>
            <p>A second arresting thing in Miss Carruthers' work is a not infrequent happy harmony between thought
                    and phrase. The ability to find words which do more than expose, which illumine their thought, is a
                    skill satisfying alike to the writer and the reader. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> was possessed by restlessness, Miss Carruthers says. What kind of
                    restlessness? A restlessness "that wouldn't let him set his foot down
                    in one place long enough to make a track." How would it seem to his friends if <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> were to marry? Why, "like hitchin' an eagle to a
                    hand-plow." And after Vandalia, what was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> like? Betrayed by the drying Sangamon River, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> "was a bubble that had burst, and you couldn't pick up the vapor in
                    your hands and make a bubble out of it again." As for his friends?
                    They'd all be going soon. "Nothing here. Nothing but his youth, his long lazy
                    dreams .… Dead youth, dead dreams, dead town. And you couldn't sit up with a
                    corpse forever."</p>
            <p>So much for the story. What of its foundation? Is it built on memories some thirty-one
                    years old and buttressed with conjecture?</p>
            <p>In his appendix McMurtry prints the complete texts of seven letters written by the two people most
                    able to speak with authority on the romance, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s letters to Mary, three of them, his single eccentric epistle to Mrs. 0. H.
                    Browning, and Mrs. Mary Owens Vineyard's three replies to William Herndon's
                    questionnaires. Those documents, with the one curious exception, tell a straight forward, consistent
                    story of the relationship.</p>
            <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-043-1-092"/>
            <p>That one exception, however, so tantalized the reviewer during the first reading of <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        </placeName>'s Other Mary</hi> that she caught herself fairly peeking behind pages to
                    find some reference to it. There was none. "By what right," she asked herself,
                    "does a thorough biography of Mary Owens leave out evidence, primary evidence, in the case.
                    What if it does conflict? It exists and therefore ought to appear." Appear it
                    does with bibliographical and explanatory notes–in the appendix.</p>
            <p>Miss Carruthers, no doubt, felt that an April Fool's Day missive describing with gross
                    exaggeration and clumsy sarcasm the woman who rejected his repeated offers of marriage could add
                    little to a serious appreciation of the rejected Abe <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She may have believed, too, that there would be many Isaac Arnolds and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hays among her readers who would be repulsed by it, as they were, and made defenseless,
                    while wishing to defend, their hero from charges of unkindness, insincerity and pathetically poor
                    taste. My own feeling is that Miss Carruthers could have used it with great effect. It could have
                    lent a, freshness and an unexpected twist–the sight of that letter being
                    written– as a period of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> despondency began to lift into part bitter, part blue, part gay self-satisfaction and
                    adequacy. That he meant it to entertain the Brownings and their circle only, she would have made
                    clear. His earnest request years later in the White House that it not be made public as long as any
                    of the principals were alive to be hurt by it, she could have given in one of her delightful scenes
                    just preceding the "Epilogue, Spring 1866." Miss Carruthers could have handled it
                    admirably, given her readers the feeling, if not the words, of the Herndon appraisal plus her own
                    broad and sympathetic insight into the vagaries of passing human moods and emotions. That she did
                    not choose to do so gave her story a lyrical ending (one completely in harmony with the book as a
                    whole) but reserved to the appendix one of the dramatic high spots of the tale.</p>
            <p>What else does the appendix hold? Of no slight use to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> enthusiast is the running list of printed accounts of the Owens-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> story. In the course of his four-year search, McMurtry found and recorded outstanding
                    articles in magazines and newspapers as well as pamphlets and chapters of books. A number of the
                    best and most curious of <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-043-1-093"/> these with a few words of evaluation
                    each appear in some one and a half pages.</p>
            <p>Almost immediately thereafter comes an account of William Herndon's successful investigation
                    of the Owens romance. About a year after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s death, Mrs. Mary Owens Vineyard heard from the would-be biographer. In
                    response to his inquiries, she sent him her three letters from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> (to be copied and returned) filled out a questionnaire on the whole affair, corrected a
                    rumor, and added two anecdotes to his fund of information.</p>
            <p>Following Herndon's analysis of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> letters which McMurtry quotes in some detail, are printed excerpts from two letters on
                    the romance written to Jesse W. Weik by Benjamin Vineyard, Mary Owens' son.</p>
            <p>And finally there is an account of the bringing to light by Lamon of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Browning letter, mentioned above. The distress it produced in the thinking of some of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s admirers, the various efforts at defense and explanation culminating in
                    Herndon's earnest, thoughtful attempt to interpret it, and a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> who could have written it, to himself and his readers–all are there. The
                    story of the documents themselves, then, including the present location of all the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and some of the others, that is the appendix.</p>
            <p>There is one last question that must engage our attention for a moment. If Herndon and Lamon knew the
                    facts and others since their time have utilized them, why <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        </placeName>'s Other Mary?</hi> Before permitting McMurtry to answer in his
                    own defense, what can the reviewer say? Occasionally in its appearance in the earlier
                    works there have been minor mistakes, Mary cited as being in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, for example, when actually she was again with her sister in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>. McMurtry's research, moreover, has added details to the life of Mary Owens
                    which the earlier biographers did not know. In the second place, <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        </placeName>'s Other Mary</hi> is to all the other accounts read by this reviewer what
                    the scene, in its effect of reader participation, always is to the narrative second-hand report.
                    Here we are not told that Mary became angry when Abe failed to carry Mrs. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bowling Green</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s baby up the hill. Here we see them all climbing, Abe talking of a county
                    road, curbing his long stride to match the women walking, clumsily helping Mary, waiting patiently
                    while Mrs. Green stops for breath and shifts her heavy baby from one arm to <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-043-1-094"/> the other, and at last Mary's slowly growing irritation
                    flaring to spoil the day for both of them. The scene type with its conversation and details is
                    fictionized history? Yes, but with the appendix telling the reader exactly where to draw
                    the line between the real and the imagined only good is done. McMurtry's added information
                    and the entire tale unfolded panorama-like through some one hundred and ninety pages, those two
                    things should earn for the book a hearing.</p>
            <p>But McMurtry has other reasons. "A complete account of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Owens romance," he tells us, "with all the significant letters and
                    documents pertaining to the affair, along with biographical data on Mary Owens, has not yet been
                    collected in book form .… The real value of this study is that both the casual reader and
                    the exacting student can more fully analyze and understand <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> during that important period of his life when he was groping about trying to find
                    himself. We hope," he continues, "that this study will also give a new portrait of
                    a woman who had all the qualities of a Todd, who saw in him just as much as Mary Todd saw, but who
                    voluntarily declined the road to honor and glory because he was 'deficient in those little
                    links which make up the chain of a woman's happiness.' "</p>

                    </placeName> frontier and a short period in which he lectured, sold books, and wrote for magazines
                    paved the way for his connection with the editorship of the <hi rend="i">Independent.</hi> He
                    developed his literary ability while in this position and while editor of the <hi rend="i">Hearth
                        and Home.</hi> The appearance of his serial story, "The Hoosier School
                    Master," marked the beginning of his literary career. It was followed by <hi rend="i">The
                        End of the World, The Mystery of Metropolisville, The Circuit Rider, The Graystons</hi>, and
                    other novels, short stories, and <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-043-1-095"/> articles. An interlude in his
                    literary work was his three-year ministry at the "creedless" church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName>, although he did not give up writing entirely. Eggleston's life was almost a
                    constant struggle with his early religious convictions and his sense of duty.</p>
            <p>Having failed to find satisfaction in a liberal ministry, ned, after a vacation, to research and
                    writing in the history of American life. Here was a field which held his interest for the remainder
                    of his life. His first volume of social history was published in 1896 as <hi rend="i">The Beginners
                        of a Nation, A History of the Source and Rise of the Earliest English Settlements in America
                        with Special Reference to the Life and Character of the People.</hi> In recognition of his
                    writing, particularly on historical subjects, he was elected president of the American Historical
                    Association. His presidential address was entitled "The New History." A second
                    volume, <hi rend="i">The Transit of Civilization from <placeName>
                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
                        </placeName> to America in the Seventeenth Century</hi> had only recently appeared. The vision
                    expressed in his presidential address was at best very imperfectly embodied in these two volumes and
                    particularly the latter. He should be known, however, for his historical work because his
                    contribution to history may prove to be more significant than to the novel.</p>
            <p>The real story about Eggleston is Eggleston, not his poetry, his novels, his short stories, his
                    preaching, his lectures, or his history. Could he have received historical training in his early
                    life and have devoted his mature years to historical writing, he might have been a great historian.
                    As it was, he revealed his elements of greatness in struggling against bad health, and prejudices
                    early acquired, until he found his way by a circuitous route to a great vision. But old age and poor
                    health closed upon him and the embodiment of his vision remained for others to accomplish. He was
                    not a great novelist or a great historian, merely a man who struggled upward against great odds.</p>
            <p>The physical characteristics of this volume are rather poor. The binding would endure very little use
                    if English or History classes were given assignments in it. It is unfortunate that war conditions
                    deprived it of a sturdier physique.</p>
            <p>The author has prepared an extensive bibliography of Eggleston's papers, letters, and
                    manuscripts, and of his published writings, which will be of value especially to scholars. <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-043-1-096"/> Errors of fact seem to be at a minimum and the author is to be
                    commended for a very useful study.</p>

                    of the Jackson-ian administration. It contains documents illustrating the removal of the Indians,
                    the development of internal improvements, and the effect of the frontier on the character of
                    American democracy. It is concerned with the years 1829–1837, when the great outpouring
                    of New Englanders into the Great Lakes region assumed such large proportions. It contains more than
                    twelve hundred pages of material. The same careful selection of representative and significant
                    documents, and the scholarly work in editing with ample footnotes, containing references to
                    additional material, which have become standard to the series, marks this volume.</p>
