					<p>The History of the Church is a record of the mercies of God on the human family.
						Considered in this light, the view that history is self-glorification is narrow in the
						extreme, and lacks the Christian instinct referring all things to God. The same holds
						good, be it the history of the Church in general, or of any portion of it. The purpose
						always is the glory of God and the salvation of souls. Such is the issue, and not the
						individual, not the missionary, not the priest; and therefor the Church records should
						be kept accurately and not withheld from publication. Gratitude prompts us to thank and
						glorify the Giver on High.</p>

					<p>Sublime doctrines replenish the priest's mind, heaven-born aspirations exhilarate his
						heart, the salvation of others fires his soul with charity; but the example of holy
						priests, zealous, apostolic laborers in the Lord's vineyard stimulates him to renewed
						and enduring activity. To study these men, how they lived, labored, suffered and died,
						will foster within him the heroic spirit of these grand characters. The laity is
						similarly affected, when they read how the laity, not more than two generations ago,
						brought exacting sacrifices, underwent severe hardships of travel in heat and cold, for
						miles and miles, over almost impassable roads, without breaking their fast, to confess,
						and to receive, and to assist at the Holy Sacrifice, and once more to hear the word of
						God preached to them. The Catholic of the twentieth century can appreciate the changed
						conditions only, by learning how the parishes, now prosperous and flourishing, were
						organized; how the church-buildings developed from the rude frame or log structure to
						the magnificent edifices of today; what hardships and sufferings, even the little ones
						had to undergo, to receive a Christian education. And the lives of hundreds of priests
						and thousands of noble lay-men will more than compensate for the scandalous conduct of a
						few.</p>

					<p>These and similar considerations suggested the usefulness of the present work, and
						prompted its publication. It is a <pb id="VAB8203-006" n="6"/> plain statement of facts
						made on reliable authority. Its defects are glaring, for the reason that hardly in a
						single instance all the information that was wanted, could be obtained. No effort was
						made to conceal these defects beneath glowing verbiage and glittering generalities. The
						priests, the religious and several of the laity of the diocese have made this history
						possible by freely giving their assistance. Without the assistance of Rev. Wm. C.
						Miller, who spent nearly one year on it, the history would not have been undertaken. He
						is deserving the full credit, and the gratitude of all who appreciate what has been
						accomplished in preserving these records of the diocese. The reader is requested to note
						the defects whether of commission or omission and communicate the same to us for future
						use.</p>

					<p>This history has been in preparation since December 18, 1905, when the following
						circular was sent to the priests of the diocese, with the request that the historical
						data be furnished within six months:</p>

					<p>
						<q>
							<p>A. The history of your place before it had a church. If the name of the place was
								changed at any time, give the change or changes. Record the visits of the earliest
								missionaries to your place or district. When did it become a STATION, that is to say
								a place without a church, regularly visited? Who were these visiting priests? Where
								did they reside? Give some interesting particulars of this period. Were there any
								note-worthy lay-men? What was the number of souls at this time? What was the
								complexion of the Catholic population as to nationality?</p>
							<p>"B. The history of your place when it became a MISSION, that is to say, when it
								became a place with a church regularly attended. What priests had charge of it
								during this time? Where did they reside? In each case, if possible, give the year,
								month and day when they took charge and when they ceased to have charge of the
								mission. When was the first church built? Describe this church. Who was the priest
								in charge at the time of the building of the church? What was its cost? How was the
								money raised? Give interesting particulars of this period. Were there any
								note-worthy lay-men, with <pb id="VAB8203-007" n="7"/> reference especially, to the
								founders of the parish? What was the number of souls at this time?</p>
							<p>"C. The history of your parish: 1. The church grounds. How much ground has the
								church? When was the ground acquired? Was it secured at one time or different times?
								What was the cost? What priest or priests had charge at the time of these purchases?
								Where did these priests reside? 2. The church. When was it built? Who was the priest
								at the time? Describe the church, the style of architecture, the decorations, the
								furniture, etc. How much did it all cost? How was the money raised? Have
								improvements been made on the church since its erection? What were they? When were
								they made? What did they cost? Who was the priest at the time? What is the seating
								capacity of the church? If the present church is not the first church, then give the
								history of the former church or churches. 3. The school. When was it built? Who was
								the pastor at the time? Give the dimensions of the building. Its capacity for school
								purposes. How much did it cost? How was the money raised? Have improvements been
								made since? What were they? When were they made? At what cost? Who was the pastor?
								4. The teachers. Who teaches the school? Are the teachers male or female? Are they
								lay or religious? If religious, of what community? How many teachers? What grades
								are taught? Is there a high school or academy? How is the school supported? What is
								the attendance at school? Where do the teachers reside? If in a house specially for
								them, when was this house built? What did it cost? Who was pastor? What improvements
								since? When made? At what cost? Under what pastor? 5. The priest's house. When was
								it built? Who was the priest in charge? What was the cost? Have improvements been
								made since? Is the present house the first? If not then give the facts, dates, etc.,
								concerning the former house or houses. 6. If your church property has still other
								church buildings, mention them, giving full information concerning the time of their
								erection, their cost, their purpose, their improvements, etc., as suggested by the
								above questions. 7. Give an account of the cemetery, its area, its cost, and other
								facts. 8. What is the estimated value of your entire church property? What is the
								amount of debt on the same? <pb id="VAB8203-008" n="8"/> 9. Name the various
								societies in your parish. Give the dates of their organization, their membership,
								their purpose, the good accomplished, and so forth. 10. What is the number of
								families and the number of souls in your charge? 11. Mention any remarkable or
								extraordinary events in the history of your parish. 12. How many boys of your parish
								have become priests or have entered religious communities? How many girls have
								become sisters? 13. What lay-men have done your parish note-worthy services? What
								were these services?</p>
							<p>"D. Missions and Stations. If you have charge of any Missions or Stations in
								addition to the church of which you are the resident pastor, then give information
								concerning each of them, such as is suggested by the foregoing questions.</p>
							<p>"E. The priests. Give a complete list of the priests who served the Catholic people
								of your place or of your district in the early missionary days, and of priests who
								visited your place when it was a station, and of priests who attended the same when
								it became a mission, and of the priests who became the resident pastors. Give the
								dates on which their labors began and ended. It would be an act deserving special
								commendation, if a brief biographical sketch of each of these priests were given. If
								your parish has or has had assistant priests the names, dates, and brief biography
								of them is wanted.</p>
							<p>"F. Above all, give your own biography."</p>

					<p>Indiana furnishes an excellent theme for history. The little French colony on its soil
						grew around the forts, thrown up by France as outposts, to protect the Illinois country
						and the Mississippi. The more exposed lines, extending from Niagara to Fort Duquesne,
						were simply military posts, around which scarcely a sign of settlement arose.</p>

					<p>The pioneer of the valley of the Wabash was, in all probability, Robert Cavalier, Sieur
						de LaSalle. Doubt has long hung over his earlier explorations, about the year 1670; but
						the studies of our best antiquarian topographer, General John S. Clark, of Auburn,
						embracing every known document and map bearing on the point, leave little doubt that,
						about 1670, LaSalle passed from Lake Erie up the Maumee, crossed to the Wabash, and
						descended it till he became discouraged, and his men deserted. He was seeking the great
						river, called by the Iroquois, Ohio, and by the Western Algonquin tribes, the
						Mississippi. Marquette subsequently passed the mouth of the Ohio, which he called by its
						Algonquin name, Ouabouskigou, the origin of our Wabash. There is no trace, in the
						"Jesuit Relations," which were printed down to 1672, of any knowledge of the Wabash
						river, or the shores of Lake Erie. The "Relations," prepared for the ensuing years to
						1679, which I printed from the old manuscripts, in all that they say of missionaries
						employed in the West, make it evident that no Jesuit ever reached the Wabash, before
						1680. The early maps of Joliet, their friend, and the companion of Marquette, do not
						indicate it.</p>

					<p>Marquette and Allouez reached the Illinois villages by the way of the Chicago river and
						the Desplaines; and the Recollects with LaSalle did so by the way of the St. Joseph's.

						<pb id="VAB8203-010" n="10"/> LaSalle's personal occupation of the Illinois country,
						Father Allouez kept aloof, as the great explorer was bitterly hostile to the Jesuits:
						but after he went back to France, the missionary was welcomed at the fort, in the
						Illinois country, by Chevalier Tonti. He subsequently founded a mission on the St.
						Joseph's, where wandering Miamis and Pottawottamies had gathered from Green Bay, in
						which district he had long ministered to them and the Maskoutens. The Marquis de
						Denonville, on the 1st of October, 1686, granted to Father Claude Dablon, Superior of
						the Jesuit Missions in Canada, a tract of land, twenty arpents in front on the St.
						Joseph's River and of equal depth, at such point as he might select, for a chapel and
						residence. A modest chapel and mission house rose twenty-five leagues from the mouth of
						the river, and here Father Claude Allouez died, August 27-8, 1689, and his remains, not
						improbably, repose within the limits of Indiana. Fathers Aveneau, Gravier and Chardon
						continued the St. Joseph's Mission, till hostility between the French and the Miamis
						prevented their labors for a time.</p>

					<p>In 1719 Fort Ouiatenon grew up among the Ouiatenons or Weas, another Miami tribe on the
						north bank of the Wabash, below the present Lafayette. Father Mermet had been their
						missionary, and may have labored here. Then Fort Miami was established where Fort Wayne
						now stands and finally, in 1733, the Poste au Ouabache, which soon took the name of its
						active commandant, a Canadian gentleman, John Babtiste Bissot, called from a seigneury
						he owned in Canada, Sieur de Vincennes. He had long been active in Western affairs, was
						brother-in-law to Louis Joliet, the discoverer of the Mississippi, and died nobly in an
						unfortunate campaign against the Chickasaws.</p>

					<p>A chapel, dedicated to St. Francis Xavier, was erected at this last post, and there
						seems to have been chapels at Fort Miami and at Fort Ouiatenon. On the 22nd of July,
						1741, a child was born at the last of these, who received in baptism the name of Anthony
						Foucher. This boy was destined to be the first native of the Wabash Valley, or indeed of
						the Western country, who was raised to the priest-hood. He was ordained by the Bishop of
						Quebec, October 30, 1774, and before he died, in 1812, a Bishop, from the Southern bank
						of the Ohio, was <pb id="VAB8203-011" n="11"/> reviving the Faith among his countrymen
						on the river of his birth.</p>

					<p>Our reverend historian of the diocese of Vincennes then takes up the earliest Register
						of Vincennes, opening April 21, 1749, with the marriage of Julian Trottier to Josette
						Marie. The officiating clergyman was the Jesuit Father, Sebastian Louis Meurin,'who
						continued the labors of Allouez and Mermet.</p>

					<p>Stirring times of wars with England had come, and the little posts at Vincennes,
						Ouiatenon, Kaskaskia, St. Joseph's, Prairie du Rocher were filled with tidings of battle
						and expedition. The Jesuit Fathers, Vivier, Lamorinie, Poitier, DuJaunay, all labored
						among the French and Indians of Indiana, and the line of these pioneer priests of the
						Society closes with Father Julian Duvernay, who officiated at the chapel of St. Francis
						Xavier till 1763.</p>

					<p>Then the flag of France was lowered at all the French posts in the West, and English
						soldiers came to plant, amid these French hamlets and their Indian friends, the flag of
						England. It was regarded with sullen discontent, and when Pontiac proposed to the Indian
						tribes a general rising, almost all the English forts were captured and destroyed
						simultaneously. Among them perished Fort Ouiatenon.</p>

					<p>Of the state of religion, among these little communities of Catholics in the far West,
						we know but what can be gleaned from the parish registers and from lists that have been
						preserved of those who made their Easter duty; there is very rare evidence of
						immorality; the colonists married young, and if jovial, light-hearted and daring, more
						given to hunt and Indian trade, than to patient tilling of the soil, they led moral
						lives, were tolerably regular in their devotions, and the little communities have no
						criminal record, no prisons, no deaths by violence, no executions. Each little
						settlement had its notary, and he or some other of the better educated read the
						mass-prayers, and catechized the children, when no priest was there to offer the Holy
						Sacrifice. At this time there were some eighty or ninety families at Vincennes, fourteen
						at Ouiatenon and nine or ten at the junction of the St. Joseph's and St. Mary's.</p>

					<p>The infidel council at New Orleans, in 1762, ordered all Jesuit chapels to be razed,
						and one in Illinois, though on <pb id="VAB8203-012" n="12"/> English soil, was actually
						destroyed. When the English commanders came, the Catholics of Indiana felt despondent.
						The fate of the Acadians, who, born and brought up under the English flag, had been
						deprived of their homes and all they possessed, and had been torn from their native land
						to be flung as paupers along the Atlantic coast, was before them. A similar fate might
						be theirs. On the 30th of December, 1764, a new era seemed to dawn, when Gen. Gage
						announced in a proclamation, that the King of England granted to his new Catholic
						subjects in the Illinois' country, liberty to enjoy their religion undisturbed.</p>

					<p>The people at Vincennes then sought to obtain a priest; but the Bishop of Quebec, cut
						off from supply of clergymen from France, deprived of the Jesuits and Recollects, who
						were doomed to extinction, could not find priests to fill nearer pressing wants. It was
						not till 1769, that the Rev. Peter Gibault reached the Illinois country. At Vincennes,
						and the adjoining missions, there were some 800 souls. They received the priest with
						joy; marriages were solemnized, the children, privately baptized were christened with
						due ceremonies. The Mission was one to attract him, with its orchard and gardens, but
						his field of labor included also the Missions in Illinois, and his visits to Vincennes
						were made at stated intervals.</p>

					<p>In 1772, the little Catholic community in the Wabash valley were startled by an order
						of Gen. Gage, which seemed to prelude a new Acadian outrage. They were all commanded to
						leave the settlements; when they protested against the cruel order, he demanded the
						title deeds of the lands they held. It was evident, that it was the purpose to drive the
						Catholic settlers from British soil, doubtless to gratify the bitter anti-catholic
						feeling in the English colonies at the East.</p>

					<p>But the Parliament of Great Britain, on the 2nd of June, 1774, passed a law which
						precipitated the American Revolution, by arousing all the bigotry of the colonies. This
						was the "Quebec Act," by which the people of Canada were permitted to retain their
						French laws and customs, and the Catholic Church was maintained in all its rights. The
						French settlements at the West, in our present Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and
						Wisconsin, were by the act included in the province of Quebec. The Church there was thus
						formally recognized <pb id="VAB8203-013" n="13"/> by the English Government,. and the
						right of the Bishop of Quebec to appoint priests, of the priests to receive tithes, was
						guaranteed by law. The oath of allegiance required to be taken was such, as Catholics
						could lawfully take, not such a one as was tendered to the Acadians, who were condemned
						as Popish Recusants.</p>

					<p>This guarantee of religious freedom filled the Catholics on the Detroit, the Wabash,
						the Illinois and Mississippi with joy; but by the people of the English colonies, it was
						regarded in the light of a grievous and bitter wrong. It is denounced in our Declaration
						of Independence as an act of pretended legislation <q>"for abolishing the free system of
							English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government,
							and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and a fit
							instrument, for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies."</q> I cannot
						find that in the legislation or judicial decisions of those Western States, this act has
						ever been recognized as having been in force, but it certainly was at least till July 4,
						1776, when the severing of all allegiance to England may have modified the condition of
						affairs; but this is a question for constitutional lawyers to decide.</p>

					<p>When the Revolution broke out, the English Government, which had appointed Indian
						agents, controlled the various tribes of red men, and used them against the thirteen
						States; and it became important to destroy this influence. The Continental Congress had
						no resources, but Virginia claimed the country, northwest of the Ohio, as part of her
						territory. In the summer of 1778, an expedition from Virginia, under Colonel George R.
						Clark appeared before Kaskaskia, after a brave and hardy march. The French settlers and
						their priest, Rev. Peter Gibault, received him without opposition; and Clark, by the aid
						of this clergyman and of Colonel Vigo, a Spanish settler there, reduced Vincennes,
						capturing the British commandant. Indiana thus became part of Virginia, and came within
						the sway of Congress. The people took the oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth of
						Virginia, and its laws were extended over all the territory.</p>

					<p>Virginia had been fiercely anti-Catholic; its colonial statute book teems with penal
						laws against the Catholics, and one may <pb id="VAB8203-014" n="14"/> be cited as a
						sample, which put the testimony of a Catholic on a par with that of a negro slave,
						something not to be received in a court of justice. In Virginia a man might with
						impunity kill another in presence of a Catholic or a slave.</p>

					<p>This old spirit soon showed itself; for shortly after the temporary Government was
						organized by Colonel Todd, the French settlers were, as under Gage, summoned to produce
						the titles by which they held their lands. Yet, amid the uneasiness produced by this
						hostile act, the Catholic settlers did not waver in their new allegiance, but bore their
						part in the struggle. In the autumn of 1780, LaBalme, with a party including many from
						Vincennes, captured the British post, Kekionga, on the Maumee, and died bravely soon
						after, over-powered by numbers, at the River a-Boite.</p>

					<p>In 1781, Virginia relinquished to Congress the territory northwest of the Ohio, and the
						deed confirmed the French titles, including those of the churches in Indiana, Illinois
						and Michigan.</p>

					<p>The course pursued by the Rev. Peter Gibault, cut him off from all aid or recognition
						in Canada, so that he had to struggle on alone, reduced with his people to great penury,
						by their sacrifices for the national cause. During the long interval from 1779 to 1784,
						he was unable to visit Vincennes. He came at last with Rev. Payet, and revived religion
						once more. The next year he took up his abode at Vincennes, built a new log church,
						ninety feet long by forty-two broad, the old church being remodeled for his residence.
						Here he remained till the 11th of October, 1789.</p>

					<p>Meanwhile, the treaty of Paris, in 1783, had recognized the independence of the United
						States, with its territory extending to the eastern bank of the Mississippi; and the
						clergy in Maryland and Pennsylvania, who had at first, from fear of offending Protestant
						prejudice against Bishops, deprecated the appointment of one, had solicited that a
						Bishop should be placed over them. Pope Pius the Sixth, in 1784, appointed the Rev. John
						Carroll, Prefect Apostolic; but the pastor at Vincennes was a stranger amid the clergy
						in the United States, while he was under the ban in Canada, where the Bishop had
						excommunicated all who joined the Americans, and still refused the sacraments to all,
						who had not remained faithful to the <pb id="VAB8203-015" n="15"/> British cause. Yet,
						the northwest territory was still part of the Diocese of Quebec, although the Bishop
						exercised no jurisdiction. This unfortunate condition of affairs lasted, till the
						erection of the See of Baltimore by Pope Pius VI., November 6, 1789, when in express
						terms he directed <q>"all the clergy and people dwelling in the aforesaid United States
							of America, though hitherto they may have been subject to other Bishops of other
							dioceses, to be henceforward subject to the Bishop of Baltimore."</q> The Bishop of
						Quebec, though protesting pro forma against a division of his diocese without his
						knowledge, gladly relinquished all claim and jurisdiction over a district, whose
						spiritual wants he had neither inclination nor power to supply.</p>

					<p>Down to this period, the territory of the subsequently erected diocese of Vincennes was
						under the ecclesiastical law of France, as held in Canada. The priest received his
						tithes, the decrees of the Council of Trent were regarded as published as much as in
						Canada-- the same holy days of obligation and fast days were observed as on the banks of
						the St. Lawrence.</p>

					<p>The diocese of Baltimore, as established by the Holy See, included the whole territory
						then belonging to the United States, and recognized by the treaty of Paris, in 1783. Its
						Western limit was the Mississippi; Florida with the Gulf shore, Louisiana, and all the
						territory west of the Mississippi, were in the hands of Spain; over it the Archbishop of
						Santiago de Cuba had, since 1776, extended his ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and through
						a Bishop Auxiliary he was endeavoring to bring in the discipline of the Church.</p>

					<p>Bishop Carroll with few priests, no seminary, no institutions of any kind, found
						himself unable to meet the calls, that came from all parts of the vast country, confided
						to him. Natchez was visited by the Spanish ecclesiastics of New Orleans; but the
						Northwest was destitute of priests.</p>

					<p>That district had another difficulty. The bigotry of John Jay, in 1775, prevented
						Canada from joining the thirteen, colonies; the same feeling made him, in 1786, an
						indifferent diplomatist, when Franklin was willing to make any concession to induce
						England to yield it to us. England retained Canada not only, but for years maintained
						her military possession of Detroit, and her influence over the Indian tribes of the
						West, <pb id="VAB8203-016" n="16"/> whom she incited to hostility against the Americans.
						The Catholics of the North-West were true; living from infancy in intimate relations
						with the various nations, they knew their language, their disposition, their ideas. But
						for their aid as agents, interpreters, deputies, the United States Government would have
						been powerless in the West.</p>

					<p>But the want of priests was felt by all. The storm of the French revolution sent, at
						the opportune moment, a number of learned, zealous priests to this country. One of
						these, the Rev. Benedict Joseph Flaget, was sent by Bishop Carroll to Vincennes soon
						after his arrival, in 1792. Travel was slow and difficult. It took twenty days to reach
						Pittsburg from Philadelphia; and to reach Vincennes was often a matter of months. The
						good priest arrived at his ruinous log chapel, in season to celebrate Mass at Christmas,
						after restoring the tottering altar, and giving the church such renovation and
						decoration as time and means permitted. There was a community of 700, but in the long
						period when no priest was there, so great had indifference grown, that only twelve
						approached the Sacraments, at the great Solemnity. He went to work, however, with the
						zeal which characterized him through his long Apostolic career, and was consoled with
						seeing that the majority became communicants, just reversing the numbers that shocked
						him on his arrival. He opened a school, encouraged industry, thrift and charity. The
						neighboring Indians also received his care, and his labors during the ravages of the
						small-pox completely prostrated him. Having been recalled to Baltimore, he left
						Vincennes in the spring of 1795.</p>

					<p>To replace him, Bishop Carroll sent the Rev. John Francis Rivet, who had arrived from
						Spain in December, 1794. Washington had seen the happy influence of Father Flaget over
						the Indians, and wished a priest to aid the Government in carrying out a beneficent
						policy, which would tend to their civilization, and who would teach them the advantages
						of the Christian religion. Father Rivet's offer of his services was accepted; he was
						directed to establish himself on the Wabash, and a salary allotted to him. Though the
						Government long neglected to pay this sum, needed for his support, Father Rivet, says
						Bishop Carroll, <q>"applies himself incessantly in fulfilling the objects of his
							appointment, and disposing the Indians to <pb id="VAB8203-017" n="17"/> maintain a
							friendly temper towards the United States. He is indefatigable in instructing them in
							the principles of Christianity, and not without success."</q> The historian of the
						diocese of Vincennes shows, from the records, to how many different tribes his zealous
						care extended. By any one who remembers, how those Indians, under English influence,
						made war on this country, defeated St. Clair and Harman, and yielded to Gen. Wayne only
						after a stubborn fight, the service done the country by the Catholic priests and people
						can be estimated. The English Government knew and felt Father Rivet's power, and a
						priest from Canada, a future bishop of Halifax, was sent to employ his influence with
						the Indians, to induce them to make no alliance with the Americans.</p>

					<p>Rev. John Francis Rivet became Vicar General in the West, in 1798, and continued his
						labors till he sank under them, in 1804. Vincennes was then for years without a settled
						pastor; visited at intervals by Rev. Donatian Olivier from Illinois, and by Revs. Baden
						and Nerinckx from Kentucky.</p>

					<p>When the See of Bardstown was erected, the people of Vincennes applied to their old
						pastor, the newly consecrated Bishop of Bardstown, for a priest. He visited them himself
						in 1814, and, with Rev. D. Olivier, remained some time in instructing the people so long
						neglected, and for the first time administered the Sacrament of Confirmation in Indiana.
						He visited them again and again, as missionary and as Bishop, but it was not until 1818,
						that Vincennes received a pastor, in the person of the Rev. Anthony Blanc, who, during a
						two years' incumbency, not only revived faith at Vincennes, but built two log chapels,
						one at seven miles and the other at twelve miles distance. Two other priests assisted
						him at intervals. He was succeeded by Revs. Dahman and Champourier.</p>

					<p>The Catholic Almanac of 1822 thus briefly gives its account of the Church in three
						States, which now form eight dioceses, presided over by two Archbishops and six Bishops;
							<q>"the states of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois are daily adding more and more to the
							Church. In each of these, several large congregations of Catholics are found. They are
							chiefly French, who extended themselves through parts of this country as early as the
							17th century. Vincennes, in Indiana, was formerly a station of the Jesuits, whence
							they made excursions among the savage tribes."</q></p>

					<pb id="VAB8203-018" n="18"/>

					<p>Father Champourier, sent there in May, 1823, describes the Church in Vincennes as so
							<q>"nearly rotten and out of repair, that at any little storm it becomes very
							dangerous to stay in it. Moreover, it is open to every wind and penetrated by every
							drop of rain,"</q> and he appealed in the papers to the Catholics of the country, for
						aid in the erecting a more suitable church. He was the only resident pastor, with a
						whole State, and even more, for his parish.</p>

					<p>When Bishop Flaget visited Indiana 1829, he found Catholics at New Albany, the Knobs,
						Black Oak Ridge and Washington. The jubilee granted by Pope Leo XII was proclaimed; Mass
						was offered at all these stations, instructions given, marriages and baptisms performed,
						or revalidated.</p>

					<p>A new Catholicity was thus growing up around the old cradle of the faith at Vincennes.
						So promising did the future seem, that Bishop Flaget met Bishop Rosati, of St. Louis, at
						Vincennes in 1832, and after examining the condition of affairs and the prospect of an
						increase by immigration, these two great Bishops resolved, to address the Holy See and
						solicit the erection of Indiana into a diocese, with the See at Vincennes, and for the
						mitre they agreed to propose the President of Mt. St. Mary's College, the Rev. Simon
						Gabriel Brute.</p>

					<p>The first of our present series of Catholic Almanacs, that published in 1833, gives its
						account of Indiana so briefly, that we may be allowed to copy it in full: <q>"Black Oak
							Ridge, Davies County, Rev. Simon Lalumiere. Mount Pleasant, occasionally. Vincennes,
							693 m. from Washington. Rev. L. Picot."</q> This was all the actual material for the
						new diocese.</p>

					<p>One of these, apparently the Ven. Father Lalumiere, himself a native of the State, in
						the spring of 1833 said Mass for the four or five Catholic families of Columbus, and
						preached in the Court House; then said Mass at Shelby for ten Catholic families. At St.
						Peter's, in Daviess County, the Sisters of Charity, it would seem, had opened a school,
						and he began to talk of a church at Washington, Indiana, and the Bishop who was
						expected. <q>"The Catholic population of Indiana is greater than would readily be
							supposed, and is constantly and rapidly increasing,"</q> he adds.</p>

					<p>There seemed to be no very encouraging field for a Bishop, but the Rev. Dr. Brute
						resigned his position at Emmitsburg, <pb id="VAB8203-019" n="19"/> for which he was so
						well fitted, and where as professor and president he had produced an indelible
						impression on the young levites, confided to his care. At the call of his Superiors and
						yielding to the judgment of those whom he respected, he assumed the arduous duty of
						building up a new diocese. He had seen the struggles and difficulties of others, and had
						no unfounded hopes.</p>

					<p>The diocese of Vincennes as established by the Holy See, in 1834, included the State of
						Indiana, and also about a third of Illinois. Having accepted the Bulls, he made a
						retreat at Bardstown, and was consecrated in the cathedral of St. Louis, October 28,
						1834, by Bishop Flaget, assisted by Bishops Rosati and Purcell. He was welcomed with joy
						at Vincennes, and took possession of his little brick cathedral and his palace, which
						was a one story building, measuring twenty-five feet by twelve. He had in his diocese
						two priests in Indiana, Revs. Lalumiere and Ferneding, the latter the pioneer priest of
						the German settlers, and one in Illinois, Rev. J. M. J. St. Cyr, then at Chicago. There
						was, besides, Rev. Badin's Mission at South Bend, with the Sisters and an Indian
						school.</p>

					<p>He made a visitation of his diocese, to discover where there were Catholics to be
						attended, at what points churches could be established and maintained. Then, with some
						definite idea of the wants of the diocese, he went to Europe to solicit aid for the
						flock of all nations gathered in Indiana, old French settlers to the "manner born,"
						Americans from Maryland and Kentucky, Irish and Germans. In Europe he procured material
						aid, and appealed to his Breton countrymen for priests to aid him. The men of St.
						Patrick's race did not turn a deaf ear to the call; priests came, of sterling qualities,
						who made Indiana the field of their long and untiring labor. How the Bishop, after his
						return, devoted himself to his duties as bishop and missionary, our reverend author
						tells most touchingly. His short career one of constant visitation, closed in June,
						1839, in a calm and holy death, fit crown for such a life.</p>

					<p>The Rev. Celestine de la Hailandiere, one of the Breton priests who came to Bishop
						Brute's aid in 1836, had been appointed coadjutor, and became the second bishop of
						Vincennes. He was in Europe, at the time of Bishop Brute's death, and began his labors
						for his diocese by sending over priests, <pb id="VAB8203-020" n="020"/> vestments,
						sacred vessels. He induced the Eudists to undertake a theological seminary at Vincennes,
						Father Sorin, of the Holy Cross, to begin the work at Notre Dame, which God has so
						wonderfully blessed; the Sisters of Providence, to begin that institute, which possesses
						such a special charm of spirituality.</p>

					<p>On reaching his diocese, Bishop de la Hailandiere began to introduce system and order;
						he held a retreat for his clergy, followed by a Synod. The erection of the See of
						Chicago, in 1844, relieved him of the Illinois portion of his diocese, but his energy
						and activity were of the kind that, directed by another, effect great results, but
						which, when not accompanied by the power to direct and employ others, produce discontent
						and confusion. He resigned the See in 1847, and returned to Brittany, where he died in
						May, 1882. By his own desire, his remains were brought across the Atlantic by his near
						kinsman, the Rev. E. Audran, to be laid in the Cathedral, which he never ceased to
						love.</p>

					<p>Bishop Bazin, his successor, died in less than six months after his consecration; and
						the mitre of Vincennes was placed on the head of the Rev. Maurice de St. Palais, a
						native of the diocese of Montpelier, who had been on the Indiana mission since 1836, an
						earnest laborer, cheerfully enduring hardships and perils of no ordinary character. His
						appointment was welcomed by all; and his first work the establishment of asylums, for
						the care of the orphans. It was to his zeal that Indiana is indebted for the
						introduction of the Benedictine monks, from the famous Abbey of Einsiedlen, who made St.
						Meinrad, so well known.</p>

					<p>Bishop de St. Palais' labors in Indiana as priest and bishop covered a term of nearly
						fifty years. It was, therefore, especially under his care that religion developed, the
						administrations of his predecessors having been too brief, to do more than plan the good
						they desired to accomplish.</p>

					<p>He died in June, 1877, Bishop of Vincennes, having declined the appointment of
						Arch-bishop of Toulouse. He was not even Bishop of the whole State of Indiana, the See
						of Fort Wayne having been erected in 1857, which comprised the Northern part of
						Indiana.</p>

					<p>Naturally, the heads of various orders and religious communities exercised jurisdiction
						over their subjects, such as the Franciscans, the Dominicans, the Jesuits and others,
						who labored in various regions of this vast country, from the earliest days. When,
						however, the first Bishop of Quebec was installed in the year 1674, this Bishop and his
						successors exercised jurisdiction over the territory, now known as Indiana, Michigan,
						Illinois, Maine, Ohio and New York. The British Colonies on the Atlantic coast, from New
						Hampshire to Georgia, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, were subject to the
						Vicars Apostolic of the London district, England. During this time, Florida and

					<p>Pope Pius VI appointed the Rev. John Carroll Prefect Apostolic in the United States, in

						erected the new See of Baltimore, on November 6, 1789. Bishop Carroll was consecrated

						synod was held at Baltimore, with an attendance of twenty-two priests, on November 7,
						1791. In 1800, Bishop Neale became Bishop Carroll's Coadjutor. On April 8, 1808, Pope
						Pius VII raised Baltimore to the rank of a Metropolitan See, and founded the new
						dioceses of Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Bardstown. The Catholic population, at
							<pb id="VAB8203-022" n="22"/> this time, was estimated at about 25,000, with 68
						priests, 80 churches, several religious orders and three colleges. Rt. Rev. John Carroll
						was born in Maryland, January 8, 1735. He attended the college at St. Omer in Flanders,
						and entered the Society of Jesus at Watton, 1753. He was ordained priest in 1761. In
						June, 1774, he returned to America and labored there, as a secular priest, in Maryland
						and Virginia. He was consecrated Bishop, August 15, 1790, and was made Archbishop in
						1808. He died December 3, 1815. Pastoral letters show the Bishop caring for his flock;
						his controversy with Wharton and others show his ability in defending the faith against
						assaults.</p>

					<p>Rt. Rev. Benedict Joseph Flaget was born of a widowed mother, November 7, 1763, at
						Coutournat, France. Two years old his mother also died, and an aunt took charge of the
						boy. He began his study of philosophy and theology, at the age of seventeen, in the
						Seminary at Clermont, finishing the same at Issy, and was ordained priest in 1788. When
						the French Revolution broke up all institutions of learning in France, Father Flaget
						sailed for Baltimore, in 1792. Bishop Carroll sent him to Vincennes, Indiana, where he
						arrived December 21, 1792. He was recalled to Baltimore in 1795. On November 4, 1810, he
						was consecrated Bishop of Bardstown, having up to that time been engaged mostly in
						teaching. He visited Indiana several times as Bishop, but whether he came as far as the
						present diocese of Fort Wayne, is not known. Bishop David became his Coadjutor in 1819,
						Bishop Chabrat in 1834, and, at the time of his death, it was Bishop Spalding. "He died,
						as he had lived, a saint," says Bishop Spalding, "on February 11, 1850." The diocese of
						Bardstown, when first established, comprised Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio and all the
						Northwest. Our historian Shea says of Bishop Flaget: <q>"No Bishop, in this country, has
							ever been regarded as equalling Bishop Flaget in sanctity, in the spirit of prayer, in
							the ardor of his devotion, his firmness, patience and constant devotion to all the
							duties of his State."</q> A number of seemingly well-authenticated miraculous cures
						were ascribed to Bishop Flaget, while visiting France. An account of these cures,
						bearing every evidence of a miraculous nature, was given in "The Record," published at
						Louisville, under dates of January 26 <pb id="VAB8203-023" n="23"/> and February 2,
						1905. It was in 1841 Bishop Flaget's See was transferred from Bardstown to
						Louisville.</p>

					<p>The diocese of Vincennes was established in 1834. It comprised Indiana, and Illinois
						east of a line from Fort Massac along the Eastern boundaries of Johnson, Franklin,
						Jefferson, Marion, Fayette, Shelby and Mann Counties to the Illinois river, eight miles
						above Ottawa, and thence to the Northern boundary of the State.</p>

					<p>The Rt. Rev. Simon Gabriel Brute de Remur was born at Rennes, the capital of Brittany,
						in France, on March 20, 1779. The untimely death of his father threw the responsibility
						of his education on his mother, a woman of strong Christian character. How well she
						succeeded may be learned from the Bishop's reminiscences referring to his first
						Communion, where he says: <q>"I thank Thee, O my God, for the state of innocence and
							piety I was in the day I performed this most important act. My heart is full when I
							think of that day-- thanks, thanks, O my God!"</q> A retentive memory, a lively
						imagination, and close application made him a ripe and accomplished scholar. He was well
						advanced in his studies, having become familiar with Latin and Greek, when the
						revolution broke out. During this reign of terror, unhappy France was deluged with the
						blood of her best and noblest sons. He witnessed it all. Having entered the medical
						college in 1796, he graduated 1803. In the same year, however, he gave up the practice
						of medicine and entered the Seminary of St. Sulpice, at Paris. Five years of earnest and
						brilliant studies in theology, brought him to the gates of the sanctuary, and he was
						ordained priest in 1808. Following Bishop Flaget to America, he landed at Baltimore on
						August 10, 1810. He was there made president of St. Mary's College, and donated it his
						library of 5,000 volumes. We are told, <q>"He was an oracle of learning to the clergy
							and bishops of the country. Indeed, from his secluded home in the mountain, his
							influence was felt throughout the entire Church of America,"--</q> the influence of a
						learned and holy man.</p>

					<p>He was consecrated Bishop of Vincennes, October 28, 1834, at St. Louis by Bishop
						Flaget, assisted by Bishops Rosati and Purcell. He was duly installed on November 5, by
						the same Bishops, at Vincennes. What he found in his diocese <pb id="VAB8203-024" n="24"
						/> was: Two priests, a cathedral of four brick walls' and roof unplastered and
						unwhitewashed, without sanctuary, a residence of a single room 25x12 feet, a revenue of
						$100 pew rent per annum, and a subscription list of $240 for his support. A visitation
						of his diocese revealed to him the great need of priests, and means to erect churches,
						and to supply these he visited France. After incredible hardships and labors, he died
						June 26, 1839, of consumption, the result of a severe cold caught while riding on the
						outside of a coach, in Ohio, on his way to the Council at Baltimore. His remains rest in
						the crypt of the Cathedral of Vincennes.</p>

					<p>It must be of great interest to the reader, to ascertain the status, in those days, of
						what is now the diocese of Fort Wayne. We can do no better, in this respect, than to
						quote from Bishop Brute's letter to the Leopoldine Association for the propagation of
						the faith, giving a full account of his first episcopal visitation in his diocese: <q>
							<p>"I went North in Illinois as far as Chicago on Lake Michigan. Rev. St. Cyr had
								arrived there from St. Louis, and enabled the Catholics to make their Easter
								Communion, so I gave only a few Confirmation. Chicago is now composed of about four
								hundred souls, French, Canadians, Americans, Irish, and a good number of Germans.
								From Chicago we went around the end of Lake Michigan to the river St. Joseph, and
								the mission of the Rev. de Seille, at the Indian village at Pokegan, situated just
								outside of our diocese, and in that of Detroit. This mission was established, many
								years ago, by the Venerable Father Badin. Father de Seille has lived three or four
								years at Pokegan. On Thursday evening we arrived at South Bend, a little town
								beautifully situated on the high banks of the St. Joseph river. It is growing
								rapidly, owing to its many advantages. Crossing the river, we visited St. Mary of
								the Lake, the mission house of the excellent Father Badin, who has lately moved to
								Cincinnati. He had a school there kept by two Sisters, who have also gone away,
								leaving the place vacant. The 625 acres of land attached to it, and the small lake
								named St. Mary's, make it a most desirable spot and one soon, I hope, to be occupied
								by some prosperous institution. Rev. Badin has transferred it to the Bishop on the
								condition of his assuming the debts, a trifling consideration compared with the
								importance of the place. On <pb id="VAB8203-025" n="25"/> Friday morning we left for
								the Tippecanoe river, and the village of Chickagos. The Indians had heard of our
								coming, and had sent some of their number in advance, to ascertain our movement.
								They gave notice of our approach to others, who had camped out a few miles to wait
								for the Bishop, and to make a more worthy escort for him. The chief of the Chickagos
								was there and directed the movements. Coffee had been prepared at the small village,
								only three miles from the principal one. We dismounted, and sitting on mats of woven
								straw partook of their kind cheer. Then we crossed the river and soon arrived.</p>
							<p>"Chickagos village is not so large as Pokegan, yet the chapel is nearly as large.
								It is however without ceiling, and without a room for the missionary overhead. The
								mission being of later standing, Father de Seille had baptized only about 120
								persons, of whom I confirmed sixteen. Our interpreter was a Canadian woman seventy
								years of age, a truly deserving person. On our arrival all assembled in the chapel
								and Father de Seille introduced me as their Bishop, the head in these parts of all
								the other Black Robes. On Sunday morning, Father de Seille and myself sat upon two
								little stools in the chapel, and some twelve of the leading men came in and took
								their seats upon some of the opposite benches. Chickagos made the speech and, having
								expressed his confidence in Father de Seille and in me, he said he would present me
								with half a section, 320 acres of their land. Having replied through the
								interpreter, we prepared for Mass and Confirmation. Before Mass six children were
								baptised by me. We slept on the benches of the chapel, and some of the straw from
								the floor, wrapt up in our great-coats, after the manner of the good Father. Our
								food was boiled corn, fish, venison, and wild turkey, minced together in one dish,
								and some cranberries broken and mixed with sugar, they got from trees. Our drink was
								water, coffee was not to be had, although this was the principal village. I was to
								leave them after vespers, so before we began they came to sign the deed of the land,
								presented to the Church, which we had drawn up in as legal a form as we could. After
								a few parting words, and giving them my blessing, we mounted our horses and were
								escorted for some miles by a large number, Chickagos at their head, who before
								leaving us dismounted from their <pb id="VAB8203-026" n="26"/> horses, and asked
								their Bishop's blessing again. We spent the night at the house of a settler, fifteen
								miles from Chickagos, and found the house so full that many had to lie on the floor,
								as I had done once on my way to the lake. Here we had a bed for two, as was often
								the case. Through all that journey of 600 miles, we seldom came to any regular
								taverns, but almost every family would allow you to share their meals, and give you
								a place under their roof.</p>
							<p>"The day after we reached Logansport, a rapidly improving town on the canal, that
								is nearly completed and will unite the Wabash with the Maumee at Fort Wayne, and
								thus Lake Erie with the Ohio and the Mississippi, through the States of Indiana and
								Illinois. I found there a good number of Catholics, and promised to send them one of
								the first priests I could obtain. I said Mass the next morning and then left for
								home, yet some days' journey, passing through Fayetteville, Attica, Covington, Terre
								Haute, etc. Few Catholics are as yet collected in these growing towns, but soon
								there will be more. Shortly after my return, Father Lalumiere came home and the
								account of his journey was very consoling. He had found more Catholics than I had,
								and many places ready to receive a priest. In three places they had begun to build
								churches. At Fort Wayne they had finished one, 60x30 feet, and the congregation
								numbered 150 Catholic families. I was happy to send them the Rev. M. Ruff from Metz,
								in France, recently ordained and speaking the three languages, French, English and
								German. Of the latter there are a good many living there and in the environments. I
								had ordained Rev. M. Ruff subdeacon and deacon before my journey to Chicago, and had
								sent him to the Seminary of St. Louis (St. Mary of the Barrens), to make his
								retreat, and there he was ordained priest by that excellent prelate, Doctor
								Rosati."</p>

					<p>RIGHT REV. CELESTINE RENE LAWRENCE GUYNEMER DE LA HAILANDIERE, the second Bishop of
						Vincennes, was born at Combourg, in Brittany, May 2, 1798, and was baptized the same
						day, this being the time of the revolution, by a priest who was concealed in the house.
						He studied law, to fit himself for the magistracy. At the age of twenty-four, attending
						a mission given by the Fathers of the Faith, he resolved to renounce the world and the
						flattering prospects held out to <pb id="VAB8203-027" n="27"/> him. He entered the
						Seminary at Rennes, and was ordained at Paris, on May 28, 1825. When Bishop Brute
						requested the Bishop of Rennes, to give him the name of a priest worthy to be his Vicar
						General and Coadjutor, the Abbe de la Halandiere was selected. He came to America, in
						1836, but two years later was again sent to Europe in the interest of the diocese. While
						there busily engaged, information reached him at Paris, that Bishop Brute had died, and
						that he himself had been appointed Bishop Brute's Coadjutor. He was consecrated Bishop
						at Paris, by Bishop Forbin Janson, on August 18, 1839, and made every exertion to obtain
						needed aid for his diocese. He sent over vestments and sacred vessels for the churches,
						the Eudists to found a college, Fathers and Brothers of the Holy Cross, Sisters of
						Providence. After returning to his diocese, one of his first acts was to hold a retreat
						for his clergy, which was followed by a diocesan Synod, in 1844. Bishop Hailandiere was
						a man of restless activity, and his energy made him unpopular with many. Aware of this,
						he visited Rome, in 1845, to resign his see, but Pope Gregory XVI induced him to return
						to his diocese, and resume his labors. He did so, but the old troubles continued and new
						ones were added, so that in 1847 the Holy Father accepted his resignation. He returned
						to his native country and died on an estate belonging to the family, at Triandin, on May
						1, 1882. It was his desire that his remains be buried beneath the sanctuary of the
						Cathedral at Vincennes. His wish was complied with.</p>

					<p>RIGHT REV. JOHN STEPHEN BAZIN, third Bishop of Vincennes, was born in 1796, in the
						diocese of Lyons, France, where he entered the priesthood and came as a missionary to
						the diocese of Mobile, in 1830. He labored with great zeal and devotedness for the
						Church, in the city of Mobile, for a period of seventeen years. He was Bishop Portier's
						Vicar General. Upon the recommendation of the sixth Provincial Council of Baltimore, he
						was appointed Bishop of Vincennes. His consecration took place in the Cathedral at
						Vincennes, on October 24, 1847, Bishop Portier being the Consecrator. He issued a
						pastoral letter, in which he said to his clergy: <q>"Having been inured for many years
							to the labors of a missionary life, we feel ready, in spite of our advanced age, to
							share with you all the hardships of the ministry. We are ambitious of no <pb
								id="VAB8203-028" n="28"/> distinction. We expect to find in each of you a
							friend."</q> But in the Providence of God he was almost immediately stricken down, and
						expired on April 23, 1848.</p>

					<p>RIGHT REV. JAMES MAURICE DE LONG D'AUSSAC DE ST. PALAIS, D. D., the fourth Bishop of
						Vincennes, was born at La Salvatat, diocese of Montpelier, France, on November 15, 1811.
						He descended from one of the noblest families of France. His forefathers fought against
						the Moors and in the Crusades. His friends and relatives entertained well grounded
						hopes, as to the brilliancy of the future awaiting him. He received an education such as
						became a nobleman. The downfall of Charles X, and the revolution of 1830, convinced him
						of the vanity of all earthly things. In the twenty-fifth year of his age he was ordained
						priest, by the Archbishop of Paris.</p>

					<p>He heeded the invitation of Bishop Brute, seeking laborers for the Lord's vineyard in
						the wilds of Indiana, and following him arrived in Vincennes in 1836. He was assigned to
						a station about thirty-five miles east of Vincennes, where he built St. Mary's Church.
						Not understanding the German, he frequently made use of a Lutheran as an interpreter,
						translating his French and English sermon into German. The bulk of the money to build
						St. Mary's Church, was realized from the sale of a herd of hogs, which had been donated
						by the heads of families. It is said this was the best herd of hogs ever sold in Daviess
						county. He remained until 1839, when Bishop de la Hailandiere sent him to Chicago.
						Conditions in Chicago were not favorable; he met with much opposition from the
						dissatisfied portion of his flock. They first burnt his little shanty, and for two years
						refused to pay him any money, with the avowed purpose of starving him out, but he built
						St. Mary's Church at Chicago, which shortly after, in the year 1844, when Chicago was
						made an episcopal see, became its first cathedral.</p>

					<p>In that same year Father de St. Palais was removed to Logansport. He underwent
						incredible hardships, travelling through the wilderness without roads and without
						meeting a human habitation for fifty or a hundred miles. His saddlebags contained the
						requisites for the holy functions, together with a little sack of salt and cornmeal for
						his meals.</p>

					<p>In 1846, Father de St. Palais was sent to Madison, where he remained one year only.
						Bishop Bazin, in 1847, made him <pb id="VAB8203-029" n="29"/> his Vicar General and the
						Superior of the Seminary at Vincennes. He was administrator of the diocese from April
						23, 1848, until January 14, 1849, when Bishop Miles of Nashville consecrated Father de
						St. Palais Bishop of Vincennes. Almost the first work which he undertook and brought to
						a successful issue, was the erection of orphan asylums. And the other important work
						was, to look after the Seminary. He paid three visits ad limina, the first in 1849, the
						second in 1859, and the third in 1869. In 1844 the diocese of Chicago was established,
						and thereafter the diocese of Vincennes was restricted to Indiana. Thirteen years later,
						in 1857, the Northern half of Indiana was made the diocese of Fort Wayne. Bishop de St.
						Palais had been present at the commencement exercises at St. Mary's of the Woods, when
						on the morning of June 28, 1877, at five o'clock, he suffered a stroke of paralysis and
						died peacefully on the afternoon of the same day, at four o'clock. His remains rest
						beneath the sanctuary of the Cathedral at Vincennes.</p>

						<hi rend="b">CHAPTER III.</hi>
						<hi rend="sc">THE RIGHT REV. JOHN HENRY LUERS, D. D.<lb/> THE FIRST BISHOP OF FORT
							WAYNE.</hi>
					</head>

					<p>The Rt. Rev. John Henry Luers, D. D., was born on September 29, 1819, near the city of
						Munster, in Westphalia, a province of Germany. His parents were devoted Catholics. Poor
						in the goods of this world, and desirous of bettering their condition in life, the
						family emigrated in 1833, landing in New York on June 7th. Piqua, Ohio, located on the
						Miami river, and being the terminus of the Miami canal, connected Cincinnati on the Ohio
						river with Toledo on the Lakes. It was here, on a farm in the neighborhood of Piqua,
						that the Luers family settled down. John, however, became clerk and assistant salesman
						in a store in town. He was noted for strict integrity and attention to business, but
						alas! he began to neglect the exercise of his religion. When on one occasion the young
						clerk was paying his parents a visit, the father was amazed to find that his son John
						had forgotten his prayers. The Bishop himself in after life, alluding to this incident,
						often remarked: <q>"The subsequent interview between my father and myself was of such a
							striking nature, that I received sufficient reasons to promise to relearn, what I had
							forgotten. It was a <hi rend="i">sore</hi> lesson, but one which I never
						forgot."</q></p>

					<p>Having been called by God to serve Him in the sanctuary, John soon experienced a great
						change in his thoughts and feelings. His ardent desire was to become a priest. But how
						could he ever hope to acquire the education required, for this exalted station in life.
						Providence, however, had given him the vocation for the priesthood, and Providence also
						would provide the means for attaining this end. It is related, that when Archbishop
						Purcell was on his way to Piqua, in order to administer Confirmation, he overtook our
						John walking in the same direction. The Archbishop on inquiry fouud, that the boy was
						going to Mass, and invited him to mount and ride with the priest, accompanying him. The
						Archbishop soon discovered what was the great desire of the boy's heart, and <pb
							id="VAB8203-031" n="31"/> encouraged him saying: <q>"Fear not, my son; if God has
							destined you for the sanctuary, and has given you a vocation, He will in His wisdom
							provide the means. But you must pray, that God's will may be done."</q> From that
						moment the boy's desire, to devote himself exclusively to the service of God, became
						stronger and stronger. General M. D. Morrison one of his companions, afterwards a member
						of congress in Indiana, relates: <q>"Bishop Luers, when quite a boy with us in Piqua,
							suddenly stopped playing with the boys, and this being something unusual we often
							asked, what has become of John Luers? He never comes around with us any more. The
							reply given was: Why, he's got hold of some old Latin books, and he is studying them;
							he is going to be a Catholic priest. The next thing I heard of him was, that he had
							gone off somewhere to school."</q></p>

					<p>St. Francis Xavier's Seminary, in Brown county, Ohio, conducted by the Lazarists, was
						the only Alma Mater of Bishop Luers. It was Archbishop Purcell, who sent him here as a
						candidate for the priesthood. Bishop Luers did not possess a quick or brilliant mind,
						but rather, what is preferable, a profound mind. The reports sent, by the superiors of
						the seminary to the Archbishop, were most satisfactory. He thoroughly mastered the
						sciences he applied himself to, and in addition he fostered solid piety, and developed
						an ardent zeal and a generous desire to serve God, for the good of his neighbor.
						Archbishop Purcell ordained him subdeacon, in the Cathedral at Cincinnati, on All
						Saints' day, 1846; deacon on the feast of St. Charles Borromeo, and on November 11th, of
						the same year, in the twenty-seventh year of his age, he was ordained a priest of God.
						He was the last priest ordained in the old seminary in Brown county, which is now St.
						Martin's Convent of the Ursuline Nuns.</p>

					<p>Archbishop Purcell, much impressed with the evident zeal of the young priest, gave him
						charge of St. Joseph's Congregation, in Cincinnati, which was engaged in the work of the
						erection of a church, the walls of which were half up, but was paralyzed by a heavy
						debt. His advent infused new life into the enterprise. It was not long after, when St.
						Joseph's Church was completed, and all the debt paid off. Father Luers was indefatigable
						and untiring in his labors, to build up <pb id="VAB8203-032" n="32"/> the parish. He
						experienced in his own person, what, as Bishop later on, he often told his priests:
							<q>"I have somewhere read, that more men rust out than wear out; a piece of mechanism
							is more apt to get out of repair, when not employed, than when performing its
							accustomed labor."</q> So convinced was he of the importance of Catholic schools, that
						a substantial school house soon arose under his inspiration and direction, and it was
						his custom to visit the schools every day. The Catholic Telegraph, under date of July 6,
						1871, has this to say: <q>"Under his active, zealous care, this large church is rapidly
							finished, and the large debt as rapidly paid. It soon became under his pastoral
							guidance, one of the largest and most important German congregations in the city. In
							labor, Bishop Luers, during the years of his priesthood, was indefatigable. At St.
							Joseph's he has left a most eloquent testimony to his great worth. Though he parted
							from the scenes of his labors years ago, his former parishoners treasure, in undimmed
							remembrance, his name and good work, and speak of him, as if he were still walking
							reverent among them. Several, whom he baptized and prepared for their first Communion,
							are now worthy priests of the dioceses of Cincinnati and Fort Wayne."</q> During
						twelve years of most successful pastoral labor, Father Luers won the esteem of his
						Bishop and the love of his people, and it is not surprising, that when the diocese of
						Fort Wayne was established, he should be made its first Bishop.</p>

					<p>Nobody was more surprised than Father Luers himself, when he was informed, that the
						choice had fallen upon him for episcopal honors and labors. But with characteristic
						humility and simplicity he bowed his head, exclaiming: "Behold, Thy servant, O Lord!" He
						was consecrated a Bishop in the same cathedral, in which he had been ordained priest, on
						January 10, 1858. Archbishop Purcell was the consecrating prelate, and the Right Rev.
						Maurice de St. Palais, Bishop of Vincennes, and the Right Rev. George Aloysius Carroll,
						Bishop of Covington, were the assisting prelates; Very Rev. E. T. Collins, V. G., was
						archdeacon, and the Revs. J. C. Albrinck, of Pomeroy, and C. H. Borgess, of Columbus,
						afterwards Bishop of Detroit, were the deacon and subdeacon of the Pontifical Mass. The
						Right Rev. Martin J. Spalding, Bishop of Bardstown, preached the sermon. In the
						afternoon of the day of <pb id="VAB8203-033" n="33"/> his consecration, Bishop Luers was
						invited to visit St. Joseph's Church, of which he had been the efficient pastor. We
						quote again from the Catholic Telegraph: <q>"The sanctuary was brilliantly illumined,
							the church thronged to overflowing. A frame work erected in the sanctuary bore, in the
							midst of light, appropriate texts of Scripture; the choir commenced the proceedings
							with a hymn. The Rev. Stehle, aided by the Rev. Somers, who were afterwards charged
							with the care of the congregation, arranged rich offerings appertaining to the
							episcopal chapel and office, on a credence table, and an address was read to the new
							Bishop. The little boys and girls of the school, handsomely dressed, the girls in
							white and wearing bright crowns, the young unmarried men and ladies, the fathers and
							mothers of families, the officers of religious societies, and all the German Catholics
							of Cincinnati, through their able representative Father Otto, had a word and a gift
							for their Right Reverend friend, the delivery of which was interspersed with music
							from the choir. It was a heart-offering from all present to the merit and virtues of
							the faithful pastor now leaving them. The Archbishop and the Bishops of Vincennes and
							Covington, who were in the sanctuary, were deeply affected by this exhibition of an
							entire people's gratitude and faith."</q> Another witness of these impressive scenes
						has written: <q>"It was a touching sight to see St. Joseph's congregation on last Sunday
							afternoon, when the Bishop of Fort Wayne came to say farewell. Not a dry eye could be
							seen in the crowded edifice, and sobs were frequently heard breaking the solemn
							stillness of the church. After the exercises were over in the church, the newly
							consecrated prelate visited the schools, and here, to see and hear the tokens of
							sorrow every where visible, became perfectly painful; and it was only after repeated
							assurances, that he would often visit them, could their grief be restrained. Kneeling
							to receive his blessing, with a thousand wishes for his welfare, the impressive scene
							closed."</q></p>

					<p>Anxious to enter upon the work, assigned to him by the Holy See in the new diocese of
						Fort Wayne, he set out for the town of Fort Wayne in a day or two after his
						consecration. <q>"He arrived towards evening, alone and unannounced, carrying his
							traveling bag in his hand, at the door of the residence of Very Rev. Father
							Benoit."</q> What John A. Wilstach, Esquire, <pb id="VAB8203-034" n="34"/> wrote in
						his sketch of St. Mary's Church, of Lafayette, in the year 1893, will certainly prove of
						interest to our readers: <q>"It would seem that one of the first cares of Bishop Luers,
							in his new diocese, was to select his episcopal city. This had received a designation
							in his commission from the Vatican, because Archbishop Purcell, in the
							multifariousness of his duties, had suggested Fort Wayne, but an application to Rome
							by Bishop Luers would have immediately produced the change in the designation. Now it
							so happened, that from his first visit to the Star City of the West, Bishop Luers had
							desired to write after his name, Bishop of Lafayette. Here he found our beautiful
							situation, our shining river with its amphitheatre of crowning heights on either side.
							Here he found a body of educated Catholics willing to make, under his leadership, any
							sacrifice in his behalf, and here also, he found handsome and beautiful church and
							school improvements greatly superior to those existing in Fort Wayne. He selected,
							with an eye which taste and prophecy both guided, the plat of land now occupied by the
							Lafayette Public Library, and the buildings to the south of it and the Opera House to
							the east, as the seat of the Cathedral, an episcopal residence, school, convent and
							hospital. This unsurpassable tract of land, almost in the center of the city, was to
							be obtained, partly by purchase and partly by gift. The gift was to be from the city,
							and the project was voted down in the city council by one vote, and that the vote of
							the <hi rend="i">member from the first ward.</hi> History and tradition have
							consigned, or should consign, his name to oblivion, and there let it rest."</q></p>

					<p>Bishop Luers found his Cathedral, at Fort Wayne, to be a small frame church in a
						delapidated condition, and the episcopal residence was a brick structure, erected by
						Rev. A. Bessonies, who had charge of the parish during the absence of Father Benoit in
						Louisiana. He also found, that his diocese comprised forty-two counties extending north
						from the northern boundaries of Fountain, Montgomery, Boone, Hamilton, Madison,
						Delaware, Randolph and Warren counties, a distance of 120 miles, and from the Ohio State
						Line to the Illinois State Line, a distance of 170 miles. Having appointed Father Benoit
						his Vicar General, he set out to visit his diocese, and it can be said truthfully, that
						he was hardly ever to be found at home, in <pb id="VAB8203-035" n="35"/> Fort Wayne. He
						manifested great affection for his priests, encouraging them in their arduous labors,
						and sharing these labors with them whenever and wherever he could. He travelled the
						length and breadth of his diocese, over and over again, anxious to be where he might be
						of service. In all his travels, however, which were both night and day, he always
						managed to have the opportunity for celebrating Mass. He used to say: <q>"God derives
							more glory from the celebration of one Mass, than from all the praises of the angels
							in heaven. Ought not priests to give God that glory no matter at what personal
							inconvenience?"</q> It is related of him, that, when knocking at a priest's house for
						admission at a rather early hour, the window was thrown up, and a voice was heard to
						say: <q>"Be off to-- out of that! Don't you know, that his reverence is sick, and can't
							go on sick calls? A pretty time of the day you are calling."</q> The window closed
						amid a shower of abuse on the unknown Bishop. He quietly walked, valise in hand, to the
						convent, where he met with a cordial reception. He said: <q>"There was a man down at
							Father--'s house who ordered me to rather warm quarters, but I thought it better to
							come and say Mass."</q> Another quotation from Mr. Wilstach's production will give us
						an insight into the Bishop's character and work: <q>"He spared himself no labors
							official or menial, religious or domestic, of the house or of the field, of the city
							or of the country. Well is it remembered by those, who were present on one autumn
							Sunday in St. Mary's church, at Lafayette, how his face and his hands were so bronzed
							by the labor of the field's harvest work at the orphan farm near Rensselaer, that he
							hardly passed for white. His hands hung down black over the front of the pulpit (a
							favorite attitude with him), and his face rose above the purple cape as black as his
							hands."</q> From all of which we conclude, that Bishop Luers was, in very truth, a
						pioneer bishop preparing the way for the elegance and comforts of the bishops of later
						generations.</p>

					<p>During his administration biennial retreats of the clergy were held at the University
						of Notre Dame, an accommodation which has ever since been a great advantage to the
						diocesan clergy. At the conclusion of these spiritual exercises, synods were held to
						regulate the affairs of the diocese, both as to temporalities and spiritualities. Among
						other things, the <pb id="VAB8203-036" n="36"/> Bishop checked effectually the
						pernicious system of over-zealous lay trusteeism.</p>

					<p>Bishop Luers was distinguished for his devotion to the Holy See. He had a great desire
						to visit the Eternal City, and to manifest his loyalty to the Vicar of Christ on earth,
						in the person of Pius IX. Accordingly he started upon his pilgrimage to Rome, on May 29,
						1864, accompanied by the Rev. A. B. Oechtering, leaving the administration of the
						diocese in the hands of his Vicar General, Father Benoit. On his way he visited Louvain,
						where he secured four young levites for his diocese. At Rome he was received with great
						kindness by the Holy Father, and was entrusted with the drawing up of the constitution
						and rules for the Sisters of the Holy Cross, in America, with a view to having them
						approved ultimately by the Holy See. Upon his return, he continued his arduous labors
						for the advancement of every great interest of his diocese. It was he, who adopted a
						plan for the support of aged and infirm priests, under the title of the Catholic
						Clerical Benevolent Association of the Diocese of Fort Wayne.</p>

					<p>On many an occasion did the earnest Bishop become the public champion and defender of
						the faith. In their controversies with him, tricky controversialists met with a great
						surprise and an overwhelming and silencing defeat. Having been attacked in the public
						press because of his attitude in the defence of Catholic Education, he replied in a
						card, from which we make this extract: <q>"It is with me a matter of sincere regret,
							that our non-Catholic friends will not understand the Catholic position upon the
							so-called public school question. We do not object to Protestants sending their
							children to the public schools, nor to their supporting them by a tax, or in any other
							way they may deem fit. We have not the slightest intention of interfering with their
							existence. They may, perhaps, think they are well adapted to the wants of those who
							patronize them, but Catholic parents, who realize the sacred obligations of preparing
							their children, not only for this life but for the life to come, prefer to see their
							children in schools where religious instruction and moral discipline go hand in hand
							with secular education. Many Catholics regard it a hardship, that they should be taxed
							to support a school system that they do not and cannot approve; but in Indiana it is
							the <pb id="VAB8203-037" n="37"/> creature of the State Constitution, and until that
							instrument is changed or amended in this particular, Catholics, as law abiding
							citizens, must continue to bear their share of the burden, as well as assume their
							share of the responsibility."</q></p>

					<p>Bishop Luers attended the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, which assembled on the
						first Sunday of October, 1866; but he was not present at the Oecumenical Council of the
						Vatican, convened by Pius IX, having been excused, partly on account of the needs of his
						own diocese and partly that he might serve neighboring dioceses, in the absence of their
						bishops. During this time he travelled much, and there is little doubt but that he
						administered confirmation in every county of three States, and also conferred holy
						orders in the seminaries. It was not, however, without regret, that he was obliged to
						absent himself from the Vatican Council, being most anxious to give his homage to the
						Vicar of Christ, and to record his approval of the Definition of the Dogma of Papal
						Infallibility.</p>

					<p>The end of his life is another evidence of the uncertainty of the hour and place and
						circumstances, when death may call upon us. On June 29, 1871, he gave Minor Orders to
						three seminarians and conferred Deaconship on another, in Cleveland. After breakfast,
						preferring to walk rather than to ride, on his way to the railway station he intended to
						make a call at the episcopal residence, when, on the corner of Bond and St. Clair
						streets he fell, having suffered a stroke of apoplexy. Having been carried to the
						Bishop's house, he received absolution, Extreme Unction and the last Indulgence, and
						within fifteen or twenty minutes he expired. Clergymen and laymen from both dioceses,
						escorted the remains from Cleveland to Fort Wayne; even a delegation from the deceased
						Bishop's old parish, St. Joseph's, at Cincinnati, was present to pay its tribute of love
						and gratitude. The funeral took place in the Cathedral at Fort Wayne, on July 4th, and
						was attended by Archbishop Purcell and the Bishops de St. Palais, O'Hara, Toebbe,
						McCloskey and Borgess. Archbishop Purcell preached the sermon, from which we quote a
						single sentence: <q>"Bishop Luers presided over the diocese of Fort Wayne with marked
							zeal and ability."</q> The remains of the first Bishop of Fort Wayne rest in the Crypt
						beneath the sanctuary of the Cathedral.</p>

						<lb/>
						<hi rend="sc">THE RIGHT REV. JOSEPH DWENGER, C. PP. S., D. D.<lb/> THE SECOND BISHOP OF
							FORT WAYNE.</hi>
					</head>

					<p>H. Dwenger and his wife, the parents of Bishop Dwenger, emigrated from Aukum, Hanover,
						in the diocese of Osnabrueck, to the United States in the spring of 1837. They bought
						forty acres of land in Mercer county, Ohio, near the present town of St. John. Having
						cleared a spot of the huge oak trees, they built a log hut, which became their home. In
						this humble abode, Joseph, the future Bishop of Fort Wayne, saw the light of day, on
						September 7, 1837. When in after years the Bishop referred to his birth place, he would
						say: <q>"I was born between four big oak stumps, in a dense forest of Mercer county,
							Ohio."</q> There were indeed four and more oak stumps around the log cabin of his
						birth. On the morning after Joseph's birth, the father hailed a neighbor passing his
						dwelling, saying to him: <q>"Last night God sent us a little bishop!"</q> The memory of
						this strange remark after seventy years, still lives with older members of St. John's
						parish, in Mercer county. What could have induced the father to speak thus to his
						neighbor? Was it a prophecy!</p>

					<p>Joseph was about three years old, when Providence visited the happy family with a
						severe affliction. The father, whose strong arm protected and supported the mother,
						Joseph and his two older brothers, was removed from their midst at the call of death.
						The sorrow-stricken widow was left in destitute and helpless condition. In the hope of
						finding support for herself and children she went to Cincinnati, and became a member of
						Holy Trinity parish. When of age Joseph attended the parochial school of Holy Trinity,
						where, owing to his talents and industry, he made rapid progress in the elementary
						branches of education.</p>

					<p>In the early summer of 1849, we find the widow and her son Joseph again occupying the
						log cabin in Mercer county. Why she should leave a comfortable home and her two older
						sons in Cincinnati and with Joseph alone return to the woods <pb id="VAB8203-039" n="39"
						/> in Mercer county, is an incident in Joseph's life full of significance, inspired by
						heaven; as the sequel shows. The cholera of 1849 spared the mother and her son; but in
						October of the same year both were prostrated on a bed of sickness, and, in the case of
						the widow, of death also. Rev. Andrew Kunkler, C. PP. S., the pastor of St. John's was
						called, and he found her at death's door. He administered to her all the helps of
						religion, and every comfort human consolation can give. But, the poor mother was much
						troubled. She pointed to the little cot, on which lay her son Joseph sick and
						unconscious, saying: <q>"I am willing to die, but what will become of my dear Joseph,
							when I am no more?"</q> Father Kunkler, ever ready to console and assist the afflicted
						and needy, promised he would take upon himself the care of the boy. Such are the ways of
						Providence. Contented and with a smile on her countenance, the widow Dwenger departed
						this life, on October 25, 1849. Joseph, now an orphan, was not homeless, for Father
						Kunkler carried him on his arms into the priest's house and cared for him. The boy soon
						recovered and waxed healthy and strong.</p>

					<p>Joseph knew well the desire of his mother, often expressed, to have him become a
						priest, and could easily perceive that his protector Father Kunkler, would have him
						become one of the Fathers of the Precious Blood. He considered seriously and prayed
						earnestly. At last, in 1854, after five years of probation, he became a member of the
						Congregation of the Most Precious Blood. Shortly after the Provincial, Very Rev. Francis
						Sales Brunner, sent him to Mount St. Mary's Seminary at Cincinnati, for the study of
						philosophy and theology; of which Revs. Rosecranz, Quinlan and Barry were the
						professors. At the seminary Joseph was known as the "Western Ohio student." He made
						rapid progress in his studies, and being punctual in all matters of discipline, endeared
						himself to his professors and his superiors, as well as Archbishop Purcell. He received
						tonsure and minor orders on December 19, 1857. On August 20, 1859, he was ordained
						subdeacon and on the day following deacon. Priesthood was conferred on him by Archbishop
						Purcell, on September 4, 1859. Father Dwenger celebrated his first Mass on September 8,
						1859, in St. John's Church, not far from the place where he was born.</p>

					<p>The Seminary of the Congregation of the Most Precious <pb id="VAB8203-040" n="40"/>
						Blood, which had been transferred from the diocese of Cleveland to that of Cincinnati,
						in 1859, was located at Himmelgarten Convent, near St. Henry, Mercer county, Ohio.
						Father Dwenger was appointed its rector and also filled the office of a professor. This
						location however of the seminary was neither convenient nor satisfactory. Father Dwenger
						was empowered by the Society PP. S. to purchase at Carthagena the so-called "Emlen
						Institution," which for a time had been a manual labor school for colored children, but
						had been abandoned and was then the property of a John Smith. With the assistance of
						Christopher Schunk, Father Dwenger effected the purchase in March, 1861. Mr. Smith was
						under the impression that he was selling the property to a Protestant minister. In May,
						1861, the building just purchased was remodeled and repaired and the seminary installed
						here, with Father Dwenger as its rector and professor. Father Dwenger was physically an
						imposing figure full of vitality and health. He devoted himself to the discharge of his
						duties with his whole soul, and great and not unfounded were the hopes entertained with
						regard to him. He was of an impulsive nature and at times would appear too harsh but
							<q>"after a little harmless explosion of his patience, the next moment all was serene
							again; he would never harbor any grudge in his heart."</q> In the seminary he was a
						strict disciplinarian and he would not tolerate a lazy and careless student; whilst the
						diligent student always found in him a kind father and teacher. He filled the position
						of rector and professor at the seminary during three years.</p>

					<p>In 1864, he was appointed pastor at Wapakoneta and of St. Mary's, Auglaize county,
						Ohio, having charge at the same time of the parish at Glynnwood. He began the erection
						of a new church in St. Mary's, in 1866. The parish was small in number and poor; but
						owing to his intense activity he collected funds near and far, so much so that when the
						new church was dedicated on November 19, 1867, $12,000 had been collected and the
						structure was free from every indebtedness. Having been most successful as the rector
						and a professor of the seminary and also as a pastor and a church builder, Father
						Dwenger was now assigned to the work of giving missions. He was engaged in this work
						from 1868 to 1872, giving missions in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and in other States.
						Sometimes he <pb id="VAB8203-041" n="41"/> was accompanied by one priest or other of the
						Community, but generally he did the work unassisted. He was successful in his work owing
						to his great earnestness and popular style of preaching.</p>

					<p>Father Dwenger was befriended by Archbishop Purcell, who chose him as his theologian
						and secretary at the Council of Baltimore, in 1866. The Archbishop frequently had him as
						a companion on confirmation trips through Mercer and Auglaize counties. On one occasion,
						while at dinner, one of the Fathers present asked His Grace, whether he could not
						delegate Rev. Joseph Dwenger to drive out and administer confirmation. The Archbishop
						answered: <q>"Of course I might, but I am afraid he would impart too severe a blow."</q>
						Father Dwenger attended the Second Council of Baltimore representing Very Rev. Andrew
						Kunkler, the Provincial of the C. PP. S. It can be said truthfully that he was a ruling
						spirit in all the transactions of the Congregation, to which he belonged. The Provincial
						had the utmost confidence in his prudence and business tact; so much so that he had
						Father Dwenger to preside over nearly all the meetings. On the other hand, Father
						Dwenger was most devoted and attached to his benefactor and was ever ready to do all in
						his power for the benefit of the Community. It may be mentioned here that when Father
						Joseph was deliberating whether to accept or decline the mitre he wrote Father Kunkler a
						most affectionate letter asking him for direction. He concluded the letter with these
						words: "I shall always remain your Joseph."</p>

					<p>The See of Fort Wayne having been made vacant by the death of Bishop Luers, Pope Pius
						IX appointed Father Dwenger Bishop of Fort Wayne. He was consecrated in the Cathedral of
						Cincinnati by Archbishop Purcell, assisted by Bishops Toebbe and Borgess, on April 14,
						1872. Without any delay the new Bishop repaired to the future scene of his labors, and
						began by investigating the condition of his diocese. He found the diocese somewhat
						involved financially, but as we have seen he was not a novice in finances, and in the
						course of time wiped out the existing indebtedness. On April 28, 1874, Bishop Dwenger
						addressed a circular to his clergy, from which we quote the first sentence:
							<q>"Conscious of the awful responsibilities of my Holy Office, and my own weakness and
								<pb id="VAB8203-042" n="42"/> imperfections, I leave Fort Wayne the 10th of May
							next, to make a pilgrimage to Lourdes, and to the shrines of the Apostles, hoping
							thereby to obtain some special graces from God for the salvation of my poor soul; to
							obtain for myself and my diocese the blessing of our venerable and saintly Pontiff,
							Pius IX, and to obtain other benefits for my diocese."</q> This was the first American
						pilgrimage to Rome and Lourdes. Should any of our readers enjoy the happy privilege of
						visiting the Grotto of Lourdes, let them, on entering the magnificent basilica look to
						the left, and among the many votive offerings with which the wall is covered, they will
						perceive a beautiful American flag with its red, white and blue and with its stars and
						stripes, left there by Bishop Dwenger, leader of the pious band of pilgrims, venerating
						Mary Immaculate at her holy shrine.</p>

					<p>What will, among other acts of his, keep the memory of Bishop Dwenger in benediction,
						is his care of the orphans. The asylum near Rensselaer, for both the boys and the girls,
						had become inadequate, and the location undesirable. In 1875, Bishop Dwenger purchased
						fifty acres of land near Lafayette, on which he erected a four story brick building at a
						cost of about $30,000. This new institution known as the St. Joseph's Asylum and Manual
						Labor School, is devoted to the care of the orphan boys.</p>

					<p>His pastoral and missionary work had convinced Bishop Dwenger of the importance and
						necessity of a parochial school in every parish. Hence he insisted not only that pastors
						must provide these schools, but he also established a Diocesan School Board, in 1879,
						consisting of ten priests, to whom he entrusted the supervision of the parochial schools
						of the diocese. The members of this Board were obliged to visit and examine all the
						parochial schools in their respective district, at least once a year, and to report to
						the Bishop concerning the condition of these schools. The same system has been adopted
						in many dioceses of the country.</p>

					<p>In 1883, Bishop Dwenger on his way to Rome to make his official visit ad limina, again
						visited Lourdes. At Rome he received deserved recognition, for his labors in the distant
						American diocese. Surrounded by his clergy and laity and with heartfelt wishes for an
						administration "ad multos annos," <pb id="VAB8203-043" n="43"/> Bishop Dwenger
						celebrated his Sacerdotal Silver Jubilee in 1884. In November and December of the same
						year the Bishop attended the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, where, among the
						thirteen Archbishops and seventy Bishops he was the nineteenth in rank and seniority. In
						March, 1885, he again visited Rome, this time in the interests of the Council and as the
						representative of the American Hierarchy. While in Rome he was the guest of the American
						College, where he spent seven months. During this time the decrees of the Council of
						Baltimore were presented by him to the Propaganda, and were approved. He was in Rome on
						the 4th of July, which the American students were anxious to celebrate. However it was
						thought inadvisable to display the American flag in such close proximity to the
						Quirinal. At this juncture Bishop Dwenger stept forward, and commanded in a way that
						could not be misunderstood: "Boys, hoist the American flag!" Instantly the Stars and
						Stripes were floated on high, and the American students sang: "Hail Columbia." When the
						Italian government intended to confiscate the American College in Rome, Bishop Dwenger
						hastened to Washington protesting in his own name and in the name of the American
						Hierarchy that the College was American property. At the instance of Secretary Blaine
						the Italian government gave assurance that the College would not be confiscated.</p>

					<p>In 1886 the Bishop gave another evidence of his love for the orphans by erecting, on
						the twenty-five acre lot within the limits of the city of Fort Wayne, a magnificent
						structure to serve as an asylum for the orphan girls. The Bishop made his fourth and
						last visit to Rome in 1888, more for the sake of his health, than to transact any
						important business. Anxious to do still more for Catholic education the Bishop induced
						the Fathers C. PP. S. to establish what is now known as St. Joseph's College near
						Rensselaer. The College was opened in September, 1891, but Bishop Dwenger, whose health
						was declining, was unable to assist at its dedication. The Community of the Precious
						Blood has redeemed the land where the College now stands, and which was a great swamp,
						by spending on its improvement and on the construction of the buildings a sum of over
						$100,000.</p>

					<p>While enjoying good health Bishop Dwenger was truly a <pb id="VAB8203-044" n="44"/>
						good shepherd of his diocese. He frequently visited all the parishes for confirmation
						and other episcopal functions. When however his health failed him more and more and
						became enfeebled by constant exertion he succumbed to a severe attack of heart trouble.
						His last effort to improve his health was a visit to New Mexico, which visit had little
						or no effect. Returning he resigned himself to what was evidently God's will and
						prepared for the end, which came after a lingering illness of nearly three years, on
						January 23, 1893. The funeral obsequies took place on January 26th. The Pontifical
						Requiem Mass was celebrated by Archbishop Elder. The prelates present in the sanctuary
						were: Archbishop Katzer of Milwaukee, Bishop Foley of Detroit, Bishop Horstmann of
						Cleveland, Bishop Janssen of Belleville, Bishop Maes of Covington, Bishop Rademacher of
						Nashville, Bishop Richter of Grand Rapids and Bishop Vertin of Marquette. Besides these
						dignitaries over two hundred priests attended. Members of the C. PP. S., to which the
						deceased Bishop belonged, present were: The Very Rev. H. Drees, Provincial; Rev. F.
						Nigsch, Procurator; Revs. Dickmann and Seifert, Consultors, and sixteen other Fathers.
						Bishop Rademacher delivered the funeral oration, selecting for his text <bibl>I
							Macabees, Ch. V, 19-21:</bibl>
						<q>"How is the mighty man fallen that saved Israel."</q> The preacher dwelling on the
						character of the deceased Bishop said: <q>"Bishop Dwenger as all who have had the
							pleasure of knowing him will admit, was cast by nature in what we may call a grand
							heroic mould. Physically he was at least in the prime of his vigorous life-- a perfect
							specimen of manhood. His powers of endurance and his capacity for hard work were
							simply marvelous. Even when by the labors of his long ministry, his powers began to
							wane, the long sickness which he endured also attested the wonderful strength and
							vitality of his constitution. In that vigorous body there dwelt a soul, equally
							vigorous and highly gifted; and we may truly say that his strong constitution, and
							especially his strong and expressive countenance, were a faithful index to the strong
							soul that dwelt within and ruled that body. His mind was clear and logical, and he was
							eminently practical. His memory was prodigious-- both faithful and retentive. His will
							was strong and unbending, when he believed himself in the right, and especially when
							he defended what he considered <pb id="VAB8203-045" n="45"/> right and just. As for
							his heart, it was true as steel, and noble, world-wide and generous in its sympathies,
							as Holy Church itself. As for, his love of the country it is strange that it should
							ever have been called in question. As he said himself, he was born under an oak tree,
							that is to say, in poverty; but the roots of that oak tree were not struck deeper and
							more firmly into the soil than the love of his country had struck its roots in the
							heart of the great Bishop. As for his love of the Church, it amounted simply to
							loyalty and chivalry. He was indeed in every sense a most devoted son of the Church,
							and he was a most true and model son of his country."</q></p>

						<lb/>
						<hi rend="sc">THE RIGHT REV. JOSEPH RADEMACHER, D. D.<lb/> THE THIRD BISHOP OF FORT
							WAYNE.</hi>
					</head>

					<p>The Right Rev. Joseph Rademacher, the third Bishop of Fort Wayne, was born in
						Westphalia, Clinton county, Michigan, on December 3, 1840. His parents sent him to the
						Benedictine College, near Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in 1855. Here he made his classical and
						philosophical studies and also began the study of theology, which latter however he
						completed in St. Michael's Seminary. in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. Bishop Luers accepted
						him for the diocese of Fort Wayne, and ordained him a priest on August 2, 1863.</p>

					<p>His first field of labor was Attica and its vicinity, of which place he was made the
						first resident pastor. He also attended Covington and the entire country East and West,
						from Odell to the Illinois State Line. He found the church and house devoid of every
						convenience. The pews in the church were rough boards and store boxes; but he provided
						an altar, new pews and a little reed organ. The year 1865 became a memorable year, for
						in it, for the first time, a first communion class was admitted in the month of May, and
						at the same time Bishop Luers administered confirmation. It is well known, that the
						congregation was small and poor, and that Father Rademacher had to submit to many
						privations and hardships, but he never uttered a word of complaint. In 1870, he was
						transferred to Columbia City. When, in 1872, the pastorate of St. Mary's church, at Fort
						Wayne, became vacant, he was appointed to succeed Rev. J. Weutz. He had for his
						assistant the Rev. Charles Steurer. Having done faithful service here for seven years,
						he was transferred to St. Mary's Church at Lafayette, in 1880, of which he remained the
						pastor till June 24, 1883. He was noted for zeal and prudence, and endearing himself to
						all, by his gentle and fatherly disposition, he was familiarly known as Father Joseph.
							<q>"Besides being remarkable for his intellectual, social and religious qualities,
							Father Rademacher was remarkable also for his devotion to literature, <pb
								id="VAB8203-047" n="47"/> not only theological but general. He joined to his
							knowledge of men and of affairs a close knowledge of books, and a memory which
							retained every thing which his mind acquired. A proof of this was furnished the writer
							one day in a singular manner. The writer had closely examined, only a few hours
							before, the early history of France. Entering into discourse with Father Rademacher,
							the conversation turned on this early history, and especially the significance of the
							battle of Soissonnes, as one of the decisive battles of Europe. As to this
							significance, the writer was giving his ideas. That was in the year 486, interposed
							the pastor. Continued the interlocutor, yes, the king of the Franks had no ordinary
							antagonist. Syagrius, the Roman governor, again interposed the pastor. His
							interlocutor paused for a moment in wonder, and then put the question: Tell me, pray,
							Father Rademacher, how did you happen to know so exactly this date and this name? Ah!
							he responded, I have read the history of those times."</q></p>

					<p>The See of Nashville, Tennessee, having become vacant upon the translation of Bishop
						Feehan to Chicago, in April, 1883, Father Rademacher was appointed his successor, and
						was consecrated Bishop of Nashville on June 24th of that same year. His Vicar General
						and intimate friend, Rev. P. J. Gleeson, in reply to an inquiry, writes: <q>"It gives me
							pleasure to do anything to honor the memory of Bishop Rademacher. When he took charge
							the diocese of Nashville was still suffering from the effects of the yellow-fever in
							Memphis, where so many priests and religious had fallen victims to that dreaded
							scourge. His humble, hard-working zeal in meeting the peculiar conditions that
							confronted him, his readiness to do missionary work, and help even the humblest in
							preaching, hearing confessions, attending sick-calls, even taking the place of his
							priests who might be absent on a much needed rest, soon won for the Bishop the
							affection and the esteem of priests and people. This bond of affection between Bishop
							Rademacher and the priests and people of his diocese grew and deepened with the years,
							as his amiable, modest character became known: so that one and all instinctively
							called him GOOD Bishop Rademacher. The peculiar circumstances following the yellow
							fever, coupled with the financial conditions then prevailing throughout the country,
							did not allow his zeal to find expression <pb id="VAB8203-048" n="48"/> in the
							erection of church buildings. But his holy life, good example, his kindness to priests
							laboring in small and scattered missions, his patience and forbearance with all who
							came in contact with him, have built up a spiritual edifice in which the name of GOOD
							Bishop Rademacher is enshrined, and which will last as long as the generation that
							knew him lives. All honor to his memory."</q></p>

					<p>On January 22, 1893, Bishop Dwenger was called to his reward. To the great joy of the
						clergy and laity of the diocese, Pope Leo XIII, by letters dated July 14, 1893,
						transferred Bishop Rademacher from Nashville to Fort Wayne. Having endeared himself to
						all, during his former residence among them, the entire population turned out to give
						him welcome, when on October 3, 1893, his solemn installation in the Cathedral at Fort
						Wayne took place. Father Brammer, Administrator of the diocese, addressing the Bishop at
						the entrance to the Cathedral said, among other things: <q>"Ever since the death of
							Bishop Dwenger, it has been the earnest wish of every Catholic in this diocese, that
							you would be made its Bishop. For this reason, and because we love and respect you,
							our welcome is all the heartier."</q> A most impressive reception took place on the
						evening of October 4th, but on the day following, the solemn installation and Pontifical
						Mass was celebrated at 9:30, with Bishop Rademacher as Celebrant, Very Rev. Joseph
						Brammer assistant priest, Revs. E. P. Walter and E. Koenig deacons of honor, Rev. John
						R. Quinlan deacon and Rev. C. B. Guendling subdeacon of the Mass, Rev. W. J. Quinlan,
						master of ceremonies, and Very Rev. William Corby, C. S. C., Rev. A. B. Oechtering,
						chaplains to Archbishop Elder. The Bulls of Pope Leo XIII were read by Rev. J. H.
						Hueser, D. D., after which the Archbishop escorted the Bishop to the throne. After this,
						each priest of the diocese in turn knelt before the Bishop, in token of submission
						kissing the Bishop's ring. The sermon on this occasion was preached by Bishop Foley of
						Detroit, whose text was: <q>"You have not chosen me, but I you. Go forth, therefore,
							into the world, teaching all men in my name, for lo, I am with you even unto the
							consummation of the world."</q> The prelates honoring the occasion with their presence
						were: Archbishop Katzer of Milwaukee, Archbishop Elder of Cincinnati, Bishop Maes of
						Covington, <pb id="VAB8203-049" n="49"/> Bishop Watterson of Columbus, Bishop Foley of
						Detroit, Bishop Horstmann of Cleveland, Bishop McCloskey of Louisville, Bishop Richter
						of Grand Rapids, Bishop Janssen of Belleville, Mgr. Thorpe V. G. of Cleveland, Mgr. Joos
						V. G. of Detroit and Mgr. Windthorst of Chillicothe, Ohio, the Vicars General Scheidler
						of Indianapolis and Albrinck of Cincinnati, Rev. G. F. Houck Chancellor of Cleveland,
						the Provincials Englert, O. F. M., Corby, C. S. C., Drees, C. PP. S. and Very Rev.
						Patrick Gleeson, Administrator of the diocese of Nashville. After the ceremonies, the
						clergy attended a banquet served in Library Hall.</p>

					<p>For five years, until the close of 1898, the diocese of Fort Wayne continued to
						flourish, under the gentle yet efficient administration of Bishop Rademacher. Most
						conscientious in the discharge of duty, and realizing fully the great responsibility
						resting upon him, he did not lose sight of a single important interest of the diocese.
						The happiness of his priests, and the welfare of the parishes, were uppermost in his
						mind and heart. It is noteworthy, that often times he had to undergo a severe struggle,
						when his gentle disposition on the one hand and imperative duty on the other, coming in
						conflict, demanded a decision. It was then, that Bishop Rademacher experienced more
						suffering and greater concern, than those immediately concerned.</p>

					<p>Churches multiplied, church properties improved, schools increased in number, and the
						work of education progressed most satisfactorily. He never failed to be present where
						his presence was required, and everywhere, all over the diocese, his influence for good
						was felt. It is to be regretted, that a beneficent administration like his was cut
						short, when human expectations were highest. It is needless, and altogether painful to
						record the circumstances under which the poor Bishop spent the last year of his life.
						The daily press at the time had this to say substantially on January 18, 1900: The
						Bishop's illness dates back something over a year. On returning from a visit at South
						Bend, the Bishop appeared worn and ill, and in a short time it became apparent, that he
						was bordering on a state of mental collapse. The physical break down followed, and
						within a few months, the once robust frame of the Bishop was but a sad reminder of the
						past. The patient was removed <pb id="VAB8203-050" n="50"/> to St. Joseph's Hospital, at
						Fort Wayne, where he remained for several months; after which he was taken to Chicago,
						and placed under the care of a specialist, for four months, at St. Elizabeth's hospital.
						When it was found that he was incurable, he was removed to Fort Wayne. It was on January
						12th, at 11:25 A. M., when Bishop Rademacher yielded up his spirit to his Creator. The
						news of his death was received with universal sadness, for the good Bishop had been well
						beloved by his people and esteemed and respected by all. The solemn funeral services
						took place on January 16th, and were participated in, by not only the clergy of the
						diocese, but also by the clergy from other parts, swelling the number of priests in
						attendance to fully three hundred. The church dignitaries, who by their presence gave
						testimony of their esteem for the deceased Bishop were: Archbishop Elder of Cincinnati,
						Archbishop Katzer of Milwaukee, Bishop Byrne of Nashville, Bishop Chatard of
						Indianapolis, Bishop Foley of Detroit, Bishop Horstmann of Cleveland, Bishop Janssen of
						Belleville, Bishop Maes of Covington, Bishop Richter of Grand Rapids, Bishop Scannell of
						Omaha, Archabbot Leander Schnerr, O. S. B., Abbot Edmund Obrecht, O. C. R., Abbot
						Athanasius Schmidt, O. S. B., Very Rev. M. J. Marseile, C. S. V., Very Rev. John B.
						Murray, President Mt. St. Mary's Seminary, Very Rev. Joseph Rainer, President St.
						Francis' Seminary, Very Rev. F. J. Baumgartner, V. G., Very Rev. D. O'Donaghue, V. G.
						After the recitation of the Office for the dead, by the assembled clergy at nine
						o'clock, the Pontifical Mass of Requiem was celebrated with Archbishop Elder as
						celebrant, Very Rev, John H. Guendling as Assistant Priest, Rev. John Bleckmann Deacon,
						Rev. John H, Bathe Subdeacon of the Mass, Rev. A. J. Morrissey and Rev. J. F. Delaney
						Deacons of Honor, Rev, W. J. Quinlan, Rev. C. B. Guendling and Rev. John Durham Masters
						of Ceremonies, Rev. P. J. O'Reilley and Rev. F. X. Labonte Acolytes, Rev. John F. Noll
						Book-bearer, Rev. P. J. Crawley Candle-bearer, Rev. A. E. Lafontaine Mitre-bearer, Rev.
						T. Mungovan Censer-bearer and Rev. J. C. Keller the Gremiale. The sermon was preached by
						Bishop Horstmann of Cleveland, an intimate friend of the deceased. His text was: <q>"My
							soul doth magnify the Lord and my spirit doth rejoice in God, my Saviour. He that is
							mighty hath done great things in me and <pb id="VAB8203-051" n="51"/> holy is His
							name. And His mercy is from generation to generation to them that fear Him. He hath
							received Israel His servant, being mindful of His mercy."</q>-- <bibl>Luke I.</bibl>
						The sermon was a thoughtful tribute to the memory of the dead Bishop, and an earnest
						request for the prayers of the faithful, especially of those who had been benefited by
						the life and labor of the third Bishop of the diocese of Fort Wayne.</p>

					<p>After the solemn absolution the remains were enclosed in a vault beneath the sanctuary
						of the Cathedral.</p>

					<p>The following touching tribute is quoted as characteristic: <q>
							<p>"Bishop Rademacher, when a priest, was sent to the little parish at Attica after
								his ordination, and also served the small missions Covington and Marshfield near by.
								The Covington church was the result of his personal work among the people, and in no
								less degree of his own sacrifices, for the Catholics thereabouts had little to give.
								The congregation was very small, and, much as they loved him for his humility and
								self sacrifice, they could not requite him properly in a money way. Whenever he
								announced that his salary was due, he would add, in almost the same breath, that if
								they needed this money for the necessaries of life not to worry about him he would
								try to get along as best he could. When he met with the poor he gave his last penny.
								One day a man came to him and said he was a painter, and if he only had a few
								dollars he could buy paint and brushes and thus get a job and escape starvation.
								Father Joseph had only two dollars which he handed the man, and, seeing that he was
								in need of a coat, gave him one of the two in his possession. Next day he found out
								that the man was a vagrant by choice and had imposed upon him. But Father Joseph was
								so honest and pure minded, said the witness of this scene, that he could not think
								otherwise of any man.</p>
							<p>"At the time Father Joseph was in Attica, the section boss of the Wabash railroad
								invited the priest to a Christmas dinner, and both the host and hostess observed,
								that their guest kept trying to hide his shoes, or they thought he did so. Watching
								him more closely the hostess noticed, that he had hardly any shoes at all on his
								feet. She said to her husband: They are only pieces and scraps of shoes tied and
								sewed together. Before the Father's departure his host gave him ten dollars, on
								condition that he should spend it on himself for <pb id="VAB8203-052" n="52"/>
								necessary clothing. They learned later, that he had given nearly all of his little
								store of clothing to a poor family, in which there were many children, and he
								thought their need was greater than his. Orphans, by the way, were his particular
								weakness, and long after his elevation to the Bishop's throne, he went among them
								with the simplicity of a parish priest.</p>
							<p>"He was a man of exquisite courtesy, so studiously careful of the feelings of
								others, that he made it the matter of conscience as important as his religious
								duties. No matter how much work he had to do, or how worried he was, he never was
								ill-humored. His people always rejoiced when they met him, or he came to their
								homes, for he was ever cheerful and had a wonderful smile for everyone. And he never
								wanted anyone to bother or worry about him.</p>
							<p>"What an epitaph for this prince of the church, whose tremendous activities were
								graced by so much simple gentleness."</p>

						<lb/>
						<hi rend="sc">THE RIGHT REV. HERMAN JOSEPH ALERDING, D. D.<lb/> THE FOURTH BISHOP OF
							FORT WAYNE.</hi>
					</head>

					<p>The present Bishop of Fort Wayne was born in Westphalia, on April 13, 1845. During his
						infancy, the family emigrated to America, and made their home in Newport, Kentucky. He
						attended the parochial schools of Corpus Christi Church. All the children of the parish,
						boys and girls, numbering about one hundred and fifty, were taught in one room, by one
						teacher. Scenes such as transpired there are wholly foreign to the present time. The
						education was in every respect strenuous. From his earliest boyhood days, he felt an
						inclination and a desire to become a priest. Encouraged by the Rev. John Voll, pastor of
						Corpus Christi Church, he received his first lessons in Latin from this zealous priest.
						He was sent to the diocesan seminary in Vincennes, Indiana, from 1858 till 1859. Bishop
						Carroll was unable to accept him, as a student for the diocese of Covington, and
						application having been made to Bishop de St. Palais, of Vincennes, he was adopted by
						that prelate for the diocese of Vincennes. The second year of his studies was spent in
						the old St. Thomas' Seminary, near Bardstown, Kentucky. In the fall of 1860, he was sent
						to St. Meinrad's College and Seminary in Spencer county, Indiana, which institution was
						conducted by Benedictine Fathers, who had come to this country from Einsiedlen,
						Switzerland. Here he finished his studies, and received the Holy Orders from Bishop de
						St. Palais; Tonsure and Minor Orders on September 18, 1865, Subdeaconship on June 18,
						1867, Deaconship on June 21st of the same year, and Priesthood on September 22,
						1868.</p>

					<p>His first appointment was that of assistant to the Rev. John B. Chasse at St. Joseph's
						Church, in Terre Haute, where he remained until October 18, 1871. While here, he had
						charge also of the missions Rockville and Montezuma, and the station Rosedale in Parke
						county, and of the mission Sullivan and the station Farmersburg, in Sullivan county. On
						October 18, 1871, he was removed to Cambridge City, where he was the <pb
							id="VAB8203-054" n="54"/> pastor of St. Elisabeth's Church, till August, 1874. Here he
						found a demoralized congregation, which had been interdicted for some six months, and
						was financially involved. After a time the debt was paid, but the location of the church
						was most objectionable. The following paper, by Bishop de St. Palais, will explain the
						condition of things, satisfactorily: <q>"In consideration of the circumstances, in which
							the congregation of Cambridge City is placed, and of the many sacrifices the members
							of said congregation, though small in number, have made to build up their church, and
							that, notwithstanding all their efforts to do so, they now, after years of struggle,
							find the same hemmed in on all sides by the newly constructed railroads, in such a
							manner, that divine service is thereby frequently disturbed, and consequently the
							necessity, of procuring a more suitable location for the House of God, is apparent; I,
							therefore, not only authorize the pastor of said congregation, the Rev. H. Alerding,
							to collect funds for this purpose, but I also herewith strongly recommend the Reverend
							Gentleman to the generous and charitable sympathies of all, on whom he may call for
							the furtherance of his laudable undertaking.-- Given at Vincennes under my seal and
							signature, July 14, 1873.-- Maurice de St. Palais, Bishop of Vincennes."</q> The
						generous support given Father Alerding enabled him, as already stated, to liquidate the
						indebtedness on the church property, and also to purchase a new site for a new church.
						While pastor at Cambridge City, he had charge also of the stations Knightstown and New
						Castle in Henry county and Hagerstown in Wayne county. The churches at Knightstown and
						New Castle were built by him and wholly paid for. It was during his pastorate, that
						Bishop de St. Palais visited all these places, and administered Confirmation.</p>

					<p>In 1873, the Rev. Joseph Petit had organized St. Joseph's Congregation, at
						Indianapolis, having erected a two story building on East Vermont street, which was to
						be church, school and pastoral residence. Father Petit resigned in 1874. Bishop de St.
						Palais built a roomy three story addition, to the structure erected by Father Petit, and
						made it St. Joseph's Seminary. It was at this juncture, in the summer of 1874, that
						Father Alerding was transferred to Indianapolis, and appointed to the position of
						procurator for the Seminary, and <pb id="VAB8203-055" n="55"/> pastor for the
						congregation, which continued to have regular services in the Seminary chapel. The
						Seminary continued for one year, and was then abandoned. Immediately upon the advent of
						Bishop Chatard to the diocese, Father Alerding was directed to build a new church in
						some other quarter, in order that the Bishop might use the old building as a hospital. A
						site was bought on the corner of North and Noble streets for $5,500, on which the
						present St. Joseph's Church was erected and was dedicated, on July 4, 1880. The church
						cost $25,000. A priest's house soon followed at the moderate cost of $2,500. At the
						instigation of the pastor, the Sisters of Providence erected the St. Joseph's Academy,
						south of the church. Later, a building, 100x50 feet, with four large school rooms on the
						first floor and the entire second floor for a hall, was erected. At the close of Father
						Alerding's pastorate a debt, not at all burdensome, remained upon the valuable church
						property.</p>

					<p>A red letter day in the history of St. Joseph's Church was September 22, 1893, when the
						congregation celebrated the Silver Jubilee of its organization, and the pastor the
						Silver Jubilee of his ordination to the priesthood. It was a day of joy and still lives
						in the memory of Father Alerding and his friends.</p>

					<p>In 1883, Father Alerding published "A History of the Catholic Church in the Diocese of
						Vincennes." In the preface Bishop Chatard says: <q>"It seems to me we all, of this
							diocese of Vincennes, owe a debt of gratitude to Rev. H. Alerding, on his successful
							completion of this history of the beginning of the Faith in our midst. It is to be
							regretted that not all corresponded to his request for information, owing, perhaps to
							want of information or documentary statements, or to press of occupation. As far as it
							goes, he has presented us a recital having the vividness of actual experience, and the
							reliability of an extract of records. The book is also a monument to his industry and
							untiring patience, in the midst of financial and parochial work, which might well have
							excused him from such an undertaking."</q></p>

					<p>The See of Fort Wayne becoming vacant upon the death of Bishop Rademacher, little did
						Father Alerding or his friends, or the diocesans of Fort Wayne dream that he would be
						the Fourth Bishop of the Diocese of Fort Wayne. Yet "BY THE <pb id="VAB8203-056" n="56"
						/> GRACE OF GOD AND THE FAVOR OF THE APOSTOLIC SEE" such was the case. The Bulls of
						appointment bearing the date of August 30, 1900, were placed in the hands of the
						Bishop-elect on September 27th, and the consecration took place on November 30th, of the
						same year. The consecration took place in the Cathedral, at Fort Wayne: Archbishop Elder
						of Cincinnati was the consecrator and Bishop O'Donaghue Auxiliary of Indianapolis and
						Bishop Moeller of Columbus, were the Assistant Bishops. Chaplains to Archbishop Elder
						were Revs. J. H. Oechtering, P. F. Roche and E. J. Wrobel. Chaplains to Bishop
						O'Donaghue, Revs. D. J. Mulcahy and William Schmidt. Chaplains to Bishop Moeller, Revs.
						John R. Dinnen and H. M. Plaster. Chaplains to the Bishop-elect, Revs. A. Morrissey, C.
						S. C. and John Bleckmann. The other prelates present were, Bishop McCloskey, of
						Louisville; Bishop Chatard, of Indianapolis, chaplain Rev. A. J. Kroeger; Bishop
						Richter, of Grand Rapids, chaplain Rev. H. F. Jos. Kroll; Bishop Maes, of Covington,
						chaplain Rev. R. Wurth, O. F. M.; Bishop Foley, of Detroit, chaplain Rev. A. B.
						Oechtering; Bishop Horstmann, of Cleveland, chaplain Rev. F. Nigsch, C. PP. S.; Bishop
						Byrne, of Nashville, chaplain Rev. M. J. Byrne. The priests taking part in the solemn
						ceremony were:-- Rev. G. Horstmann, cross-bearer; Rev. T. Mungovan, book-bearer; Rev. J.
						Schmitz, mitre-bearer; Rev. J. Walsh, gremiale; Rev. J. Tremmel, censer-bearer; Revs. F.
						X. Labonte and J. F. Noll, acolythes; Very Rev. J. H. Guendling, assistant priest; Revs.
						H. T. Wilken and J. F. Delaney, deacons of honor; Rev. H. Boeckelmann, deacon, and Rev.
						John R. Quinlan, sub-deacon of the Mass; Revs. W. J. Quinlan, J. P. Durham, A. E.
						Lafontaine and P. J. O'Reilley, masters of ceremonies; Revs. L. A. Moench and B.
						Boebner, C. PP. S., chanters, and Rev. J. H. Bathe, notary. The preacher on the occasion
						was the Rev. Joseph Chartrand, private secretary to Bishop Chatard.</p>

					<p>The following was Bishop Alerding's first pastoral letter: <text>
							<body>
								<div type="letter">

									<head>HERMAN JOSEPH, BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND FAVOR OF<lb/>
										<hi rend="center">THE APOSTOLIC SEE, BISHOP OF FORT WAYNE.</hi></head>

									<salute rend="i">To the Clergy and Laity of his diocese, greeting:--</salute>

									<p>"On this feast of St. Andrew, the thirtieth day of November, in the year of Our
										Lord, 1900, the day of my consecration <pb id="VAB8203-057" n="057"/> and
										elevation to the burden of the episcopate (Onus Episcopatus), I hasten to send
										you a word of greeting. You, the clergy, disinterested, self-sacrificing,
										zealous laborers in the Lord's vineyard, have done great and enduring deeds for
										God's glory and the salvation of souls. God's grace has been bountiful and your
										co-operation most generous. These premises given, the same glorious results are
										brought about at all times and in all places, as also in the diocese of Fort
										Wayne. The leadership of my predecessors in this favorite see, the Right Rev.
										John Henry Luers, the Right Rev. Joseph Dwenger, the Right Rev. Joseph
										Rademacher-not omitting the administration of Right Rev. Mgr. Julian
										Benoit,.Very Rev. Joseph H. Brammer and Very Rev. John H. Guendling-has pointed
										you upward and onward. Lofty generalship has been at the head of the devoted
										priests of this diocese, and what wonder, if the diocese of Fort Wayne,
										throughout its length and breadth, is well established and well ordered.</p>

									<p>"To you, the laity, whole-souled and devoted to your spiritual guides, shall be
										given merited recognition. The result of your generous devotedness to holy
										religion is apparent everywhere, throughout the diocese. You have furnished the
										means to erect the numerous and magnificent churches, evidences of a faith truly
										active; for, none but a practically Catholic head and heart will contribute
										generously, when the great cause demands it.</p>

									<p>"The diocese may be quoted as an example worthy of emulation in the great work
										of Catholic education. Priests and people are a unit in the establishing, the
										upholding and the regulating of the schools. A prosperous school means a
										prosperous parish, a poor school means a poor parish; no Catholic school means--
										I will not say-- means no parish, but your imagination may picture the dreary
										condition and- unpromising future of such a parish.</p>

									<p>"And, again, the different religious communities of men and women, laboring in
										charities of various kinds, dotting the diocese throughout with the evidences of
										prosperity and boundless zeal-- aye-- and that institution of institutions, upon
										which the fire-fiend laid his heavy hand hot less than four times in the current
										year, without causing this bulwark of faith and morals to waver even for a
										moment, in its great battles for <pb id="VAB8203-058" n="58"/> science and
										religion-- the University of Notre Dame. What a splendid record for the diocese
										of Fort Wayne.</p>

									<p>"Consecrated Chief Pastor of this diocese at the close of the ecclesiastical
										year 1900, and at the close, too, of the ecclesiastical nineteenth century; and
										looking back over all that has been accomplished in this diocese-- so briefly
										enumerated and so imperfectly withal-- need I tell you that my soul is all aglow
										with joy, trembling with gratitude to God.</p>

									<p>"But, dear brethren of the clergy, beloved children of the laity, what of the
										future, what of the twentieth century? Well, what of it? The clergy will
										continue to labor in the twentieth as they did in the nineteenth century; the
										laity will second the efforts of their priests in the twentieth as they did in
										the nineteenth century. The new Bishop has been sent by the Pope, the same as
										his three predecessors had been sent by the Pope. The Holy Ghost rules the
										Church today, and will do so till the end of time, the same as He has done from
										the beginning. Let us be convinced, that the new century has even greater things
										in store for the church than the glorious acquisitions bestowed in the
										nineteenth century.</p>

									<p>"Profoundly grateful to God for all His blessings upon our beloved diocese, let
										us beg Him to continue His vigilant care over us in the future. May the Holy
										Ghost descend upon your humble servant, enlighten his intellect that he may
										understand his duties, strengthen his will, that he may firmly adhere to what is
										right and just.</p>

									<closer>
										<salute>"May the blessing of Almighty God, of the Father ,and of the Son, and of
											the Holy Ghost, descend upon you, and remain always."-- The letter was dated

					<p>Bishop Alerding at once began to visit the various churches of his diocese, and has
						made it a rule to visit all of them at least once every three years.</p>

					<p>On September 30, 1903, he promulgated a Synod to be held on November 11th of the same
						year, in the Cathedral at Fort Wayne. The Synod was held and consisted of two sessions
						one in the forenoon, and one in the afternoon. The Statutes were officially published on
						March 19, 1904, and from that date were in full force. Among other things a new deanery
						was established, so that at present the diocese has six deaneries: <pb id="VAB8203-059"
							n="59"/> Fort Wayne, South Bend, Hammond, Logansport, Lafayette and Muncie. Heretofore
						each deanery was made to consist of certain parishes, but since the Synod each deanery
						consists of certain counties.</p>

					<p>Bishop Alerding was absent from his diocese from September 7 to November 15, 1905, to
						comply with his obligation of the "visitatio ad limina Apostolorum." The clergy made use
						of the occasion of his departure, as an opportunity to present to their Bishop an
						address, replete with good wishes and heartfelt prayers for his safe journey to Rome,
						and a safe return. Along with the address a generous purse, by the priests, was
						presented. His return on November 15th was greeted with unusual demonstration of joy by
						the people. The Cathedral was packed, the long entrance to it left no passage way, and
						Calhoun street was crowded the entire length of the Cathedral Square. Amid the ringing
						of bells and a grand exhibition of fireworks, thousands of people stood in the rain, to
						bid the Bishop welcome home with deafning cheers. Mr. W. J. Breen delivered an address
						of welcome, at the Cathedral entrance. Having reached the sanctuary the Bishop addressed
						the vast audience. From this address we quote one paragraph: <q>"When I knelt at the
							feet of the Supreme Pastor of the whole Church it seemed as if knelt there, every man,
							woman and child of the diocese of Fort Wayne. When I visited the great St. Peter's
							Cathedral, impressed with its vast proportions, I fancied I saw in the great sanctuary
							Pius the Tenth, in the full splendor of grandest church ceremonial, and kneeling there
							with me my eighty thousand and more diocesan children. Indeed the great Cathedral
							could accommodate them all."</q></p>

					<p>Bishop Alerding brought with him from Rome a large number of relics, to receive which,
						and to expose them for the veneration of the faithful, a place was prepared beneath the
						altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the Cathedral.</p>

						<head rend="center">1. THE RIGHT REV. MGR. JULIAN BENOIT, V. G.</head>


						<p>He was born in Septmoncel, a village in the great Jura mountain range, France, on
							October 17, 1808. He began his theological studies at the age of seventeen, and having
							completed these studies, he was ordained subdeacon and deacon, not having attained the
							required age for priesthood. He was so impressed with Bishop Brute's sanctity and
							learning, that he emigrated to America, on June 1, 1836. He was ordained priest, by
							Bishop Brute, at Mount St. Mary's Seminary, Baltimore, on St. Mark's day, 1837. His
							first appointment was at Leopold, near Evansville, Indiana. He was next sent to Rome,
							on the Ohio river, and then went to Chicago; from which place he also attended
							Lockport, Joliet and several other towns along the canal. After one year he returned
							to Leopold, spending there three and one-half years in hard missionary labor. During
							his stay at Leopold, he received a salary of $63.00.</p>

						<p>He was next sent to Fort Wayne, where he arrived on April 16, 1840. During the first
							six months, in Fort Wayne, he boarded with Francis Comparet. The church, at that time,
							was a frame structure rudely built, not plastered, 35x65 feet, with a few rough boards
							for benches. Father Benoit soon secured all the ground, known as Cathedral Square, and
							paid for it. His missionary field of labor comprised Lagro, Huntington, Columbia City,
							Warsaw, Goshen, Avilla, New France, New Haven, Besancon, Hesse Cassel and Decatur.
							With the exception of a few canal towns, these visits had all to be made on horseback.
							During sickly seasons Father Benoit underwent incredible hardships, on account of
							sick-calls as far as Muncie, Indiana, and Defiance, Ohio. In 1845, he brought three
							Sisters of Providence to Fort Wayne, where he gave them a house completely furnished,
							and, towards enlarging the building, he contributed $5,000, in 1883. He built the
							present brick <pb id="VAB8203-061" n="61"/> structure, on the corner of Jefferson and
							Clinton streets, for a school for boys. He also erected the first episcopal residence,
							the present clergy house, on Clinton street, at a cost of $16,000, mostly from his
							personal resources.</p>

						<p>Father Benoit visited New Orleans in 1853 and in 1860, soliciting funds for the
							building of the. Fort Wayne Cathedral. In the autumn of 1861, the Cathedral was
							dedicated, having cost, including furniture, about $60,000. Father Benoit visited
							Europe in 1841, in 1865, remaining there about thirteen months; and in 1874, as a
							member of the first American pilgrimage, remaining from May till September. These
							visits were made principally in the interests of the diocese of Fort Wayne. Many
							honors were bestowed on Father Benoit. He was made Vicar General of the diocese of
							Vincennes, in 1852, and of Fort Wayne, in 1858. During Bishop Luers' visit to Europe,
							in 1865, Father Benoit was Administrator of the diocese. At the Second Plenary Council
							of Baltimore, in 1866, he was the theologian of Bishop Luers. After the death of
							Bishop Luers, he was again Administrator of the diocese, from June, 1871, to April,
							1872. He attended the four Provincial Councils, at Cincinnati, as theologian to the
							Bishop. In 1883, he was again Administrator of the diocese, during Bishop Dwenger's
							absence in Rome. A Papal Brief of Leo XIII, bearing date of June 12, 1883, conferred
							upon Father Benoit the honors and title of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness. The
							investiture took place in the Cathedral, on August 16th, of the same year.</p>

						<p>Father Benoit's interest in, and labors among, the Indians remains to be recorded.
							Remnants of the old Fort Wayne and the Council House of the Miami Indians, on East
							Main street, still stood when Father Benoit came. He proved a true friend and
							protector of the poor Indians, in their transactions with the United States
							government, and the post-traders. In 1848, the Indians received orders from the
							government to leave their reservations about Fort Wayne, and go to the territory
							assigned them in Kansas. They numbered about 800, and were led by Chief Lafontaine,
							whom, together with his wife and children, Father Benoit had received into the Church.
							The Indians, however, refused to leave, unless Father Benoit would go with them. The
							government sent on some <pb id="VAB8203-062" n="62"/> troops, and the captain, calling
							on Father Benoit, begged of him to lead the Indians away peaceably. Upon these
							representations Father Benoit secured the services of Father Neyron, the only survivor
							of the band of twenty-two priests, that came to Indiana with him, and started on his
							tour, to please the Indians and prevent bloodshed. The tribe started overland, in the
							summer of 1849, and Father Benoit went by canalboat to Cincinnati, thence over the
							Ohio and Mississippi to St. Louis, where he took the stage for the present Kansas
							City. He finally reached the reservation, marked out for the Indians by the
							government, and remained in the encampment with his beloved children of the forest,
							about two weeks. He returned home by stage the entire route, travelling nine days and
							nights in one continuous trip. Out of six persons in the group, he was the only one to
							endure the hardships of the trip in one continuous journey.</p>

						<p>Father Benoit's health began to fail, and when Bishop Dwenger returned from the
							Baltimore Council, in 1884, he found him complaining of a severe pain in his throat.
							Three leading physicians were called in, and pronounced his ailment to be cancer of
							the throat. Father Benoit recognized, that his remaining days on earth were few, and,
							with characteristic resignation, he remarked: <q>"If Providence desires to take me by
								the throat, then God's will be done."</q> An altar was erected in his room, and on
							Sunday morning, January 11, 1885, he offered the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, for the
							last time. He suffered intensely, but he bore all in calm resignation to God's will.
							On Monday evening, January 26, 1885, having received all the consolations of religion,
							the heroic soul of the apostolic Father Benoit passed away. His remains rest in the
							Crypt of the Cathedral.</p>

						<head rend="center">2. THE RIGHT REV. MGR. JOHN H. OECHTERING, V. G.</head>

						<p>He was born December 23, 1845, at Lingen, Hanover, Germany, a son of Clement and Mary
							(Grotemeier) Oechtering. He attended the schools of his native city until twelve years
							of age, after which he spent two years at the Gymnasium, a school for the higher
							branches of literature and science, in the same <pb id="VAB8203-063" n="63"/> city of
							Lingen. In 1858, he was sent to college in Munster and remained seven years, after
							which he spent two years at the University in the same city. In 1867, he entered the
							American College of Louvain, Belgium, as a candidate for the priesthood. He was
							ordained for the diocese of Fort Wayne, by the Co-adjutor Archbishop of Malines, May
							21, 1869. Mgr. Oechtering came to America the same year, and was assigned to Elkhart,
							residing, however, at Mishawaka. He had charge of Elkhart one year, when he was
							transferred to St. Joseph's Church at Laporte, where he remained ten years. As pastor
							of St. Joseph's Church at Laporte he also attended Otis. On July 14, 1880, he was
							appointed pastor of St. Mary's Church, Fort Wayne. For an account of Mgr. Oechtering's
							pastoral labors the reader is referred to the history of St. Joseph's Church, at
							Laporte, of Otis, and of St. Mary's Church at Fort Wayne. In 1888, he was named
							irremovable rector of the same church by Bishop Dwenger; in 1903, Vicar General of the
							diocese of Fort Wayne by Bishop Alerding; and in 1905, Domestic Prelate of His
							Holiness, Pope Pius X. Mgr. Oechtering is a ripe scholar: noted for several treatises
							of merit on Capital and Labor, Socialism, not to omit a number of dramas much admired
							for their original conception and classical finish. The titles of these dramas are:
							Hermenegild, William Tell, and King Saul; a comedy: The Living Statue, and a farce:
							the Discovery of America. His Catechism of Church History for the higher grades of
							Catholic schools is doing good service to religion and bids fair, when better known,
							to be introduced in schools everywhere. Mgr. Oechtering is the Judge of the
							Matrimonial Court, Moderator of the Fort Wayne Deanery, Synodal Examiner and President

						<hi rend="sc">THE CLERGY, DIOCESAN AND REGULAR.</hi>
					</head>

					<p>The list of names given in this chapter presents, in alphabetical order, the names of
						priests, who have performed pastoral functions in this diocese, from about 1669, till
						the present time: covering a period of fully two and one-third centuries. The diocesan
						clergy is numerically the strongest, but there are also many members of the C. S. C.,
						the C. PP. S., the O. F. M., the O. S. B., and the S. J. A considerable number of these,
						both diocesan and regular, were transient only, but their names must not be omitted from
						the role of honor though, in a number of cases, the names could not be traced beyond a
						mere mention; and these will be found, in their order, in the index for reference.</p>

					<p>For obvious reasons, these biographical sketches are brief. What is beyond the full
						name, the place and time of birth, the studies, the ordinations, the various
						appointments, and some incidents of a personal nature, must be looked for under the
						heads of parishes, to which they were assigned. Some estimate of the character and
						labors of deceased priests has been attempted, but with regard to priests, still living,
						the facts are simply stated without comment. God alone can judge and weigh the life of a
						priest, in the many details of multifarious duties, at the altar, in the pulpit, in the
						confessional, in the baptistry, at the bedside of the dying, in the school, in manifold
						spiritual ministrations in the church, in his own house, in the homes of his
						parishoners; not to mention the most arduous task of regulating the finances of the
						church property, with all that this duty implies, of collecting and administering the
						offerings of the faithful, in the interests of the parish.</p>

					<p>We have before us three letters of the Rev. Stephen. Theodore Badin, addressed to the
						"Right Rev. Doctor Purcell, Athenaeum, Cincinnati." They illustrate forcibly the labors
						incident to a pastoral and missionary life, and coming from the first priest ordained in
						the United States, will serve as introductory to the biographies here presented.</p>

									<p>"The date of this letter reminds me that this day 42 years ago, the 1st Bishop
										of Baltimore ordained the first sub-deacon of his Diocese, and gave the tonsure
										and minor orders to 3 or 4 ordinandi.-- Time has brought many changes and
										ameliorations, or rather the Divine Pastor has given an incalculable increase to
										the sheep and lambs. There were then about 30 priests in the U. S. <milestone
											unit="typography" n="* * *"/> My intention, when I left home 12 days ago, was
										to answer the honor of your invitation. But first, we have many sick people
										along the canal lines. Second, when I am in Logansport at the mouth of Eel river
										(into the Wabash) the shortest road to Louisville, where my own affairs call me,
										will be by Indianapolis. Third, I have been informed by the Catholic Herald that
										the consecration of the excellent Bishop of Vincennes is to take place on the
										first Sunday of October in Bardstown, where most probably I will have the
										opportunity of seeing you. In fine I may return by Cincinnati-- for I have not
										money for traveling expenses.</p>

									<p>"In consequence of more than one considerable wrong done me I am reduced to
										distress, am in debt, received no salary, and withal have spent considerable
										sums to establish the Church in these backwoods. I speak not of labors,
										privations. My trust is in Divine Providence, which fails not. <milestone
											unit="typography" n="* * *"/></p>

									<p>"To serve you it would be gratifying to me to extend my <pb id="VAB8203-067"
											n="67"/> labors to the N. W. of your diocese, but the above date of my
										ordination has already informed you that I am more than 66 years of age, and
										considering that I do ride almost incessantly to attend 5 congregations on three
										lines of about 80 miles each, it would prove a deception and a presumption to
										attempt more than I do at present. Indeed I am compelled from debility to use
										many precautions, which I disregarded in former periods of life.</p>

									<p>"It may happen that Divine providence will not permit me to see the Angel of
										Vincennes. I had intended to write to congratulate him and his Diocese on his
										promotion, which has filled me with consolations; but having been made uncertain
										of the place and time where and when he was to be consecrated, and being often
										destitute either of time or even of conveniences in the miserable, crowded
										cabins where I must lodge in traveling, feeling also frequent fatigues, I have
										not yet satisfied my heart in presenting him my best respects, and in assuring
										him in my readiness to cooperate with and assist him in his exertions to
										establish and extend the kingdom of God in his new Diocese; wherefor I beg of
										you the favor to communicate these lines to him."</p>

									<p>Having mentioned the Irish, the Canadians and the French, Father Badin
										continues: "As to the Indians, the greater number of them being Christians, are
										on the boarders of Michigan, under the direction of the excellent priest, Mons.
										de Seille. He made this summer two excursions among the Pottawottamies of
										Tippecanoe river and baptised 76 of them the first Sunday of May, and 60 more
										the first Sunday of this month. The Pottawottamies of Michigan have sold all
										their land, and must emigrate within two years, but those of Tippecanoe have
										retained their Reserves of land, and may form a Catholic mission in the Diocese
										of Vincennes. The Indians are our best congregations.-- Town lots have been
										procured in five or six different places, viz. South Bend (one and a half miles
										from my establishment on St. Joseph river), Fort Wayne, Huntington, Wabash and
										Logansport. Three years ago I obtained also of Judge Hood two acres in the town
										of Peru, and prevailed on him to make his offer to Bishop Flaget; but as he did
										not answer the polite letter, and lots have become very valuable at Peru, there
										will perhaps be a demur. I caused the lot of Huntington to <pb id="VAB8203-068"
											n="68"/> be deeded to Bishop Flaget-- but the donor of eleven acres in Wabash,
										being a friend of mine, preferred to give me his obligation for the same and I
										did not insist otherwise from motives of politeness and prudence.</p>

									<p>"Our resources must be in the education of youth. Mr. Comparet estimates that
										the congregation in and about Fort Wayne must amount to 100 families. Prevailing
										sickness and mortality, the absence of pastor and poverty have prevented the
										forwarding of church affairs. No time should be lost in forwarding the erection
										of chapels along the canal line, because as soon as the work is done in one
										section of the country the Catholic hands move to another section, and the
										prospect of such erections diminishes or vanishes.-- This has been evidenced in
										Fort Wayne: the timber alone has been secured. There should be two priests
										riding constantly every week along a line of 80 miles. They should be active,
										pious, learned and disinterested, courageous and mortified. <milestone

						<p>Father Brammer organized the St. Vincent de Paul Society in the Cathedral parish. He
							loved all men of whatever color, race or creed; he saw in everyone the image of God, a

							borrowed money to assist the poor.</p>

						<p>It can be said of him, that he took the deepest interest in the welfare and
							advancement of the Cathedral schools: he loved children with a special affection.</p>

						<p>The continuous and arduous labors of Father Brammer gradually undermined his health,
							and for several years he was far from being well. His declining health only served to
							make him center his thoughts on the hereafter. His strength failed him from day to
							day, until having received the Last Sacraments, while yet in complete possession of
							his faculties, he surrendered his soul into the keeping of his Maker on Monday June
							20, 1898. His remains rest in the Crypt of the Cathedral.</p>

						<head rend="center">THE REV. LOUIS DE SEILLE.</head>

						<p>He was a native of Belgium, a descendant of one of the oldest and wealthiest families
							of that Country, near Sleidinge. His missionary labors in Indiana date, from 1832 to
							1837. His missions embraced portions of Indiana, Michigan and Illinois. To travel
							sixty or eighty miles to answer a sick call, was a common occurrence with him. Little
							is known as to particulars of his labors, but his death and its circumstances must be
							mentioned. He was visiting Pokegan, at a distance of about thirty-five miles from
							Notre Dame, for two weeks, when on leaving he told his dear Indians that they would
							not see him again. "I have a great journey to perform," he said to them, "pray for me
							and do not forget to say your beads for me". <pb id="VAB8203-176" n="176"/> Returning
							to Notre Dame, he sent messengers to Chicago and Logansport, a distance respectively
							of eighty-six and sixty-six miles, to have a priest come to attend him in his dying
							hour. After three days, the messenger returned without a priest. The house in which he
							lived was a log shanty divided into two parts, one of which served as a chapel, the
							other as a sleeping room. Father de Seille now requested to be carried into the
							adjoining chapel. Resting in the arms of his faithful Indians and having spent some
							time in prayer at the foot of the altar, he directed his attendant to vest him in
							surplice and stole. They raised him gently and supported the dying priest, who with
							trembling hand opened the tabernacle and drew forth the ciborium. Having uncovered it,
							he humbly and devoutly administered to himself the Holy Viaticum. After spending a
							long time in thanksgiving he was carried back to the adjoining room, where in less
							than a half an hour, invoking the sweet names of Jesus and Mary, with a calm smile on
							his countenance, he expired without a struggle. The poor Indians at Pokegan, impressed
							with what their Black Gown had told them, that they would not see him again, set out
							for Notre Dame. When they arrived Father de Seille was no more. For three days they
							stood in mourning around the bed of death. They refused to bury the dead priest and
							did so only when ordered by the authorities of the neighboring town. The body was
							interred in the little chapel, but it and the bodies of two other missionaries now
							rest in a vault beneath the sanctuary of the present magnificent church. A cross was
							erected on the spot where the log cabin stood with the following inscription: <q>"Hic
								praesens locus semel et iterum sanctificatus est oblatione divini sacraficii etiam
								per quosdam antecessorum nostrorum. Scimus procerto quod venerabilis de Seille rem
								sacram haberet aliquando in hoc humili suo cubiculo. Ibi moriens propriis manibus se
								communicavit in absentia alius sacerdotis quem in vanum desiderabat. Ibi mortuus et
								sepultus piis amicis traditus est in humili capella quae postea labore et arte in
								hanc praesentem ecclesiam pulcherrimam mutata est ob quam causam haec loca quasi
								fundamenta Ecclesiae Nostrae Domini inservientia omni veneratione religiosa digna
								videntur."</q> The memorial tablet in the wall of the church reads: <pb

						<p><q>"Father de Seille is described as a man of grave and reserved manner. His long

								face, though youthful, bore the traces of suffering and the marks of years;
								abstinence was written on his brow, and his downcast eye accorded with his meek

							two wealthiest men in the neighborhood died penniless, as he said they would, and that
							a wooden cross erected by him was never touched by fire, although every thing about it
							was burnt two or three times, the Indians asserting that he foretold, it would never

						<p>The first church, not only at Notre Dame but in the diocese of Fort Wayne, was a log
							chapel erected by Rev. Stephen Theodore Badin, as early as 1831. At that time it was
							known as the "Indian Chapel," and was the center of Father Badin's missionary
							activities throughout Northern Indiana and Southern Michigan. It was located on the
							south edge of St. Mary's lake. Having been destroyed by fire in 1856, a facsimile of
							it was erected recently, and the remains of Father Badin are buried in it. White
							settlers from the earliest days worshipped in this chapel and the present Sacred Heart
							Congregation has the extraordinary privilege of having for their church the
							magnificent Sacred Heart Church of Norte Dame. The number of families, however, is
							small being only fifty-eight in number, or two hundred and ninety two souls. The
							pastor of the congregation, at the present time, is Rev. M. A. McGarry, C. S. C., D.
							D.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-201" n="201"/>

						<p>Father Badin had blessed a tract of land, about a mile north of South Bend, between
							the upper Niles road and the river, known as the "Old Indian Grave-yard," for a
							cemetery. This location was looked upon as not desirable, and when Father Sorin
							arrived, in 1842, he laid out the present cemetery on Notre Dame avenue, half way
							between Notre Dame and South Bend. Brother Francis, C. S. C., had charge of this
							cemetery, and when, some years later, his favorite evergreens gave it a sightly
							appearance, he called it Cedar Grove cemetery. In 1842, it formed but a small corner,
							but it now extends over twenty-five acres, and is being enlarged year after year. In
							the early days, Cedar Grove was the only graveyard for Catholics within many miles of
							South Bend, and for this reason, even at this day, corpses are brought from great
							distances, to be buried by the side of relatives and friends, who are interred
							there.</p>

						<q rend="blockquote">
							<p>"The old Jesuit missionaries that may have visited Fort Wayne, when it was a mere
								trading post, have left here no record of their labors. The few Catholics that
								resided here were visited, for the first time on record, on the 3rd, of June, 1830,
								by Very Rev. Stephen Theodore Badin, the first priest ordained in the United States.
								He was then Vicar General of the dioceses of Bardstown, Kentucky, and Cincinnati,
								Ohio. At that time the State of Indiana was within the limits of the diocese of
								Bardstown. Father Badin repeated his visits to Fort Wayne in 1831, offered the Holy
								Sacrifice of the Mass and preached in the residence of Francis Comparet, and, in
								1832, when he performed the functions of his ministry in the residence of John
								Bequette.</p>
							<p>"The next priest who visited this city was Rev. L. Picot, then pastor at Vincennes,
								September 25, 1832. Then Father Badin was again in Fort Wayne December 25, 1832.
								Rev. Boheme also in 1832. Father Badin again in 1833 and 1834. Rev. Simon P.
								Lalumiere, pastor at Terre Haute, visited Fort <pb id="VAB8203-202" n="202"/> Wayne
								in 1835. Rev. Felix Matthew Ruff in 1835. Rev. J. F. Terrooren in 1835. Rev. John
								Claudius Francois, stationed at Logansport, visited Fort Wayne in January, February,
								May, June, July and August, 1836.</p>
							<p>"The first priest permanently appointed pastor of Fort Wayne was Rev. Louis
								Mueller, who took possession in August, 1836, and remained until the 16th, of April,
								1840. In 1838 Fort Wayne was visited by Bishop Brute. In the beginning of 1840
								Bishop Hailandiere appointed Rev. Julian Benoit pastor of St. Augustine's Church,
								Fort Wayne, having to attend (as missions) Lagro, Huntington, Columbia City, Warsaw,
								Goshen, Avilla, New France, New Haven, Besancon, Hesse Cassel and Decatur. His first
								assistant was Rev. Joseph Hamion, a saintly young priest, who died at Logansport in
								the early part of 1842. His second assistant was Rev. Joseph Rudolph, who died in
								Oldenburg, Franklin county, Indiana, after many years of hard missionary labors. His
								third assistant was Rev. F. A. Carius, who remained but a short time. The fourth was
								Rev. Alphonse Munschina, afterwards pastor at Lanesville, Indiana. The fifth was
								Rev. Edward Faller, who is now in the diocese of Vincennes. In 1849 the German
								portion of St. Augustine's congregation built a church and school-house, forming the
								first German speaking congregation in Fort Wayne, St. Mary's, of which Father Faller
								was made the first pastor."-- (Father Benoit in History of Allen County.)</p>
						</q>

						<p>The first undertaking of Father Benoit was the finishing of the church which had been
							begun by his predecessor. He very soon after erected school-houses, and secured the
							Sisters of Providence, and the Brothers of the Holy Cross, to take charge of these
							schools.</p>

						<p>The Right Rev. John H. Luers, who was appointed the first bishop of Fort Wayne, took
							up his residence in Fort Wayne, soon after his consecration, which took place on
							January 10, 1858. He died June 29, 1871.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-203" n="203"/>

						<p>The first church in Fort Wayne was a small frame structure, erected in 1837, on the
							site of the present Cathedral and was known as St. Augustine's Church. In 1859 this
							first church was moved to the east side of the Cathedral Square, facing on Clinton
							street, but was shortly after destroyed by fire. In the same year, 1859, the present
							Cathedral was erected at a cost of about $54,000. The greater part of this money was
							collected by Father Benoit, while on a visit to New Orleans. The organ, pews and other
							furniture cost over $9,000. The episcopal residence was erected by Father Benoit, at a
							cost of $16,000, paid from his own resources.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house stood on the corner of Calhoun and Lewis streets. It was
							erected by Rev. A. Bessonies, who was pastor of St. Augustine's Church in 1853 and
							1854, during Father Benoit's sojourn in New Orleans.</p>

						<p>The imposing building on Cathedral Square, known as Library Hall, was erected in
							1880, under the management of Father Brammer. It was he, who secured a huge block of
							Irish marble, which forms the corner stone of this building.</p>

						<p>In 1896 the Cathedral underwent a thorough restoration, at a cost of about $50,000.
							This work also was superintended by Father Brammer.</p>

						<p>In 1901, the first year of Bishop Alerding's administration, the Bishop's House, on
							the corner of Lewis and Clinton streets, was erected. The necessary funds were secured
							from the sale of the old Cemetery grounds, near Fort Wayne, and of a farm, in Jasper
							county.</p>

						<p>In 1906 a Crypt, for the burial of church dignitaries, was constructed beneath the
							sanctuary at an expense of over $1,000. In 1907 two entrances, in addition to the main
							entrance, for the convenience of the parish, and adding much to the appearance of the
							building, were made at a cost of over $2,500.</p>

						<p>The parish has five hundred and seventy-five families, numbering two thousand and
							seven hundred souls. The schools taught by four Brothers of the Holy Cross, and
							sixteen Sisters of Providence, are attended by six hundred and seven pupils. During
							Rev. P. F. Roche's pastorate a number of improvements and many repairs were made, and
							$30,000 of the debt on the Cathedral property paid, reducing the same to less than
							$60,000.</p>

						<p>The societies are: The Sodality of the Blessed Virgin for married men with one

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">LAGRO.</hi><lb/> ST. PATRICK'S CHURCH.<lb/>
							1838.</head>

						<p>Jesuit Missionaries, on their way from Montreal, Canada, to post Vincennes, visited
							Lagro as early as 1800. The venerable missionary, Father Badin, stopped there, in
							1833, on his way from Fort Wayne to Logansport. The construction of the Wabash and
							Erie Canal, in 1837, opened up a general traffic, and Lagro became the chief shipping
							center for wheat, corn and other crops. A number of families, of whom many were Irish
							Catholic, came from the east to make Lagro and its vicinity their home.</p>

						<p>Lagro has no church records prior to 1846, but such names as: de St. Palais, Benoit,
							Clark, and Franciscans, are frequently mentioned. It was in 1838, when Thomas
							Fitzgibbon donated two lots, and a frame church, 30x40 feet was erected. Beginning
							with the year 1846, we have the following names of clergymen, who attended to the
							spiritual wants of St. Patrick's Congregation: <list type="ordered">
								<item n="1."> Rev. Patrick McDermott, from May 24, 1846, to August 27, 1847.</item>
								<item n="2."> Rev. Michael C. O'Flannigan, from September 12, 1847, to August 8,
									1848.</item>
								<item n="3."> Rev. John Ryan, from September 9, 1848 to January 1865, who built an
									addition of 30x40 feet to the church. The church having now the dimensions of
									60x40 feet. He had charge also of the missions, Huntington, Wabash, Warsaw and
									Pierceton. On November 20, 1857 he bought two acres of land for cemetery
									purposes.</item>
								<item n="4."> Rev. Bernard Kroeger from January to September 1866, who bought the
									old priest's house for $1,000.</item>
								<item n="5."> Rev. George Steiner, from September 1, 1866 until August 1, 1868.
									During his absence on a collecting tour for the Orphan Asylums, from September 25
									until December 22, 1866, Rev. J. A. Winter supplied his place. Father Steiner
									bought a frame house for $200, and opened in it the first parochial school, with
									Julia Cannon, the teacher.</item>

								<pb id="VAB8203-209" n="209"/>

								<item n="6."> Rev. Matthew E. Campion, from August 3, 1868 until October 1, 1873,
									who built the present brick church, with a frontage of 50 feet, a depth of 114
									feet, and a height from floor to ceiling of 38 feet, having a seating capacity of
									600. The corner stone was laid by Bishop Luers, on June 15, 1870. The church being
									under roof September 1, 1872, a fair was held in it netting the handsome amount of
									$1,600. Bishop Dwenger dedicated the church, on March 17, 1873. This was the most
									flourishing period in the history of Lagro. The number of souls, belonging to St.
									Patrick's Church, was 300 families. At the present writing St. Patrick's has lost
									much of its prestige, as may appear from the following comparative statements: In
									1870, forty-five baptisms, in 1906 five; in 1870, marriages sixteen, in 1906 none;
									in 1870 deaths eighteen, in 1906 two.</item>
								<item n="7."> Rev. John Grogan, from October 1, 1873, until March 1, 1882, who
									placed oak pews in the church, a stairway to the gallery, a most ornamental
									communion railing of black walnut, a handsome pulpit, confessional, baptismal font
									and, besides all this, had the church frescoed. The total cost of the church with
									furnishings was more than $20,000, all cash paid.</item>
								<item n="8."> Rev. M. F. Kelly, from April 20, 1882 until January 1884.</item>
								<item n="9."> Rev. Patrick F. Roche, from February 3, 1884 until August 24, 1888,
									who purchased the pipe organ, for $700.</item>
								<item n="10."> Rev. Anthony J. Kroeger, from August 28, 1888 until June 1, 1890, who
									reopened the school in the old frame church, and secured the Sisters of St.
									Francis of Lafayette, as teachers. He also built the church in Andrews.</item>
								<item n="11."> Rev. Jeremiah Quinlan, from June 1890, until July 1891.</item>
								<item n="12."> Rev. John Tremmel, from July to August 1891.</item>
								<item n="13."> Rev. Julius Becks, from August 1891 till August 1894.</item>
								<item n="14."> Rev. G. M. Kelly, from August 29, 1894 till November 1895.</item>
								<item n="15."> Rev. Michael Hanly, from December 1, 1895, until December 27,
									1897.</item>
								<item n="16."> Rev. Peter Joseph Quinn, pastor since January 1, 1898.</item>
							</list>
						</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-210" n="210"/>

						<p>Father Quinn found the church property sorely in need of repairs. He expended over
							$2,000 for this purpose. The lots on the cemetery having been sold, he purchased the
							adjoining five acres, inclosing the same with an iron fence, entailing an expense of
							about $600. In 1904, Father Quinn built a parochial residence, with modern
							improvements, at a cost of about $4,000. The present indebtedness of the congregation
							is $125. The number of souls is 250, or forty families, most of whom live in the
							surrounding country.</p>

						<p>St. Patrick's Church has the following societies: The Rosary Society, organized about
							the year 1858; St. Patrick's Total Abstinence Society, also of an early date; the
							League of the Sacred Heart; the Young Ladies' Sodality, and the St. Aloysius'
							Sodality. Aside from their spiritual purposes, these societies assist the pastor in
							temporal affairs.</p>

						<p>One boy of the parish became a priest, and four girls have entered the religious
							life.</p>

						<p>It is asserted by those, who seem to know, that the bell, hanging in St. Patrick's
							Church tower, is the first bell to have swung its sweet sound over the Wabash valley.
							It was purchased during the pastorate of Father Ryan and everybody, Catholic or
							non-Catholic, contributed toward it. It was not an easy matter to ship that bell to
							Lagro. A young man, named Pasque, drove to Toledo with a yoke of oxen. Here he waited
							for two weeks in vain and concluded to go on to Buffalo, where he found the bell. In
							the meantime the citizens of Lagro became uneasy, wondering what could have happened
							to Pasque, and why the bell did not come. At last, one fine morning, the old ox team
							plodded into town with the bell on the wagon. It was a great day for Lagro. There was
							shouting and singing and procession and hurrah, until the bell was ringing in the
							tower. That bell now hangs in the tower of the present St. Patrick's Church. The
							oldest inhabitant of Lagro says: <q>"I don't believe I would be happy if I didn't hear
								old St. Patrick's bell. That old bell has rung for children that have grown old, and
								it has tolled lots of old friends of mine into the cemetery up there."</q> The bell
							has a clear sweet tone and citizens of Lagro say, they have heard its peal nine miles
							distant from the town.</p>

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">LOGANSPORT.</hi><lb/> ST. VINCENT DE PAUL'S
							CHURCH.<lb/> 1838.</head>

						<p>The history of St. Vincent de Paul's Congregation begins about the year 1838. The
							members, at that time, were made up mainly of laborers engaged in the construction of
							the Wabash and Erie canal, through this section of the country. Previous to that time,
							the few Catholics at Logansport were attended by missionaries, who travelled up and
							down the Wabash Valley, in their missionary work.</p>

						<p>In the year 1838, the Rev. John Claude Francois made the first effort to establish a
							permanent place of worship. He purchased five acres of land reserved to the children
							of Joseph Barrow, by a treaty with the Pottawottamies; later, making still other
							purchases, until a total of over twenty-three acres had been secured. On this land he
							erected a story-and-a-half log structure, to serve the purposes both of a church and a
							pastoral residence. The congregation increasing rapidly, Father Francois found it
							necessary to secure better accommodations, and within a year erected a sufficiently
							large church, on Duret street, which supplied the needs of the congregation for
							several years, from 1842 to 1861.</p>

						<p>In the year 1860, lots 151, 152, 153 and 154, in John Tipton's addition to the town
							of Logansport, fronting on Spencer street, were secured, together with pieces of
							ground between these lots and the Wabash and Erie canal. Upon this site, the present
							St. Vincent de Paul's Church was begun, by the laying of the cornerstone in 1860, and
							its completion and dedication in 1863. At this time, the Rev. George A. Hamilton was
							the pastor. The church is in the Gothic style of architecture. In the year 1888,
							Father Campion built an addition to the church, at a cost of $11,500. The twenty-three
							acres mentioned above, on which the original church was located, were sold during the
							pastorate of Father Hamilton. The interior of St. Vincent de Paul's Church is
							beautifully finished. The present pastor, Rev. P. J. Crosson, has made many
							improvements including the frescoing of the interior of the church, for $1,200; the
							placing of opulescent stained glass in the windows, <pb id="VAB8203-212" n="212"/> for
							$2,000, a steam heating plant, for $2,400. The seating capacity of the church is 700.
							The church property has a debt on it of $6,200.</p>

						<p>The parochial schools were taught by lay teachers, until the year 1865, when the
							Sisters of the Holy Cross took charge. As early as 1850, though for a short time only,
							school was taught in the old stone church on Canal street. From 1863, the second
							parochial school was opened in the Cullom building, on Second and Market streets,
							where the Sisters of the Holy Cross began to have charge. The present large,
							three-story brick school was erected in 1868, at a cost of $18,000. The study halls
							and class rooms are well furnished. The third story of the building is a large hall,
							giving ample room for school and other entertainments. This school possesses a bell of
							historical interest. It was purchased by Father de St. Palais, afterwards Bishop of
							Vincennes, on occasion of his visit to Paris, in 1845. It was cast under his special
							supervision, and was presented by him to St. Vincent de Paul's Church.</p>

						<p>What is now Holy Angels' Academy, was formerly known as the Walker property, and was
							secured in the year 1871, for a consideration of $18,000. Many alterations were made
							in the building, to make it answer the purpose for which it is now used. The Sisters
							of the Holy Cross also reside in this building and from here attend the boys' school
							on the church grounds. A course of eight grades is given the boys and a full high
							school course the girls; although if desired the boys are also taught bookkeeping,
							typewriting and stenography. Ten Sisters have charge of 250 children.</p>

						<p>The pastoral residence is a two-story brick building, adjacent to the church, on the
							east side. It was erected in the year 1879, during the pastorate of Father Walters, at
							a cost of $5,000. The small, frame house, which formerly stood here, was sold and
							removed to Thirteenth street. Additions to the house, with repairs and improvements,
							including a hot water plant, done since Father Crosson's advent, amount to $4,700.</p>

						<p>The following is an authentic list of the pastors of St. Vincent's Church: Rev. John
							Claude Francois, from 1838 to 1841; Rev. August Mary Martin, from 1841 to 1844; Rev.
								<pb id="VAB8203-213" n="213"/> Michael J. Clark, in 1844; Rev. Maurice de St.

							from May 1878 to June 1883; Rev. Matthew E. Campion, from June 1883 to December 1899;
							Rev. Patrick J. Crosson, since February 1900.</p>

						<p>St. Vincent's is one of the irremovable rectorates of the diocese. It has 270
							families, numbering 1215 souls.</p>

						<p>This parish has the Sodality of the Living Rosary and the Children of Mary; The
							League of the Sacred Heart; The St. Vincent's Cadets and Total Abstinence Society, and
							the Catholic Benevolent Legion.</p>

						<p>Three boys of this congregation have become priests, and twelve girls have entered
							religious communities.</p>

						<p>The Church of the Immaculate Conception at Woodville, is visited from St. Vincent's
							Church on the last Sunday of each month. The members of this mission are pew-holders
							at St. Vincent's. The Rev. Francis A. King, residing in St. Joseph's Hospital, is the

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">PERU.</hi><lb/> ST. CHARLES BORROMEO'S CHURCH.<lb/>
							1838.</head>

						<p>The city of Peru was surveyed in the spring of 1834, and, in the summer of the same
							year, work was let on the construction of the canal bed, which brought persons seeking
							work or engaged in trade to this place. The records have preserved for us the names of
							some of the earliest missionaries, visiting Peru. The first of these is Rev. Stephen
							Badin, from 1834 to <pb id="VAB8203-214" n="214"/> 1837. During the summer of 1835
							visits were made by the Rev. John A. Corcoran, who died here, and was buried on the
							north banks of the Wabash river between the river and the canal; later his remains
							were removed to the Reyburn cemetery at the instance of William D. McGregor, the first
							white resident on the site of Peru; and later still, in 1887, fifty-two years after
							his death, was reinterred in St. Charles' cemetery, on the lot of Michael Cannon. The
							Rev. Matthew Ruff paid a visit in 1837. From 1837 to 1842 Rev. Michael J. Clark was
							the pastor of Peru, and quasi resident. Rev. Maurice de St. Palais, residing at
							Logansport, attended Peru from 1842 to 1845. Rev. Francis Fischer, in 1846, and Rev.
							Patrick McDermott from 1848 to 1852, both from Logansport. Rev. August M. Martin, Rev.
							William Doyle, from 1851 to 1852; Rev. Anthony Carius, from 1852 to 1857, who
							afterwards was a priest in the Leavenworth diocese and died chaplain in an Ursuline
							convent, St. Louis, Missouri; Rev. Charles T. Zucker from 1857 to 1860, later in the
							diocese of Albany, New York; Rev. George A. Hamilton, who came from Logansport
							September 1, 1859. He purchased several acres, for cemetery purposes. These latter
							priests were supposed to hold services about once a month.</p>

						<p>It is a matter of record that on June 19, 1838, for a consideration of $2.00, William
							N. Hood and Sophia C. Hood conveyed to "William Brute, Catholic Bishop, and to his
							successors in the holy office, lots 259 and 260, original plat." A frame church,
							20x40, was erected on lot 259 in 1838. The first resident pastor was Rev. Bernard
							Joseph Force, who was appointed as such on April 15, 1860. On November 26, 1860, he
							secured the adjoining lot 261 for $250. The last purchase of ground, lots 257 and 258
							for $4,400 on March 22, 1901, was made by Rev. H. Meissner.</p>

						<p>On January 5, 1864, Rev. Bernard Kroeger was made pastor in Peru. Having ,added a
							little sacristy to the frame church, he proceeded to the erection of a new church of
							brick of Gothic design, 133x60 feet. All but the steeple was completed for $21,000,
							and was dedicated by Bishop Luers on December 8, 1867. When Father Kroeger left on
							October 1, 1871, the church had hardly any debt. Father Meissner added the spire, 183
							feet to the church in 1888, which with roof <pb id="VAB8203-215" n="215"/>
							improvements cost $9,500. He had the church frescoed, and put in Munich stained, glass
							windows, costing together $6,000. A pipe organ for $3,000 was added in 1893; the Main
							Altar was remodeled and two new Side Altars erected, in 1884, the latter costing
							$1,050, stations of the Cross $150, pulpit $500.</p>

						<p>Rev. J. H. Guendling, who has been the pastor since July 4, 1902, had the church
							redecorated in 1905 and the church completely furnished, for a total of $4,900. The
							steam heating plant for church, school and house was put in, in 1902, for $6,000. The
							seating capacity of the church is 600.</p>

						<p>For a number of years school was taught in the church itself, but when the present
							church was occupied in 1867, the old church was used for school purposes, until it
							burned down in 1873, when Rev. Lawrence Lamoor proceeded at once to the erection of
							the present school building, three stories, 50x80 feet, with residence for Sisters
							annexed, costing $16,000.</p>

						<p>The records show that Rev. Michael J. Clark personally taught the school, from 1837
							to 1842. During the pastorate of Father Force, Gabriel Volkert taught the classes, and
							"led in prayer," during the absence of the pastor. At that time the school was on the
							corner of Fifth and Wabash streets, in the pastor's residence. Some time after, Father
							Force engaged Franz Edtler to assist his sister Mary Force, in the care of the
							schools; but Professor Edtler, shortly after, accepted the position of organist of the
							Fort Wayne Cathedral, which he held for twenty-five years. Victor Stephens came next,
							and was succeeded, in 1866, by Theodore Wolfram who resigned in 1867, followed by John
							Schenk, a brilliant young pedagogue, later a brother-in-law to Count John Creighton,
							of Omaha. Thomas Miller and Mary Kinney had charge of the school for two years from
							1866 to 1868. The last of the lay teachers was Professor Rudolph Ladislaus Mueller of
							Zamzow, a native of Pomerania, conversing fluently in fifteen different languages,
							lecturer on mathematics in a military academy in Prussia, came to the United States
							lectured east and west on ethnological subjects, lost his considerable wealth in
							mining, would not return home where he had been disinherited on account of his
							conversion to the Catholic Faith, taught in St. Vincent's College, West Moreland,
							Pennsylvania, for several terms, when Rev. B. Kroeger, a former pupil of his, offered
							him the position of <pb id="VAB8203-216" n="216"/> teacher of the parochial school at
							Peru. He filled this position satisfactorily for three and a half years, when Bishop
							Dwenger secured his services for the seminary of the Sanguinist Fathers at Carthagena,
							Ohio, where he became a member of that community and died in 1885. Rev. B. Kroeger in
							September, 1869, invited the Ursuline Sisters, four in number, to teach the girls in
							the parish school, the boys being taught by Francis G. Horn. Father Lamoor, who
							succeeded Father Kroeger, in October 1871, invited the Sisters of Providence from St.
							Mary-of-the-Woods to take charge of the school, which they did in 1874; and Frank Horn
							resigning in September, 1881, these Sisters assumed charge of the boys' school also.
							The usual grades are taught by nine Sisters, and the attendance is 261.</p>

						<p>The pastoral residence was erected by Father Force, in 1861, to which Rev. H.
							Meissner built an addition in 1890. The original cost was $1,700.</p>

						<p>The various organizations of the parish are: The Rosary Society, since 1858, for
							women only, with 100 members; the Catholic Knights of America, since 1878, with forty
							members; the Ancient Order of Hibernians, with forty-eight members, and the Auxiliary
							of the same, since 1897, with forty-five members; the St. Aloysius' Society, since
							1864, with forty-three members; the Poor Souls Confraternity, since 1880, with 200
							members; the Young Ladies' Sodality, with 113 members; the Third Order of St. Francis,
							with fifty members; the Knights of Columbus, since 1902, with 140 members. The total
							number of souls of the parish is 1,100, constituting 250 families. The debt on the
							church property at present is $4,000.</p>

						<p>The records of the parish note some special events: Rev. Anthony Carius was the
							celebrant of the first High Mass in Peru in 1853; Confirmation was administered for
							the first time in 1859; a week's Mission in February 1862, and the first in Peru,
							conducted by Rev. F. X. Weninger, S. J.; Father Meissner, having paid the church debt
							of $16,350 with $5,000 accumulated interest, made due publication of the fact and the
							event was commemorated in a Jubilee of thanksgiving, on January 1, 1887; Bishop
							Dwenger named Father Meissner irremovable rector, on January 14, 1887; the third
							centennial of St. Charles Borromeo, November 3, and 4, 1884; the Silver Sacerdotal
							Jubilee of Father Meissner, July 5, 1893.</p>

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">LAFAYETTE.</hi><lb/> ST. MARY'S CHURCH.<lb/>
							1844.</head>

						<p>The city of Lafayette was laid out in 1825, and in 1840 it had at least fifteen
							Catholic families. At their request, Bishop de la Hailandiere directed Rev. August
							Martin, residing at Logansport, to visit Lafayette occasionally, and after him visits
							were made also by Rev. C. Francois, as well as by Rev. Simon P. Lalumiere, of Terre
							Haute. In those days Mass was celebrated in the houses of the different families.</p>

						<p>In 1843, the Bishop of Vincennes gave Lafayette its first resident pastor, in the
							person of Rev. Michael J. Clark. The number of families had now increased to
							twenty-five, and Father Clark rented a one-story brick building, on Fourth street just
							south of the postoffice, in which the services were <pb id="VAB8203-218" n="218"/>
							regularly held. In 1844, a site was bought on the corner of Fifth and Brown streets,
							on which in the same year the St. Mary and Martha's Church was erected, at a cost of
							$10,000, and was at the time the most imposing and handsomest church edifice in all
							Northern Indiana; known later as St. Joseph's Hall, and still existing under the name
							of Columbian Hall. A priest's house was built, in the rear of the church, but was soon
							after destroyed by fire. The pastor, appreciating the importance of a parochial
							school, erected a school building on the ruins of the pastoral residence. Father Clark
							remained the energetic pastor at Lafayette for fourteen years until 1857, when he went
							to Illinois, and having charge of a congregation in Bloomington, died full of years
							and good works.</p>

						<p>Rev. Daniel Maloney. succeeded Father Clark, but remained only one year and a half,
							when he was given an appointment in Indianapolis. Rev. Edmund B. Kilroy came next in
							1859, and remained until 1861. In 1860, Lawrence B. Stockton donated a plot of ground,
							known as Seminary Hill, for a church, school, and parochial residence. The Sisters of
							Providence erected the present St. Ignatius' Academy on these grounds, at their own
							expense, for $20,000. Up to the arrival of the Sisters of Providence, the parochial
							school was taught by lay teachers, on Fifth street, with an attendance of about fifty
							pupils. Father Kilroy was appointed chaplain for the United States troops, during the
							Civil War, in 1861, and was succeeded, as pastor at Lafayette, by the Rev. George A.
							Hamilton, a cousin of Archbishop Spalding, and a Kentuckian by birth. The foundation
							of the new St. Mary's Church had been laid by Father Kilroy, and after five years of
							indefatigable labor, and at a cost of $60,000 over and above that which had been
							expended on the foundation, the church was completed and dedicated in 1866. The
							present pastoral residence was erected at an outlay of $8,000. The boys' school, on
							South street, was constructed and paid for by the Community of the Holy Cross, of
							Notre Dame. The Brothers of the Holy Cross were the teachers of the boys' school, from
							1867 until 1895.</p>

						<p>Father Hamilton also erected St. Ann's Chapel, on Wabash avenue; and bought twelve
							acres of land for the enlargement of St. Mary's cemetery. After a most successful
							pastorate of eleven years, Father Hamilton died suddenly on April 8, 1875, <pb
								id="VAB8203-219" n="219"/> with barely time for his assistant, Father Hallinan, to
							administer the sacrament of Extreme Unction. His remains rest beneath St. Mary's
							Church. The Rev. Matthew E. Campion was pastor of St. Mary's Church, for about four
							and a half years. During his time two elegant side altars were provided. He paid off a
							large sum of the indebtedness of the church, and gave much time and attention to
							beautifying St. Mary's cemetery. At his own request he was relieved of his charge
							here, and was appointed pastor at Laporte. The Rev. Martin Noll was appointed in 1880,
							and came here from Elkhart. He arranged at once for a mission in St. Mary's Church,
							but, the mission hardly over, he died of a stroke of apoplexy, within a month of his
							arrival, on June 4, 1880. Rev. Joseph Rademacher now was the pastor of St. Mary's
							Church, from June 1880 to June 24, 1883, when he was consecrated Bishop of Nashville.
							He was noted for zeal and prudence and loved by all, for his gentle and fatherly
							disposition. He was popularly known as Father Joseph.</p>

						<p>In June 1883, the Rev. Edward P. Walters succeeded Father Joseph. In 1887, St. Mary's
							Church was made an irremovable rectorate and deanery. During his time, Father Walters
							had the church beautifully frescoed, and artistic stained glass windows put in. He
							reduced the debt of $15,000 to $2,500. He died, after an illness of only a few weeks,
							on June 12, 1894. His remains rest in St. Mary's cemetery. On August 4, 1894, Rev.
							John R. Dinnen was appointed rector of St. Mary's Church. In the year following he
							purchased the boys' school building and grounds from the Community of the Holy Cross,
							at Notre Dame, and within two years paid off the old debt of St. Mary's. In the spring
							of 1898, a steeple was added to the church. The interior of the church was wholly
							renovated, a new floor was put in throughout, with new pews, stained glass windows in
							the front of the church; and, besides all this, a costly heating plant for heating the
							church, the academy, the boys' school and pastoral residence was installed. These
							improvements were made from June to October 1904, at a cost of about $14,000. The
							indebtedness on the church property, at the present time, is $6,150.</p>

						<p>St. Mary's Congregation numbers about 255 families or 965 souls. One hundred and
							seventy children attend the <pb id="VAB8203-220" n="220"/> schools, conducted by eight
							Sisters of Providence, including a high school course. The Confraternity of the Sacred
							Heart of Jesus, with 150 members; the Children of Mary with forty-five; the Young
							Ladies' Sodality of the Immaculate Conception, with fifty; the Rosary Society, with
							fifty-six; the Holy Name Society, with forty-five, and the Holy Angels' Society, with
							forty-eight, constitute the organizations of the parish.</p>

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">HUNTINGTON.</hi><lb/> SS. PETER AND PAUL'S CHURCH.<lb/>
							1845.</head>

						<p>Catholicity, in Huntington county, dates back to the year 1838, when about a half
							dozen families, chiefly Irish laborers, were employed in the construction of the
							canal. The Rev. Julian Benoit was the first offerer of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass,
							on August 15, 1843, in the residence of the Roche family. After Father Benoit, Rev. E.
							M. Faller and Rev. John Ryan attended Huntington, as a station, regularly every three
							months. During this time, Francis Lafontaine, chief of the Miami Indian tribe, and his
							father-in-law, Rushville, donated a piece of ground, on which a small log church was
							erected. The chief Lafontaine died April 13, 1847, and was buried near the log
							church.</p>

						<p>The first resident priest at Huntington was Rev. Dr. A. Schippert, native of the
							kingdom of Wuertemberg, and a convert from lutheranism. He lived in a rented cottage
							on Cherry <pb id="VAB8203-221" n="221"/> street. He procured and laid out a new
							cemetery at the edge of town. His pastorate continued from March 1857 till August
							1858, when on account of ill health he retired to Innsbruck, Tyrol.</p>

						<p>His immediate successor was Rev. Frederick Fuchs, a native of Munster, Westphalia. He
							came to Huntington from Cincinnati. He immediately built a frame addition to the log
							church, and opened a school. He also erected a priest's house of brick, remarking that
							at last the "fox had found shelter." The number of families at this time was one
							hundred German and thirty-nine Irish and French families. After five years of
							successful labor, considerations of health brought about his removal to Klaasville.
							Rev. Martin Kink was pastor, from August to December 1863. Bavaria was his native
							country, to which he returned and where he died. In December, 1863, Rev. Jacob Mayer
							was appointed pastor. It was he who built the present church, a Gothic structure of
							brick, 142x58 feet. The cost of the building amounted to about $30,000, of which he
							paid all but $9,564. After five years of indefatigable labors, he was transferred to
							Logansport, in August 1868. The next pastor was Rev. George Steiner, born in New Ulm,
							Bavaria, April 13, 1836. He gave the School Sisters of Notre Dame charge of the
							school; he completed the church spire and gave the steeple a clock; he furnished oil
							paintings of the fourteen stations of the cross, and in 1873, built a large and
							substantial school house of brick, together with a Sisters' residence at a cost of
							$17,000. He suffered with hemorrhage of the lungs and spent the winter of 1876 to 1877
							in Florida, and spring and summer of 1877 in Minnesota to recover his health. In the
							meantime, Rev, J. H. Hueser, D. D., had charge of the parish. In January, 1880, he
							resigned as pastor and with his faithful friend, Rev. Julius Becks, went to
							Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he died peacefully, on June 1st, of the same year.</p>

						<p>The pastorate of his successor, Rev. J. H. Hueser, D. D., extends from January 1880
							to August 24, 1906. During this time he paid off old debts in the sum of $14,238, and
							besides made repairs and improvements, aggregating $43,000. The improvements made were
							a new pastoral residence for $10,000, a main altar $2,300, a chime of three bells
							$1,350, frescoing of the church and renovating the same $6,000, an organ $4,000, <pb
								id="VAB8203-222" n="222"/> ten stained glass windows from the Tyrolese Art Glass
							Company $5,140, tuck pointing brick work of church, and veneering the foundation
							$1,300, furnaces for the three buildings $2,500, cemetery of twenty acres $4,200.</p>

						<p>The societies of SS. Peter and Paul's Parish are: St. Joseph's Society, since 1857,
							with a membership of seventy-one; the Archconfraternity of Christian Mothers, with 160
							members; St. Aloysius Society, for Young Men, with forty-two members; the Young
							Ladies' Sodality, with 100 members; the Holy Angels' Sodality with eighty-eight

							attending also to Andrews as a station, for three years; Rev. Bruno Soengen, during
							six months; Rev. Francis P. Faust, from December 1895 to October 1897; Rev. Ignatius
							F. Zircher, from June 1902 till April 1905; Rev. Joseph Jagemann succeeded Father

						<p>The town of Decatur was laid out in 1836, and had in it, at the time, five houses. In
							1838, about a dozen Catholic families had settled in and about Decatur, and, in the
							spring of that year, Rev. Louis Mueller, residing at Fort Wayne, <pb id="VAB8203-223"
								n="223"/> offered the first Mass on record at Decatur, in the house of George
							Fittich. The second priest, whose name appears on the records, is Rev. Joseph de
							Mutzig Hamion assisting at a marriage, on January 10, 1841. After him came Rev. Joseph
							Rudolph, who began to collect money for a church, and the heavy timbers were being
							hauled. The fourth visiting pastor was Rev. Alphonse Munschina, and the fifth Rev. E.
							M. Faller. The old cemetery in the south part of town was bought in 1842. The first
							church was built in 1846. Up to this time Mass had been said in Fittich's house, in
							the Closs Tavern and in the old Court House. About this time also, Rev. Julian Benoit
							came here to say Mass, to preach in English and French, and to attend the sick. The
							first church bell was bought by Father Faller at Cincinnati for $60, and it had to be
							shipped by canal to Fort Wayne, and to be hauled from there to Decatur. At this time
							the church grounds consisted of six lots.</p>

						<p>The sixth visiting priest, who was also the first resident pastor at Decatur, was the
							Rev. B. H. Schultes, who built the first priest's house in 1852; he remained till
							August 1856. From August 1856 till June 1857, Father Faller and Father Rudolph again
							paid visits to Decatur. Rev. Sebastian Ganther, C. PP. S. was here from June 1857 till
							May 1858. After him, in 1858, came Rev. L. Schneider, who remained only a few months.
							Rev. Jacob Mayer was pastor from July 1858 to September 1862. During his pastorate a
							mission was held, in 1857, by Rev. Andrew Kunkler, C. PP. S. and the second, ii 1859,
							by Rev. F. X. Weninger, S. J.</p>

						<p>Until 1865, the Rev. A. Heitmann visited Decatur from time to time. Rev. Julius Becks
							came in January 1865, and remained one year. The pastorate of Rev. John Wemhoff
							extends from 1866 to September 1872. He collected funds for the present church, and
							laid the foundation. From September 1872 until February 1877, Rev. Frederick Von
							Schwedler was the pastor. It was he who built the brick church. He was succeeded by
							Rev. Joseph Nussbaum, in February 1877, and remained until July 20, 1880, on which
							date the present pastor, Rev. Herman Theodore Wilken, took charge of St. Mary's Church
							at Decatur. In the year of his arrival Father Wilken began at once the erection of a
							new school-house, and finished the same in 1881.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-224" n="224"/>

						<p>In 1895, he built a new Sisters' house and added two school-rooms to the
							school-house. These latter buildings cost $7,500, and were paid out of the bequest of
							Henry Dirkes. The Sisters of St. Agnes have had charge of the parish school in Decatur
							since 1881. On July 22, 1906, the Sister Superioress celebrated the Silver Jubilee of
							her arrival and her labors, in St. Mary's school and parish.</p>

						<p>The parish has 240 families, numbering 1,200 souls. The church property consists of
							ample grounds, a fine brick church, a priest's residence with every modern
							improvements, and a commodious brick school-house, with six large school-rooms and a
							brick Sisters' residence with twelve rooms.</p>

						<p>Rev. John Blum was assistant priest from November 1896 to November 1, 1900. Rev.
							Lawrence A. Eberle was assistant priest, with Portland for a mission, from July 1904
							to July 3, 1905. Rev. John B. Steger, from August 24, 1905 to September 15, 1906. Rev.
							George Angermaier, since September 16, 1906.</p>

						<p>Across Lake county, situated in the northwest corner of the State of Indiana, the
							watershed, extending from east to west, separates the St. Lawrence basin from the
							Mississippi valley. This line enters the county from the west, in St. John township,
							passing north of the headwaters of West creek, which runs very close to St. John and
							here takes a southwesterly course. In the early days the locality was called Western
							Prairie, and also Prairie West, but when a postoffice was established the settlers, at
							a public meeting, gave it the name St. John. This was done partly because the name of
							the first German settler was John Hack, who immigrated, in September 1837, with a
							large family. John Hack's house was located about one mile southeast of the present
							church. St. John township, not only almost exclusively Catholic but also German, has
							in it three churches: One at St. John, the other at Dyer, and the third at
							Schererville. St. John the Evangelist's Church, in St. John, is the mother church of
							all the other churches in Lake county. Until 1856 it was known as "HI. Kreuz
							Auffindung Kirche," as we find it recorded in the old baptismal record, over the
							signature of F. Cointet, C. S. C., under date of January 4, 1847. On the same page of
							that record we find that the Rev. A. Carius blessed the cemetery, comprising about one
							and a quarter acres.</p>

						<p>Until 1839 Father Fischer, from Chicago, visited St. John, as a station, twice a
							month celebrating Mass in John Hack's house. The same Father also visited Baileytown,
							an Indian <pb id="VAB8203-226" n="226"/> settlement. In that same year, the
							congregation, numbering about ten families, built a little frame church, 18x24 feet,
							on John Hack's land, about a half mile southeast of the present church. Bishop de St.
							Palais furnished all the money for material and labor on this church. The lumber and
							other building material was transported from Chicago with ox teams, each trip
							requiring about one week's time. In 1842, in consequence of some trouble, a schism
							divided the parish, some members siding with John Hack, but the majority with the
							priest. The Hack faction retained the church, but Father Carius held divine service
							for the loyal party, in the house of John Thiel. In 1844 or 1845, the eighteen loyal
							families built a log church, the logs, the lumber and the labor for which were donated
							and $269.14 expended in cash. Bishop de St. Palais administered Confirmation in this
							church in 1846, the first confirmation in Lake county.</p>

						<p>It was under the pastorate of Father Force, that the present brick church was
							erected. It measured 90x52 feet, with a height of 25 feet; it cost from $7,000 to
							$8,000. With the exception of putting new shingles on roof, no improvements whatever
							have been made since. At the time of the building of the church, the congregation
							numbered about 120 families. The dedication took place, on October 20, 1856, as we see
							it recorded in the church books over the signature of E. Sorin, who signs himself V.
							G. The record says that Father Force was the pastor, that Rev. F. Mayer, C. S. C.,
							celebrated the Mass, that the same preached in German and that Father Sorin preached
							in English, on the occasion.</p>

						<p>The first parochial school was opened in St. John, in 1846, by the Brothers and
							Sisters of the Holy Cross, from Notre Dame. Father Tusch, on August 2, 1857, makes
							this record on the books in regard to the school: "109 Kinder in der Schule, and der
							Schwester Conceptschen bezahlt $15.00." With the beginning of the Civil War the
							parochial school was closed, and was continued thereafter as a public or district
							school. Having rented the public school building for $150 per year, the congregation
							again has a parochial school, since September 4, 1903. Two Sisters of St. Francis,
							from Lafayette, teach the school, which has an attendance of seventy-nine
							children.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-227" n="227"/>

						<p>The church property consists of three pieces of land, in all ten acres; four acres,
							where the present church stands, on which also is situated the old priest's house a
							two-story building erected in 1859, in which Father Heitmann continues to live, and
							also the cemetery; across the road, opposite the church, two acres on which stands now
							the first little church, remodeled for a Sisters' residence; the third piece of land,
							four acres, is located, about a half mile southeast of the present church, on which
							stood the first church and where also was the first little cemetery. The present
							pastor is living in a rented house, at a distance of about one block from the church.
							St. John's parish has a Rosary Society, for married women, with twenty members; a
							Sodality for single women, sixty-five members; a Sodality for single men, thirty
							members; the Central Verein, eighty-one members; Catholic Foresters, sixty-two
							members, and the Columbian League, with thirty-six members.</p>

						<p>The congregation consists of eighty-nine families, numbering 406 souls. Father
							Buchheit is about to make repairs and improvements, which have become necessary, on
							the church, to cost about $500. He also had an architect to prepare the plans and
							specifications for a new pastoral residence; which will contain about twelve rooms, is
							to be constructed a frame building, will cost about $4,500.</p>

							1848.</head>

						<p>In 1848, thirty German families, who were members of St. Augustine's Church, bought
							some lots on the corner of Lafayette and Jefferson streets for $1,700. This was the
							inauguration of St. Mary's Church, for the German Catholics. An evidence of the fact
							that these people were in earnest, is seen when five men mortgaged their farms to pay
							for the lots. The first building erected measured 32x64 feet, and was completed on the
							29th of November, 1848. This building afterwards served as a girls' school. The Rev.
							Edward M. Faller was the pastor of the new parish. At the same time a small one story
								<pb id="VAB8203-228" n="228"/> frame house was built to serve as a pastoral
							residence. A frame school house, that served the Germans, when still members of St.
							Augustine's parish, was moved in 1849 from Calhoun street to the rear of the pastoral
							residence.</p>

						<p>Bishop de St. Palais, of Vincennes, visited the new parish in 1850 to administer
							Confirmation and gave the church $500. The first edifice served for church purposes
							until 1858, when the erection of a more commodious building was begun. In 1857, the
							Rev. Joseph Weutz was made the successor of Father Faller, who had been transferred to
							New Albany. The cornerstone for the new St. Mary's Church was laid by Bishop Luers, in
							the summer of 1858, and on the second of November, 1859, the church, 133x66 feet, was
							dedicated by him. The erection of the church entailed an expense of $30,000. During
							the absence of Father Weutz in Europe, in 1871, Rev. F. Von Schwedler had charge and
							completed the spire. Father Weutz's assistant priests were, in turn, Revs. A.
							Heitmann, A. Young and B. T. Borg.</p>

						<p>Rev. J. Weutz resigned the pastorate of St. Mary's in 1872, and Bishop Dwenger
							appointed the Rev. Joseph Rademacher, with Rev. Charles Steurer as his assistant.
							Seven years later, Father Rademacher was transferred to Lafayette. Rev. J. H.
							Oechtering was appointed pastor of St. Mary's on July 14, 1880. He had for assistants,
							successively, the Revs. C. Steurer, C. Ganzer, L. A. Moench, C. M. Romer, R. Denk and
							G. Hottenroth.</p>

						<p>Half past one o'clock in the afternoon of January 13, 1886, will ever remain
							memorable in the history of St. Mary's. At that hour the boiler, beneath the church,
							from some cause not known, exploded. The church now presented a disastrous scene of
							wreck and ruin. The shock of that explosion was felt over the city. The fireman was
							killed and a little girl, passing the church at the time, was struck and instantly
							killed by a door blown from its hinges. But the energetic pastor and his generous
							people were not discouraged. An architect of Cleveland, at once received orders to
							draw the plans of a new and better building. On the 11th of July, 1886, the
							cornerstone of the new church was laid by Bishop Dwenger. The present St. Mary's
							Church, including decorations and furniture, cost $100,000. It was dedicated on the
							third Sunday of Advent, <pb id="VAB8203-229" n="229"/> 1887, by Bishop Dwenger, amidst
							the rejoicings of a vast concourse of people. Bishop Rademacher, of Nashville, and
							Very Rev. Abbelen, of Milwaukee, took part in the solemnities. The seating capacity of
							the church, exclusive of galleries, is 950. Its style of architecture is Gothic, the
							length being 195 feet, the width 68 feet, and the height of the middle nave at the
							intersection of the arches is 66 feet. The transept has a length of 84 feet and a
							width of 34 feet. Each nave ends in a sanctuary of octagonal form. The front of the
							building is flanked on each side by towers about 120 feet in height. The main steeple
							in the middle, including the cross has a height of 237 feet. The Crucifixion Group
							over the main altar is a work of art. St. Mary's Academy, a handsome building, took
							the place of the old school house in the year 1892, at a cost of $20,000.</p>

						<p>In the year 1903 a large building was erected for a boys school, on the two lots
							opposite the church. On the ground floor are six school rooms. The second story
							contains a magnificent hall, dining-room, etc. In the basement are meeting and
							recreation rooms for the young men, a gymnasium, bowling alleys, billiards, library
							and reading rooms and baths. The cost was $30,000. In the same year a steam heating
							plant was provided.</p>

						<p>The priest's house, a frame structure, was bought with the lot on which it stands, in
							1886, for $5,000. An addition cost $1,800. The first house was a little frame building
							erected in 1846; the second, was of brick costing $5,000, but it was destroyed by the
							explosion in 1886.</p>

						<p>A house for the organist, a two-story brick building, situated west of the boys'
							school, cost about $3,000. A boiler house south of the church built of stone and
							brick, 30x20 feet, cost about $1,200.</p>

						<p>Ten boys of the parish have become priests and forty-five girls have become
							Sisters.</p>

						<p>Priests who served St. Mary's Congregation: Rev. Edward M. Faller was pastor from
							1848 till 1849; Rev. Joseph Weutz, from 1857 till 1872; Rev. Joseph Rademacher, from
							1872 till 1880; Rt. Rev. Mgr. John H. Oechtering, V. G., has been pastor since
							1880.</p>

						<p>St. Mary's Church has the following societies: St. Charles <pb id="VAB8203-230"
								n="230"/> Borromeo Mutual Benefit Society, with 166 members, was organized in 1859,
							for men; Catholic Knights of America, with forty-one members, and Benevolent Legion,
							with eighty-seven members, are insurance societies; St. Aloysius' Society for young
							men, with. 189 members, has existed since 1868; St. Stanislaus' Society, for boys up
							to their sixteenth year, with sixty-three members; St. Rose's Young Ladies' Society,
							established in 1868, is an altar society with 179 members; the Children of Mary, for
							girls up to their sixteenth year with seventy-five members; the Holy Rosary Society

							the one for men, the other for women, organized for the support of the schools.</p>

						<p>The parish has 488 families, and the total number of souls is 2,196. The two school

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">MISHAWAKA.</hi><lb/> ST. JOSEPH'S CHURCH.<lb/>
							1848.</head>

						<p>The history of this parish dates back to the year 1833, when the celebrated Father
							Badin visited these parts. However, in 1844, Very Rev. Edward Sorin, C. S. C.,
							established a regular order of services for Mishawaka, and for a few years Mass was
							celebrated in the homes of Edward Mulligan, George Smith and Jeremiah Luce. From 1848
							until 1855, a room in the residence on the southeast corner of Lawrence and Margaret
							streets was arranged for divine service, and to it the name was given, "Holy Angels
							Church." In the latter year, 1855, a small frame building, for church purposes, was
							erected on the north-west corner of Grove and Sarah streets, but this building was
							destroyed by fire in 1860. The priests who attended Mishawaka, prior to 1857, were all
							members of the Congregation of the Holy Cross. Their names were: Very Rev. Edward
							Sorin, Revs. F. Cointet, J. Gouesse, R. A. Shortis, <pb id="VAB8203-231" n="231"/> W.
							Masterson, C. Schilling, A. Fourmount, M. P. Rooney, B. J. Force, Alexius Granger, E.
							B. Kilroy, Thomas Flynn and M. Prendergast.</p>

						<p>The Rev. B. Mager was the first resident pastor at Mishawaka, from 1857 for a period
							of eighteen months. In 1859, Rev. Henry Koenig was appointed, who began at once to
							collect funds for a .new church. The Civil War brought on hard times, and Father
							Koenig made collecting trips into Ohio, not without success. At this time, Mishawaka
							had about thirty-four Catholic families. The new church was a brick building with
							stone trimmings, with a seating capacity of about 300, and was erected by Father
							Koenig, on the corner of Third and Spring streets, where the school-house now stands,
							at a cost of about $8,000. Bishop Luers laid the corner stone in June, and dedicated
							the church on December 8, 1861. The name of the church was now changed from Holy
							Angels' Church to St. Joseph's Church. This church served the congregation, as a place
							of worship, until October 22, 1893. In the old church 1826 baptisms were administered,
							284 couples were married, and from it 580 were buried.</p>

						<p>The Rev. August Bernard Oechtering took charge of St. Joseph's Church, Mishawaka, on
							May 17, 1867. He found it indebted for $3,000, and the furnishings of the church poor.
							He paid off most of this debt during two years, and 1869 purchased the property on the
							corner of Fourth and Mill streets, for $3,200.</p>

						<p>As far back as 1854, a French lady taught the few Catholic children in a building, at
							the southeast corner of Main and First streets. Later, the Sisters of the Holy Cross
							located in Mishawaka, and would have established St. Mary's Academy in what is now
							Battell Park, but fanaticism and bigotry of a violent type drove them away. After
							this, until 1864, school was taught, by different gentlemen, in the vestry room of St.
							Joseph's Church. In that year, a brick school building was erected, on Spring street,
							in the rear of the church. A frame school-house was built on Fourth street, in 1870,
							and in 1876 an addition was made to the brick school-house, and still later another
							school was built on Mill street.</p>

						<p>Prior to 1885, additional improvements were made in the frescoing of the church, in
							the purchase of a pulpit and of three <pb id="VAB8203-232" n="232"/> large bells.
							Ground for the Catholic Cemetery had been bought in 1865, and here too, many
							improvements were made. A residence for the Sisters, known as St. Agnes Convent, as
							well as the pastor's residence, the latter on the corner of Fourth and Spring streets,
							were provided. Up to this time the pastor resided in the frame dwelling, now occupied
							by the janitor.</p>

						<p>The Silver Jubilee of Father Oechtering, in 1886, was celebrated with particular
							solemnity. Bishop Dwenger of Fort Wayne, Bishop Rademacher of Nashville, many priests
							and distinguished laymen took part. Many other memories cling to the old St. Joseph's
							Church. From this church went forth seven young men as priests, two young men for the
							religious state of life, four ecclesiastical students and seventeen young ladies, as
							Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ. The present Chancellor of the diocese of Fort Wayne,
							the Rev. Simon M. Yenn, was one of the boys of old St. Joseph's.</p>

						<p>The first steps, toward the erection of the new church, were taken in November 1885,
							when a building fund was started, and in five years $22,000 had accumulated. The new
							church was to be Gothic in style, of white brick with limestone trimmings; and the
							dimensions were to be 151x602 feet; height of ceiling 50 feet and elevation of the
							spire 163 feet. On April 20, 1891, Father Oechtering "turned the first shovel full of
							earth, and the building committee following in the order of the seniority," and on
							August 30th, in the presence of 10,000 people, the corner stone was laid, Bishop
							Rademacher, of Nashville, officiating, and Rev. Thomas E. Walsh, President of Notre
							Dame University, preaching the English and Rev. D. Wermers of Detroit, the German
							sermon. The new church was dedicated, with becoming solemnity, on October 22, 1893, by
							Bishop Rademacher, now Bishop of Fort Wayne. Very Rev. A. Morrissey, of Notre Dame,
							and Rev. J. H. Oechtering of Fort Wayne, preached the English and the German sermons.
							The cost of the church and furnishings amounted to $65.000. It may be remarked, that
							the artistic communion railing, the pulpit and the altars were built by Mr. Erb and
							his sons, and that the pipe organ was built by Mr. Louis H. Vandinter; these gentlemen
							being members of the congregation.</p>

						<p>The school accommodations proved to be entirely unsatisfactory by this time. A new
							school building was determined <pb id="VAB8203-233" n="233"/> on, which was to be a
							two-story and basement building of brick and stone, with self supporting steel truss,
							slate roof. The dimensions were to be 136x70 feet with a transept of 80 feet. It was
							to have eight class-rooms, a chapel to seat 300 people, and a hall accommodating 700.
							The basement to be a gymnasium and recreation room. The cost of this building was
							estimated at $40,000. Rev. John H. Guendling officiated at the laying of the corner
							stone, and Rev. John Cavanaugh, C. S. C., delivered the sermon on education, June 22,
							1902. On Sunday, May 3, 1903, the building was dedicated by Bishop Alerding, who in
							the forenoon also administered confirmation to a class of 75.</p>

						<p>The energetic, untiring pastor, Father Oechtering, departed this life on December 28,
							1902, and was succeeded by Rev. Louis Aloysius Moench, on February 1, 1903, as Vicar
							pro tem. and on June 29, of the same year, was named irremovable rector. He found a
							debt of $37,000 on the church property, and he found also that the $40,000 school
							building, though under roof, was not completed and not furnished. The church grounds
							had to be graded, and cement sidewalks had to be constructed around the entire square.
							After four years of his pastorate, we find that he has made all the improvements
							necessary and that the indebtedness of the church property has been reduced to
							$17,450. There are 378 families and the number of souls is 1700.</p>

						<p>Seven Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ teach the school attended by 350 pupils. The
							Sisters reside in the St. Agnes' Convent, on Fourth street, opposite the church
							square. This property was a donation by Mrs. Phillips.</p>

						<p>St. Joseph's Church has the Holy Rosary Society for married women, with 220 members;
							the Young Ladies' Sodality, with 125 members; the Sacred Heart Sodality, for girls
							under 16, with 54 members; St. Leo's Society for Boys, with 50 members; St. Aloysius'
							Society, for Young Men, with 35 members; St. Joseph's Society, for Men, with 175
							members; the Catholic Knights of America, with 45 members; the Catholic Order of
							Foresters, with 60 members; the Women's Catholic Order of Foresters, with 35 members,

							CHURCH.<lb/> 1849.</head>

						<p>In all probability, the ancient and mysterious establishment known as A-ber-Cronk at
							the mouth of Trail Creek was a trading post for exchange for the Indians. It is here
							where Michigan City is located, and was early known as Baileytown, so called after
							Joseph Bailey, a trader and agent for the American Fur Company, about the year 1832.
							The directory for 1844 mentions Rev. M. de St. Palais in connection with Michigan
							City. The church records of St. Mary's Church name the following early missionaries:
							Rev. R. A. Shortis, C. S. C., 1847-1852; Rev. C. Schilling, C. S. C., 1852-1853; Rev.
							A. Granger, C. S. C.; Rev. F. Cointet, C. S. C.; Rev. M. P. Rooney, C. S. C.; Rev. R.
							Wallace, C. S. C,; Rev. B. J. Force, C. S. C., from January 1853 to October 1854; and
							Father Schilling again, from October 1854 to March 1855. Rev. Thomas Flynn, C. S. 'C.,
							paid visits from March 1855 to December 7, 1856; Rev. E. B. Kilroy and Rev. B. Mager
							to October 25, 1857; on this date the Rev. Paul Gillen, C. S. C., was appointed the
							first resident pastor of Michigan City.</p>

						<p>The first church was remodeled from a small warehouse to the size of about 20x30
							feet, in 1849; it was situated on the corner of Washington and Second streets. This
							structure was replaced by a new frame church in 1854, and it is supposed was erected
							while Father Gillen was paying occasional pastoral visits here; the church was called
							St. Ambrose's Church. The Catholics of these early days were Irish, employed on the
							construction of the Michigan Central railroad. Gradually, however, German Catholics
							also settled in and about Michigan City. Rev. Martin Sherer, who resided at Laporte
							from 1854 to 1858, frequently visited Michigan City, and at his invitation <pb
								id="VAB8203-235" n="235"/> the Rev. F. X. Weninger, S. J., gave a mission for the
							Germans. He induced the Germans to build a church of their own, in 1859, on the corner
							of Washington and Fourth streets.</p>

						<p>In 1856 a parochial school was established alongside of St. Ambrose's Church, and a
							small frame dwelling for the Sisters of the Holy Cross. The priest's house, a small
							dwelling of three or four rooms, stood east of the church. The Catholic population
							being too small to maintain two separate parishes, the Rev. E. B. Kilroy was made
							pastor of both, while Father Sherer attended the Germans, from Laporte. Both Father
							Kilroy and Father Sherer were succeeded by Rev. George Steiner, as pastor of both
							churches from October 25, 1860 till September 21, 1864. Exclusive of labor and
							material donated, the cost of St. Ambrose's Church, school, Sisters' house and
							pastoral residence, did not exceed $1,500. The other, St. Mary's Church, costing
							$1,521.34 had a debt of $940.04, when Father Steiner took charge. The so-called
							trustees created many difficulties for the pastor, in their anxiety to manage the
							finances of the parish. However there was not much to manage, when we see from the
							church books that the total receipts for the year 1861, amounted to $264.62; for 1862,
							$325.78; and for three months of 1863, $46.20. On August 1, 1863, Bishop Luers
							attended a meeting of the parish, at which certain rules for the government of both
							parishes were adopted.<ref id="ref_002" rend="super" target="note_002">*</ref></p>

						<p>Rev. Julius Becks succeeded Father Steiner, and was pastor of both St. Ambrose and
							St. Mary's Churches, celebrating Mass in both churches, on every Sunday. This order of
							things continued until November 1, 1867, when both congregations were united, and
							began the construction of the present church, on Tenth and Buffalo streets. The number
							of souls, at this time, was from 120 to 150 families. The present St. Mary's Church,
							the school, the Sisters' Convent and the parochial residence stand on the ground
							purchased in 1852, for a cemetery. In this cemetery were buried the Catholics of
							Monon, Rensselaer, Lacrosse, Valparaiso, and Chesterton. Encroaching on the city
							limits this cemetery was condemned, and Father Becks purchased ten acres of ground to
							the south <milestone unit="typography" n="---" rend="center"/>
							<note id="note_002"><ref target="ref_002" rend="super">*</ref>One of the rules adopted
								was: <q>"Dass die Gemeinde ihren Seelsorger die Befoerderung ihrer geistlichen
									sowohl als auch materiellen Vortheile gaenzlich ueber lasse und in ihm den
									Vorstand. Secretaer, Schatzmeister, kurz den
									Gemeinde-oder-Kirchen-Vor-Neben-Hinter-und-Beisteher erkenne."</q> The minutes of
								the meeting were signed, Rev. G. Steiner.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8203-236" n="236"/> of the present city cemetery. The remains of all the
							buried were removed to the new cemetery, which was consecrated by Bishop Luers, in
							1865. Of the four acres of the old cemetery one full block and a three-quarter block
							were retained for church purposes.</p>

						<p>St. Mary's Church was built in 1868, and dedicated by Bishop Luers in 1869. The cost
							of the church and of the frame priest's house was $23,450. The church is Gothic,
							having simple but neat decorations; the debt in 1885 was $5,965. Father Becks built
							the present church and the old priest's house.</p>

						<p>The present pastor, Rev. John Bleckmann, was appointed to succeed Father Becks, on
							February 18, 1885. He has made many purchases and improvements, such as a new pipe
							organ for $1,500, new side altars for $800, frescoing of the church for $1,460, new
							pews for $1,365, gas and electric lighting with fixtures for $1,935, steam heating
							plant for $1,532, chime of church bells for $1,230. The seating capacity of the church
							is 600.</p>

						<p>Father Bleckmann erected the school buildings in 1886; the dimensions are 90x70 feet,
							with the Sisters' residence of fifteen rooms to the rear of the school building, at a
							cost of $23,372. The sum of $2,675 has been spent since, on the school, for various
							improvements. The Sisters of the Holy Cross taught the school up to 1897, when the
							Sisters of Notre Dame took charge. The eight grades and three years of high school are
							being taught by ten Sisters, with an attendance of 366 pupils. In 1905, Father
							Bleckmann erected a new pastoral residence with all modern conveniences, at a cost of
							about $17,000, to replace the old frame building, which had become entirely unfit for
							use. Other improvements, such as grading of the grounds and cement walks around
							church, school, and priest's house, were made in the same year. The debt on the church

							1850.</head>

						<p>The first immigrants in this part of the country were the Nix family, in 1847. Mass
							was celebrated, as early as 1848, in the house of Jacob Nix until, in 1850, a small
							frame church was erected, about three quarters of a mile southwest of the present
							church. The priests, who officiated in the house of Mr. Nix and in the first church,
							were Rev. E. M. Faller, Rev. A. Schippert, Rev. Frederick Fuchs, Rev. Jacob Mayer and
							Rev. Henry V. Schaefer, who came either from Fort Wayne, or Huntington. The church
							burned down, in 1868, and then divine services were held in the school house, near the
							site of the old church. Two acres of land were donated for church <pb id="VAB8203-238"
								n="238"/> and cemetery, by George Bemer. Rev. Theodore Vander-Poel, residing at
							Arcola, had charge of Nix Settlement and Roanoke, at that time. On July 19, 1869, the
							corner stone of the new brick church, 56x34 feet, was laid by Father Schaefer; Rev.
							George Steiner preached the sermon. Rev. William Woeste, and after him Rev. Cosmas
							Seeberger, C. PP. S., were resident pastors, at Roanoke, in rented houses, visiting
							Nix Settlement, the former twice a month, the latter every Sunday. Rev. W. Conrad
							Miller was the first resident pastor, at Nix Settlement, from October 1881 till 1883.
							In 1882, he erected the present priest's house, at the side of St. Catharine's Church.
							Prior to 1882, Father Miller resided at Roanoke, after that time at Nix Settlement.
							His successors were: Rev. F. J. Lambert, 1883 till 1884; Rev. Philip Guethoff, from
							1884 to 1889; Rev. Edward J. Boccard, from 1889 till 1895; Rev. Bruno Soengen, from
							December 1895 till June 23, 1905; Rev. John Biedermann, since June 30, 1905.</p>

						<p>The first brick church was defective in its construction, and was condemned, upon
							expert examination, by Bishop Rademacher. The building was accordingly torn down, and
							in its stead and on the same site, a larger and better church was erected. The
							dimensions of this new and present church are 36x84 feet; it is built of brick and has
							Bedford stone trimmings, the style of architecture is Gothic. The interior is finished
							in quarter-sawed, red oak, and is furnished with three Gothic altars, white and richly
							gilt, confessionals of oak, the pews of the same material, all oil finished. The
							seating capacity is 300. The windows are stained glass, and the frescoing is artistic.
							Bishop Rademacher being sick at the time, the corner stone was laid by the Vicar
							General, Very Rev. J. H. Guendling, on Trinity Sunday, 1899, and was dedicated on
							October 8, of the same year, in the presence of fully 3,000 people, by Rev. J. H.
							Oechtering, of Fort Wayne. The church was built during the pastorate of Father
							Soengen, and the cost of it was $10,000 with a debt of $1,700.</p>

						<p>Fathers Guethoff and Boccard contributed their share, during their pastorates,
							towards the improvement of the church property. The present pastor, Father Biedermann,
							installed in November 1905, a most satisfactory method for heating the church. The
							population of the parish at the present time is <pb id="VAB8203-239" n="239"/>
							thirty-four families, and a total of 166 souls. Other improvements, made by Father
							Biedermann, of a porch to the pastoral residence and of cement walks for the house and
							church were found necessary.</p>

						<p>St. Catharine's Church has St. Joseph's Sodality for married men, and St. Ann's
							Sodality, for married women, both since 1883; St. Mary's Sodality for single women,
							and St. Aloysius' Sodality, for single men. One child of the parish was ordained
							priest, in 1902. The total membership of the societies is eighty-three.</p>

							1851.</head>

						<p>French immigrants made up the settlement in Jackson township of Allen county, now
							called Besancon, about 1840. At that time it was known as New France. The thrifty
							settlers made, of the swamp land, the best farm land in Allen county.</p>

						<p>It was Rev. A. Bessonies, who first attended to their spiritual wants. He said Mass
							in the log house of Joseph Dodone. When, on January 14, 1851, Gideon Dickerson donated
							four acres of land to Bishop de St. Palais, a neat church was at once erected by
							Father Bessonies and placed under the patronage of St. Louis. Father Bessonies' labors
							here ceased, when the diocese of Fort Wayne was established, at the close of 1857.
							After him, Rev. Julian Benoit attended New France regularly, until 1864. He was held
							in great esteem and reverence by the people of New France. His picture is seen upon
							the walls of nearly every home; and, when the ceiling of the present church was first
							decorated, the parishoners insisted that the artist paint Father Benoit's portrait
							among the figures of the angels, on the sanctuary ceiling. Rev. Grevin was the first
							resident pastor. He built the first priest's house, a modest cottage, costing only a
							few hundred dollars. The four immediate successors of Father Grevin remained less than
							two years. They were: Rev. J. C. Carrier, C. S. C. from April to November 1866; Rev.
							F. M. Ruiz from November 1866 to April 1867; Rev. A. de Montaubricq from April to <pb
								id="VAB8203-240" n="240"/> December 1867 and Rev. Vandevennet from December 1867 to
							October 1868. Rev. A. Mignault then had charge of the parish until January 1, 1870,
							when the Rev. A. Adam, whom the well known Father Sorin of Notre Dame brought with him
							from France, became the resident pastor of St. Louis' Church.</p>

						<p>About this time, New France received its present name Besancon, owing to the fact
							that a large portion of the first settlers emigrated from the vicinity of the city of
							that name, in France. Father Adam, perceiving that the little frame church was
							becoming much too small for his growing congregation (then numbering 600 souls), and
							realizing that the people were now able to erect a more stately and substantial
							edifice, began to collect funds towards building a new church. Father Mignault had
							laid the foundation. When completed the church cost $10,000. The parishoners furnished
							timber for the most of the lumber, and the bricks were burnt a few rods from where the
							church stands. Father Adam contrived a unique way of raising funds for the new church.
							He asked the head of each family to raise a calf until it would be three years old;
							and his request was complied with. Each donated calf was marked by the pastor, as soon
							as it came into the world. Then on a given date a public sale was advertised, to which
							prospective buyers came from far and wide. The sale of these cattle netted over
							$3,000. In 1875 Father Adam received permission from Bishop Dwenger to return to
							France.</p>

						<p>The Rev. W. Demers, C. S. C., was appointed to succeed Father Adam, in 1875. A year
							later Rev. Constantine Maujay was made pastor, and served for two years. In 1880 Rev.
							Felix Veniard, C. S. C. took charge and liquidated the indebtedness of $3,000 on the
							church. Of this amount Father Benoit contributed $500. Father Veniard was longest the
							resident pastor of St. Louis' Church, having served from 1880 till his death in 1893.
							For the space of one year Besancon was attended every Sunday from the Cathedral, at
							Fort Wayne, by Rev. Charles Guendling and Rev. William J. Quinlan, of whom the latter
							built the present priest's house. Father Quinlan collected over $4,000 before the
							house was completed.</p>

						<p>In June, 1894, Rev. F. X. Labonte was appointed to the pastorate of Besancon, where
							he remained until February 1902, nearly eight years. During his pastorate he made <pb
								id="VAB8203-241" n="241"/> extensive improvements. Besides making repairs on the
							church and installing a new heating apparatus, he purchased six additional acres of
							land, on which stood a house, on September 1, 1897, at a cost of $1,050. On this
							ground he built a school and Sisters' residence, in 1898, at a cost of about $4,000.
							St Joseph's School, this was its name, was opened in the fall of 1900, with the
							Sisters of St. Agnes in charge. From February to June 1902, the Rev. F. J. Dandurand
							attended Besancon from Monroeville.</p>

						<p>The Rev. John F. Noll was transferred from Kendallville to Besancon, in June 1902.
							There was $6,000 of debt on the place when he took charge, which he reduced to $2,500,
							besides paying for improvements costing $3,000. The Church was beautifully frescoed in
							1904, the school house renovated and church property generally improved. Three new
							altars, which, with their furnishings, cost $1,300, were placed in the church and
							solemnly dedicated on May 30, 1906. On July 11, 1906, Father Noll was transferred to
							Hartford City and the Rev. Charles Dhe was appointed pastor of St. Louis' Church, at
							Besancon, where he remains at the present time. St. Louis' Congregation now has 108
							families numbering 544 souls.</p>

						<p>St. Louis' Church has the Confraternity of Christian Mothers organized on March 19,
							1906, with forty members, and the Children of Mary Sodality, with twelve members. Two
							boys of the parish are now preparing for the priesthood. The school is attended by
							forty-eight pupils, taught by two Sisters of St. Agnes. The debt on the church
							property, at the present time, is $2,300.</p>

						<p>In the archives of St. Joseph's Church is found an old book, dated September 29,
							1841, in which the Catholics of that time pledged themselves to pay a certain amount
							for the support of their priest, Rev. Joseph de Mutzig Hamion. Similar lists are found
							in that book up to 1846. The first priest visiting the Catholics here was, likely,
							Father Hamion. The first settlers were immigrants from Hesse Cassel, diocese of
							Fulda.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-242" n="242"/>

						<p>The church grounds consist of four acres, secured at four different times. These
							grounds also answer for cemetery purposes. The first church, a log building, was
							erected in 1851 or 1852, and later on a frame addition was made. The present church
							begun in 1860, was finished in 1861, by Rev. Jacob Mayer. Its dimensions are 80x42
							feet, and will seat 250 persons. It is a plain structure, without any pronounced style
							of architecture, though the altars, placed in 1892, are Gothic.</p>

						<p>The present school was built by Rev. J. H. Hueser, D.D., in 1879, a two-story brick
							building, 32x20 feet, with accommodations for 100 pupils. The cost of this building,
							including. a dwelling for the sisters, was about $3,690. Until 1870, the school was in
							charge of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ; since that time two Franciscan Sisters,
							of Joliet, Illinois, have taught the school, attended by sixty-six pupils. The school
							is a free school, all the expenses being paid by the St. Joseph's School Society.</p>

						<p>The priest's house is a brick building. It was begun at an earlier day, but Rev.
							Joseph Nussbaum, the first resident pastor at Hesse Cassel, completed it, in 1875. It
							was Father Nussbaum also who began to keep the parish records, as they should be kept.
							Four girls of Hesse Cassel have become Sisters.</p>

						<p>The following are the priests who have served the Catholics, at Hesse Cassel. The

						<p>The Catholic settlers at Lottaville, numbering about thirteen families, had emigrated
							from Bavaria, from 1840 to 1842. It seems that Rev. Francis Fischer, who at the time
							resided in Chicago, celebrated Mass for the first time in Lottaville (Turkey Creek) in
							a log house, in the year 1841, and paid bimonthly visits until 1846. Rev. A. Carius
							residing at St. John, Lake county, paid Lottaville regular monthly visits up to the
							year 1851, when a frame church was erected on the grounds of the present cemetery. At
							this time the number of families had increased to forty. It appears from the records
							that Revs. C. Schilling, C. S. C., Fuerst, James Joseph Mayer, Dresch, Wolfgang N.
							Giedl, paid Lottaville occasional visits.</p>

						<p>Rev. Philip Wegemeyer was the first resident pastor, and was succeeded by Rev. M. P.
							Wehrle, who built the stone church in 1863. Lottaville did not have a resident pastor
							continuously. Rev. Matthew Jacob Schmitz, of Dyer, attended it and built the present
							priest's house. The Rev. Henry Meissner was pastor at Lottaville from July 1871 to
							1873, and was succeeded by Revs. F. J. Freund, in 1874, F. X. Baumgartner, from 1874
							to December 1880, H. M. Roth, until the spring of 1883, Maurice Kaeder, O. S. B., and
							Æmilian Wenddell, O. S. B., in 1884. After these came the Rev. Joseph Flach from 1885
							till July 29, 1888, and after him Rev. Charles V. Stetter, D.D., who erected the
							present Sisters' dwelling. For two years, until November 1905, Lottaville was a
							mission attended from Hobart by Rev. Thomas F. Jansen, during which time the School
							Sisters of Notre Dame came to Lottaville. On November 6, 1905, the Rev. Frederick
							Koenig was appointed pastor of SS. Peter and Paul's Church at <pb id="VAB8203-244"
								n="244"/> Lottaville, which position he holds at the present time. He at once
							erected a suitable school-house, consisting of a basement, two school-rooms and a
							hall. Three School Sisters of Notre Dame have charge of the school, with an attendance
							of sixty-six pupils. The congregation has a cemetery of four acres. Besides this there
							are two acres, on which the church, the school-house, the priest's house and Sisters'
							residence have been erected.</p>

						<p>There is a debt of $3,500 on the church property. The parish has forty-eight

						<p>This mission comprised Indian Creek township, of Pulaski county, and had two distinct
							settlements, known as Pulaski and Indian Creek. The first Catholic settlers were
							Germans, arriving here about the year 1840. They came from northern Ohio, at the time
							of the construction of the canal through Logansport. The first baptism for the station
							Pulaski was recorded by the Rev. F. A. Carius on September 10, 1846, and the first
							baptism for Indian Creek by the Rev. E. M. Faller on September 2, 1851. These stations
							were visited by Rev. F. A. Carius 1846 till 1847, Rev. Patrick McDermott 1848 till
							1850, Rev. E. M. Faller and Rev. Philip O' Connell in 1851.</p>

						<p>In the year 1852, the first church, called St. Ann's and later St. Francis of
							Assissi, was erected. It was a frame building, 16x24 feet, and had in it one door and
							two windows. It was situated one mile west of the present Pulaski. When in 1870 a
							larger frame church was built, this smaller one was added to it, and used for a
							sacristy. The first church in the Indian Creek settlement was erected in 1855, and was
							enlarged in 1858. This location was abandoned in the year 1866, when a new frame
							church was built about two miles south of Pulaski. At the time these first churches
							were erected, Father Carius had charge of these missions. He was succeeded by Rev. <pb
								id="VAB8203-245" n="245"/> William Doyle, in 1855. Bishop Luers, in 1858, sent Rev.
							F. X. Nigh as the first resident pastor to Pulaski, with Indian Creek, Winamac,
							Monterey, etc., as missions. Father Nigh resided with a private family. His successor,
							in 1862, was Rev. Martin Kink, who did not reside here. One baptism, by Rev. B.
							Kroeger, is recorded in the fall of 1863. Rev. B. J. Force was pastor from 1864 to
							1866, during which time Rev. Joseph A. Winter also attended these missions. The
							pastorate of Rev. Henry Koenig extended from 1867 till the close of 1872. He bought
							one-quarter of an acre of ground, near the Indian Creek Church, and on it built the
							first priest's house, a small frame building. Rev. Bernard Wiedau was pastor from the
							close of 1872 till the summer of 1873.</p>

						<p>Bishop Dwenger, in the summer of 1873, gave the Fathers of the Congregation of the
							Most Precious Blood charge of the churches at Pulaski and Indian Creek. The first
							priest sent was Rev. Augustine Reichert, C. PP. S., who resided at Winamac, and from
							there attended these churches for about three months. After him came the following
							Fathers: Rev. Beatus Ziswyler, C. PP. S., from 1873 to 1874; Rev. Cosmas Seeberger, C.
							PP. S., in 1875; Rev. Theobald Schoch, C. PP. S., in 1876; Rev. John Frericks, C. PP.
							S., in 1877; Rev. Cosmas Seeberger, C. PP. S., again from 1878 till 1880; Rev. John
							Frericks, C. PP. S., again from 1881 till 1889; Rev. Frederick Baumgartner, C. PP. S.,
							in 1890; Rev. Raphael Schmaus, C. PP. S., from 1891 till 1893; Rev. J. Wilibald
							Sliemers, C. PP. S., from 1894 till 1896; Rev. Erhard Fritz, C. PP. S., from 1897 till
							June 1901; Rev. Martin L. Dentinger, C. PP. S., from 1901 till October 1903; Rev.
							Julian Meyer, C. PP. S., six weeks, in 1903; Rev. Anthony Dick, C. PP. S., from
							November 24, 1903 till September 30, 1905; Rev. Frank X. Schalk, C. PP. S., since
							October 1, 1905.</p>

						<p>When, in the year 1894, Bishop Rademacher visited these churches and saw how they
							were old and decaying and how inconveniently they were located, being only a few miles
							apart, he decided it would be best for both, if the two parishes were united into one,
							by building a church in Pulaski. Father Sliemers then bought two acres of land, on the
							east side of the Tippecanoe river, just opposite Pulaski, and on this site the present
							priest's house and a chapel were built, in 1895. The <pb id="VAB8203-246" n="246"/>
							Sisters of the Precious Blood, prior to 1890, had conducted a school at Indian Creek,
							but in that year abandoned the place for a lack of funds and of attendance. Steps
							however have been taken for the erection of a new school, in the near future.</p>

						<p>The corner stone for the new church was laid, on July 2, 1899, and the dedication
							took place on May 20, 1900, Father Fritz being the pastor. The building is of brick
							with stone trimmings, measuring 45x90 feet, with a tower 100 feet high, and has a
							seating capacity of 350. The cost of the church, including furniture, was about
							$9,000. The church property has a debt of $600.</p>

						<p>St. Joseph's Church has the St. Rose's Young Ladies' Sodality and the Sodality of the
							Blessed Virgin, for Married Women. The number of souls in the parish is about 500,

						<p>In the thirties, of the last century, Mr. Comparet established a trading post between
							Kendallville and Rome City, where the settlers and the Indians were accustomed to
							meet. It was here, that Father Badin paid occasional visits to the few Catholics, not
							numbering more than eight families. Father Lalumiere's name is still mentioned
							reverently as another of the pioneer missionaries. Rev. Alphonse Munschina visited the
							place, at a later date, attending to the spiritual wants of the Catholics in and about
							Avilla. After him came, at intervals, the Rev. Louis Mueller, resident at Fort Wayne,
							from 1836 until 1840. Father Benoit paid frequent visits to Avilla. The visits had to
							be made on horseback.</p>

						<p>Mass was celebrated at Avilla, either in the log house of John Geiser or of Frank
							Borck. Rev. Joseph Rudolph also visited Avilla from Fort Wayne. The eight Catholic
							families, at that time living in or near Avilla, were organized into a congregation by
							Rev. Edward M. Faller, pastor at Fort Wayne, in 1853, and placed under the patronage
							of the Blessed Virgin <pb id="VAB8203-247" n="247"/> Mary. The land for the new church
							was donated by John Geiser; it was on the site of the present cemetery. A frame
							building, 25x36 feet, to serve as a church, was erected on the land donated and was
							dedicated by Bishop de St. Palais, in 1853.</p>

						<p>Avilla received its first resident pastor in 1858, in the person of Rev. Henry
							Schaefer. The sphere of labor, assigned to him, extended from Elkhart county to the
							Ohio State line, and from Allen county north to the Michigan State boundary. Rev.
							Francis Deipenbrock was appointed to succeed Father Schaefer, in 1863. The little
							church having become entirely too small, he built an addition of twenty feet to it.
							Rev. John Wemhoff took charge in December, of the same year, and remained until
							December 1865. The Rev. A. B. Oechtering had charge until May 12, 1867.</p>

						<p>The Rev. Dominic Duehmig arrived in Avilla on February 22, 1867, and on May 12th, of
							the same year, was installed as pastor of the Church of the Assumption at Avilla, and
							continued as such until June 3, 1905, the date of his death. Father Duehmig found his
							parish to consist of about forty families, and a little building 18x24 feet, serving
							as a school, with an attendance of only seventeen children. Father Duehmig at once
							added twelve feet to this building. He secured the services of John Everhardy as
							teacher, who was later succeeded by August Vogeding, who was organist of the church
							for twenty-eight years, and then by Edward Spoth, who had become a famous composer of
							church music. In 1872 the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ taught the school for some
							time, until the Sisters of St. Francis of the Sacred Heart took charge.</p>

							one-quarter acres of land, located about one-quarter of a mile south of where the
							first church stood, the majority of the members of the congregation decided to build
							the new church on this ground. The corner stone of the new church was laid, by Father
							Duehmig, in the fall of 1876. The new church is a beautiful brick building, 44x113
							feet in size, and owing to careful supervision and management, including the
							frescoing, the pews and stained glass windows, cost only $8,600. Bishop Dwenger
							dedicated it on May 19, 1878. The church is of Roman architecture, with a seating
							capacity <pb id="VAB8203-248" n="248"/> of 400. The pulpit and the side altars were
							placed in 1880, the pipe organ in 1885, and the main altar in 1895.</p>

						<p>The new school house was erected in 1878. An addition, 30x36 feet was built in 1900,
							thereby enlarging the Sisters' dwelling, and providing a little chapel for their use.
							One hundred and fourteen children are on the school roll, taught by three Sisters. A
							commodious priest's house was erected south of the church, in 1889, at an outlay of
							$3,600. In 1895 Father Duehmig became largely instrumental, in supplying the buildings
							of the Old Peoples' Home, with a more modern structure. In the year 1904, Father
							Duehmig erected a Mortuary Chapel in the cemetery and named it the Chapel of the
							Immaculate Conception, in commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of the definition of
							that dogma. Father Duehmig did not live to see it entirely finished. He departed this
							life, as already stated, on June 3, 1905.</p>

						<p>Four great events have been specially commemorated in St. Mary's parish. First, the
							Silver Jubilee of Pope Pius IX, in 1871. Second, the Silver Jubilee of Rev. D.
							Duehmig, in 1891. Third, the Fourhundredth Anniversary of the Discovery of America, in
							1892. Fourth, the Pontifical Silver Jubilee of Leo XIII.</p>

						<p>The congregation has the following societies: The Rosary Society, for married women,
							seventy-seven members; St. Joseph's School Society, for married men, fifty-eight
							members; the Young Men's Sodality, for single men, sixty-six members; the Young
							Ladies' Sodality, for single women, sixty-six members; the Holy Childhood, for
							children, one hundred and ninety members; the Society for the Propagation of the
							Faith, sixty members; the Apostleship of Prayer, three hundred and seventy members;
							the Confraternity of the Scapular of Mount Carmel, fifty-six members; and the C. K. of
							A., forty-two members.</p>

						<p>On July 1, 1905, the Rev. John H. Bathe took charge of the parish. Father Bathe
							cleared up the financial affairs of the congregation and on October 3, 1905, having
							finished the Mortuary Chapel, dedicated it.</p>

						<p>Assistant priests at St. Mary's, in the order given, were: Rev. M. Zumbuelte, Rev.
							Louis A. Moench, Rev. Maurice Helferich, O. S. B., Rev. Henry Meissner, Rev. George
							Lauer, Rev. John Schmitz, and Rev. William C. Miller.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-249" n="249"/>

						<p>St. Mary's Church has given three of her sons to the priesthood and fifteen of her
							daughters have entered the religious state of life. The parish at Avilla has
							eighty-six families, numbering 509 souls. The debt on the church property is

							1853.</head>

						<p>The Government had a land office located where Laporte now is, for the purpose of
							disposing of the land, in the year 1833. Settlers had arrived here as early as 1830.
							The town was surveyed in the year 1833. The first railroad to enter into Laporte was,
							what is now known as the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, in 1852, and extended to
							Chicago the following year. The Lake Erie railroad was built between Laporte and
							Plymouth in 1856, and in 1871 the branch to Michigan City. With the building of the
							railroads Catholic families settled in Laporte. In those days, priests from Notre Dame
							visited the place at regular intervals, and Mass was celebrated in private houses.
							Mass was also celebrated in the old university building, better known as the Medical
							College, which was situated on the site of the present "Central School Building." Mass
							was even said in the old Methodist church, located on the northeast corner of
							Jefferson and Monroe streets. In the history of Laporte, by Packard, we read; <q>"The
								existence of St. Peter's Church is almost coeval with that of the city of
								Laporte."</q> An old baptismal record, and old records prior to 1870 show, that this
							church was formerly called the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>

						<p>In 1849, the Holy Cross Fathers visited Laporte, and said Mass once a month in a
							little school-house, at the west end of Harrison street. When no opportunity for Mass
							was given in Laporte, people would travel twelve miles over sandy and rough roads to
							Michigan City, to assist at the Holy Sacrifice. Many of them would go to Notre Dame to
							receive the Sacraments. The Holy Cross Fathers travelled, either in cumbersome farm
							wagons or on horse back to reach Laporte.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-250" n="250"/>

						<p>Rev. M. P. Rooney built the first church, 30x40 feet, part of which is still
							standing. It was erected between 1853 and 1854 and was very primitive. The faithful
							knelt upon mother earth, the altar was constructed of dry goods boxes, confessions
							were heard by the priests sitting on the altar steps. Later on, Rev. Francis Lawler
							added wings to the building, and to the rear of the church annexed the priest's house.
							Here the priests lived until 1880, when Rev. M. E. Campion built the present house, at
							a cost of $1,793. Rev. John Crawley remodeled the church, in 1893, and built a
							steeple: but he did not live to celebrate Mass in the church he had beautified.</p>

						<p>From the year 1840, Rev. F. Cointet, C. S. C., Rev. A. Shortis, C. S. C., and Rev. C.
							Schilling, C. S. C., visited Laporte and vicinity. Father Rooney was the first
							resident pastor. After him came Rev. R. Wallace, C. S. C., and Rev. B. J. Force, C. S.
							C. From 1854 to July 1859, Rev. E. B. Kilroy was pastor. Father Kilroy was succeeded
							by the Rev. Francis Lawler, the first secular priest in charge of this parish. Rev.
							Timothy O'Sullivan was pastor here from 1870 until June 1880. He also visited the
							missions Walkerton, Wanatah and Westville. During his time the Lake Shore railroad
							shops were moved from Laporte, causing an enormous decrease in the Catholic
							population. Father O'Sullivan was succeeded by the Rev. M. E. Campion in June 1880,
							remaining until May 1883. He built the frame pastoral residence. Rev. James A. Twigg
							came next, from the spring of 1883 until the fall of 1884, when he was succeeded by
							Rev. J. B. Crawley. The latter contracted pneumonia when the remodeled church was
							dedicated, and died on December 19, 1893. Until October 1897 Rev. John Grogan was the
							pastor, when he was compelled to resign owing to bad health. The present pastor was
							appointed on October 9, 1897, his name is Rev. George M. Schramm.</p>

						<p>The present church property has 188 feet front on Monroe street. The ground was
							secured by the founder of Notre Dame. The seating capacity of St. Peter's Church is
							400.</p>

						<p>Brother Daniel, C. S. C. taught school, in 1855, using the church for a school-room.
							In the spring of 1856 school was taught in a building, located where now the priest's
							house stands. Later on, the Sisters bought the Walker homestead, situated on Ridge
							street, the ground comprising an entire <pb id="VAB8203-251" n="251"/> block, and
							located at a distance of about five blocks from the church. The old school building
							was moved to this place, and here the Sisters opened an academy for girls, though it
							is the parish school also. The school having become too small, it is being enlarged,
							at the present time. These sisters are Sisters of the Holy Cross. They reside in the
							convent, annexed to the school, which was formerly the old Walker residence.
							Non-Catholics also send their daughters to this school, which is called St. Rose's
							Academy.</p>

						<p>St. Peter's Aid Society for Men, with a membership of fifty-two, was organized in
							1901. Its object is to unite the men of the parish and afford relief in time of need.
							The Rosary Society, for married Women, was first called the altar society organized in
							1855, and has a membership of ninety-one. The Sodality of the Children of Mary,
							established in 1882, has eighteen members. In 1903, the St. Aloysius Society was
							organized, with a present membership of twenty. The Young Ladies' Sodality of the
							Immaculate Conception has seventy members. The number of families is 162, numbering
							654 souls. The debt on the church property is $1,000.</p>

						<p>Millcreek and Stillwell are stations, attended from Laporte. The pioneer pastors of
							Laporte had the care also of Chesterton, Warsaw, Walkerton, Wanatah and Westville, at
							different times.</p>

						<p>A statement concerning St. Peter's Church at Laporte, dated July 26, 1872, made by
							Rev. Timothy O'Sullivan to Bishop Dwenger, presents some interesting items. A few may
							be given: <q>"Value of church property $6,375. Number of Full Families, including
								Walkerton, Fish Lake and Eastward on Railroad about 105, of these forty-five
								families do little or nothing for the church; some of them scarcely ever make their
								appearance in church. Families of Widowers or Widows, twenty-two, of which eleven
								pay little or nothing towards the support of the church. Parties married to
								non-Catholics five, of which three do nothing for the church. One woman has become
								an infidel. Young women or men working for themselves fifteen, of these six pay
								nothing or very little. Since my arrival at Laporte, about twenty-seven families
								have moved away. One or other of the parties is German. We have a parochial school
								and an Academy of the Sisters of Holy Cross. Income: Pew rents about $600. Sunday
								collections <pb id="VAB8203-252" n="252"/> $140. My salary here has been $600 a
								year. Since I received charge of Chesterton, I always try to supply my place here on
								Sundays by a priest from Notre Dame."</q></p>

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">SOUTH BEND.</hi><lb/> ST. JOSEPH'S CHURCH.<lb/>
							1853.</head>

						<p>The history of the Catholic Church in South Bend dates back to 1680. In this year,
							Rev. Claude Allouez, S. J., erected a most primitive chapel on the borders of St.
							Mary's lake, of the present Notre Dame. At that time it was principally the
							Pottawottamie Indians, who worshipped here. After the death of Father Allouez, which
							occurred in 1689, came Rev. James Gravier, S. J., who in turn was succeeded by Rev.
							Claude Aveneau, S. J., when, in 1759, the fort on St. Joseph's river was reduced by
							English soldiers, and the survivors were taken prisoners and were carried away to
							Quebec. The mission was then entirely deserted, until it was reorganized by Rev.
							Stephen Theodore Badin, who built here a log chapel in 1830, 24x40 feet, which served
							for church and priest's residence. Father Badin labored here until 1832, when Rev.
							Louis de Seille took up the missionary work in these regions, from 1832 to 1837. The
							youthful, newly ordained priest, Rev. Benjamin M. Petit was Father de Seille's
							successor, from 1837 to February 10, 1839, the date of his death. For three years
							thereafter, the Catholic Indians, and others living in these regions, were attended by
							missionaries from different parts at irregular intervals. From November 26, 1842 until
							the present day, however, the Catholics of South Bend have been served faithfully by
							Fathers of the Congregation of the Holy Cross. It was on the date mentioned, that Rev.
							Edward Sorin, C. S. C., with six Brothers arrived and founded Notre Dame.</p>

						<p>Until the year 1853 the Catholics of that part of South Bend known as Lowell,
							worshipped in the chapel at Notre Dame: but in the year mentioned, Father Sorin
							erected a brick structure, 22x40 feet, on ground which had been secured in 1847,
							consisting of three lots located on the south-east corner of Hill street and La Salle
							avenue. The addition of a kitchen <pb id="VAB8203-253" n="253"/> and dining room is
							still standing. A second story was added on this building in 1882. Divine services
							were held here by priests from Notre Dame, and the school was taught in the same
							building by Sisters of the Holy Cross. This building was known first as St. Alexius'
							School and Chapel, and later as the Academy of the Assumption. The priests who
							attended St. Alexius' Chapel from Notre Dame were: Rev. Edward Sorin, C. S. C., Rev.
							Alexius Granger, C. S. C., Rev. Francis Cointet, C. S. C., Rev. Richard Shortis, C. S.
							C., Rev. Thomas Flynn, C. S. C., Rev. B. J. Force, C. S. C., Rev. J. Bourget, C. S.
							C., Rev. Z. Leveque, C. S. C., Rev. P. P. Cooney, C. S. C., Rev. Thomas Carroll, C. S.
							C., Rev. W. Corby, C. S. C., Rev. C. Exel, C. S. C., Rev. J. C. Carrier, C. S. C.,
							Rev. P. Hartlang, C. S. C., Rev. A. Lemonnier, C. S. C., Rev. S. Daugherty, C. S. C.,
							Rev. L. J. L'Etourneau, C. S. C., Rev. Julius Frere, C. S. C., and Rev. Louis Neyron.
							It was in the year 1867, that Father L'Etourneau began to take up a subscription for
							the new church, and how difficult it was in those days to collect money may be
							surmised from the fact, that in two years and four months he collected $748.83. The
							new church was erected on the corner of Hill street and LaSalle avenue, at a cost of
							$1,385.76. It was a frame building, 40x60 feet, and was completed in September 1868. A
							sacristy and one room were added to the rear of the church, and on July 1, 1869,
							Father Frere, became the first resident pastor of St. Joseph's Congregation. A paper,
							left by Father Frere, contains the census of the parish which he took up in 1868 and
							which records forty-seven families, with a total of 210 souls. Even in those early
							days St. Joseph's had flourishing societies: The Ladies of Nazareth, since 1860, who
							had charge of the sanctuary and altar, who, since 1890, have become members also of
							the Apostleship of Prayer, of the Living Rosary, of the Confraternity of the
							Immaculate Heart of Mary. The Children of Mary, since 1862. The St. Joseph's Society
							for Men since 1868, the strongest Catholic organization in South Bend in its day, it
							flourished until 1896. The St. Aloysius' Society for Boys, since 1868, known today as
							the Catholic Knight's Cadets. Father Oechtering of Mishawaka was want to say "that any
							priest may organize societies for boys, but that not even the grace of God can keep
							them up."</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-254" n="254"/>

						<p>In the fall of 1870, Rev. William Demers, C. S. C., was made the second resident
							pastor of St. Joseph's Church. He repaired and improved the church property, in many
							respects. On December 26, 1872, at high noon, the church burned down. The origin of
							the fire was not known at the time, but some years later, an unfortunate man on his
							death bed at Laporte, confessed to the deed. The Blessed Sacrament, the sacred
							vessels, the church books and the church vestments were saved, and the church was
							insured for $2,500. <q>"Even the famous reed organ was thrown down from the gallery,
								and out of the burning edifice. It survived the fall, but to judge from the groans
								which it now occasionally emits in the present St. Joseph's school, it never got
								over the shock."</q> The congregation now returned to the old St. Alexius' Chapel,
							with Rev. Peter Lauth, C. S. C., as their pastor and Father Sorin bought the block, on
							which St. Joseph's Hospital now stands. Here he erected a brick building, 32x50 feet,
							the upper story of which was used for a church, and the lower for a boys' school, with
							rooms for pastor and teachers. Father Lauth was pastor from January 1873 till
							September 1874, and was succeeded by Father L'Etourneau, who remained until September
							1875, when Father Lauth returned and was pastor till September 1876. Rev. William
							Demers, C. S. C., from September 1876 to September 1877; Rev. P. F. Veniard, C. S. C.,
							from September 1877 to July 1, 1880; Rev. Thomas Vagnier, C. S. C., from July 1, to
							August 1880; Rev. Michael Philip Fallize, C. S. C., from August 15, 1880 till the fall
							of 1888. Father Fallize was a most energetic pastor. Being himself a musician, the
							choir received his first attention. A new census taken by him revealed the necessity
							for a new church, and it was decided to put up a new church, on the site where the
							church had been destroyed by fire, in 1872. The present St. Joseph's Church was
							accordingly built, a brick structure, 51x149 feet, at a cost of $18,000. The
							corner-stone was laid at the close of July 1881, and the church was dedicated
							September 10, 1882. During the erection of the church, Rev. D. Hagerty was assistant
							to Father Fallize. In 1884 a two-story brick building, 30x60 feet, costing about
							$4,000, was provided for a boys' school and a hall. The school was taught by Brothers
							of the Holy Cross for two years, since which time the Sisters of the <pb
								id="VAB8203-255" n="255"/> Holy Cross have had charge of them. Father Fallize
							established the Catholic Knights of America, known as St. Paul's Branch, in 1885, and
							also the Total Abstinence Society, he being the State President for years. The next
							pastor was Rev. James Gleeson, C. S. C., from the fall of 1888 till August 1889. After
							him came Rev. N. J. Stoffel, C. S. C., who attended St. Joseph's from Notre Dame
							during one year, before he took up his residence at St. Joseph's. In the summer of
							1891 the boys' school and hall building was converted into a pastor's residence, at a
							cost of $1,355. Costly repairs and improvements were made, including a first-class
							furnace for the church. A children's fair held in 1900 netted $1,860. Alexius
							Coquillard, who died in February 1890, bequeathed $5,000 to St. Joseph's Church.
							Father Stoffel departed this life, on March 20, 1902.</p>

						<p>The next pastor of St. Joseph's Church, and who is the pastor at the present time, is
							the Rev. Peter Lauth, C. S. C., who took charge on April 5, 1902. Since his advent all
							but $1,200 of the old debt has been paid, and many repairs and necessary improvements,
							amounting to over $3,300, including new roofs on church and house, construction of
							sewer, paving of streets, frescoing of the church have been made. It is the intention
							to build a new parochial residence, in the near future. Besides the societies
							mentioned, St. Joseph's has at present the Holy Name Society, with fifty members, and
							the Holy Angels' Sodality, with 100 members. The records show that the parish includes
							about 330 families, with a total of 1,826 souls.</p>

						<p>St. Joseph's parochial school is attended by 306 children, in charge of seven Sisters
							of the Holy Cross. The church property has a debt of $1,200.</p>

							1854.</head>

						<p>In 1853, Bishop de St. Palais entrusted Rev. Philip Doyle with the organization of
							the German Parish in Lafayette. Two lots were purchased, and a substantial brick
							building was <pb id="VAB8203-256" n="256"/> erected, fronting on Tenth street, in
							1854, at a cost of $8,400. Rev. Pinkers, succeeding Father Doyle, erected a brick
							school building, fronting on Ferry street. Up to 1863, Rev. Neuber, Rev. John Wemhoff
							and Rev. Joseph Stephan were pastors, in the order named. After them came Rev. Francis
							Deipenbrock, during whose pastorate, the present St. Boniface's Church, situated on
							the corner of Ninth and North streets, was erected. The church is of Gothic
							architecture, 155x60 feet, and without tower and spire cost $28,762.</p>

						<p>In the beginning of 1866, Bishop Luers gave the Franciscan Fathers, of the Cincinnati
							Province, charge of St. Boniface's Church. Rev. Venantius Arnold, O. F. M., was made
							the first pastor, and Rev. William Gausepohl, O. F. M., his assistant. During that
							year the church was furnished with stained glass windows, and a magnificent Main
							Altar. At the same time, a two-story school building was erected on the foundation of
							the old church, on Tenth street. Rev. Dionysius Abarth, O. F. M., was pastor but on
							account of ill health had to retire, in 1870, when Rev. Accursius Beine, O. F. M.,
							succeeding him, furnished the church with a large pipe organ and two Gothic Side
							Altars. In 1871, the lot in the rear of the church was purchased for $1,600, and the
							present parsonage built on it for $5,000. Rev. Agnellus Fischer, O. F. M., was pastor
							of St. Boniface's Church, from 1878 to 1882, when he returned to Europe.</p>

						<p>During the pastorate of Rev. Daniel Heile, O. F. M., in 1883, a two-story brick
							building, adjoining the church on Ninth street, was erected, which has since then
							served as a boys' school. It was completed and furnished at a cost of $7,300. A
							dwelling for the teachers, Sisters of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis, was
							built in 1885, at the corner of Tenth and Ferry streets, costing $2,500. In the summer
							of 1887, the tower and spire of the church were completed for $2,000. Rev. Pius
							Niehaus, O. F. M., who had been the assistant at St. Boniface's Church since August
							1886, was made its pastor in 1887. He made various improvements on the church
							property. Rev. Ubaldus Webersinke, O. F. M., became pastor in 1891. Under him the
							interior of the church was beautifully ornamented at a cost of $3,000. With becoming
							solemnity, the people of St. Boniface's Church celebrated the <pb id="VAB8203-257"
								n="257"/> Silver Jubilee of the dedication of the present church, on Sunday December
							28, 1890.</p>

						<p>From 1892 until August 1897, Rev. Hilary Hoelscher, O. F. M., was the pastor. He gave
							the church fine stained glass windows, two exquisite statues of the Immaculate
							Conception and St. Joseph for the side altars, two confessionals of carved oak, and a
							new communion railing richly gilt and with a marble top. During the pastorate of Rev.
							Lucas Gottbehoede, O. F. M., the cemetery, known as St. Boniface Cemetery, consisting
							of twenty-three acres of land and located opposite Springvale cemetery, was secured
							and solemnly blessed on September 17, 1898, by Bishop Rademacher. The St. Joseph's
							Cemetery, consisting of five acres on the north-west corner of Greenbush and
							Seventeenth streets, had been used for the burial of the dead since 1862, and had
							become inadequate.</p>

						<p>A red letter day in the history of St. Boniface's Church will ever remain, Sunday
							September 24, of the year 1899, when the Most Rev. Archbishop Martinelli, Apostolic
							Delegate for the United States, in the presence of a vast congregation and a large
							number of clergy, solemnly consecrated St. Boniface's Church to the service of
							Almighty God. Extensive improvements had been made for the occasion, such as a new
							floor of quartered oak, new pews of the same material, the three fine Gothic altars
							redecorated in white and gold, together with their statuary, the pulpit better located
							and redecorated, chandeliers and gas fixtures remodeled, in fact the interior of the
							entire church was made to appear as new. Somewhat later the walls of the church were
							tuck-pointed, giving the church the appearance of being newly built of pressed brick.
							The Rev. Francis de Paul Lotz, O. F. M., became pastor in September 1900. His
							pastorate was distinguished by various improvements of the church property, notably
							the lighting of the church by electricity, and the artistic stone crucifixion group in
							the cemetery. The present pastor, Rev. Leonard Nurre, O. F. M., took charge in
							September 1903. A notable event of his pastorate was the solemn celebration of the
							Golden Jubilee of the foundation of the parish, on October 23, 1904. Bishop Alerding
							celebrated the Pontifical Mass, assisted by all the former pastors still living, and
								<pb id="VAB8203-258" n="258"/> by a number of other Franciscan Fathers; the Very
							Rev. Provincial Chrysostom Theobald preached the sermon. Father Leonard has been
							especially active in making his parish schools the very best. The eight grades are
							taught in it: the larger boys by an efficient lay teacher, the other classes by six
							Franciscan Sisters. The number of pupils is 238.</p>

						<p>The following were the assistants at St. Boniface's Church: Rev. William Gausepohl,

						<p>In the memory of the oldest living members of St. Ann's Church, Rev. Francis Anthony
							Carius was the first priest to visit Monterey, from Logansport, every three months and
							celebrating Mass in the houses of Martin Keller, and others, from the year 1852 to
							1855. In the latter year, Rev. F. X. Nigh, residing at Winamac, built a little frame
							church, about two and one-half miles north-west of Monterey, on the banks of the
							Tippecanoe river. Four acres of ground had been secured here, November 26, 1851.
							Father Nigh continued to visit Monterey (Buena Vista) for a few years after which from
							1863 until 1867, it became a mission attended by the pastors of Plymouth: Rev. Gabriel
							Volkert and Rev. George Steiner. From 1867 till 1872, St. Ann's was visited by Rev.
							Henry Koenig and Rev. B. Wiedau, from Winamac, after which Rev. George Zurwellen
							visited it, from Plymouth, and from January 1873 till September Father Wiedau. From
							1873 till 1888, ten different Fathers, C. PP. S., had the care of Monterey: Rev.
							Beatus Ziswyler, 1873 to 1875, who organized the Married Ladies' Altar Society, the
							St. Mary's Young Ladies' Society and the St. Aloysius Young Men's Society. Then came
							the Rev. Cosmas Seeberger, C. PP. S., Rev. Theobald Schoch, C. PP. S., Rev. John
							Frericks, C. PP. S., Rev. Rudolph Abbrederis, C. PP. S., Rev. Conrad Schneider, C. PP.
							S., and Rev. <pb id="VAB8203-260" n="260"/> Christian Nigsh, C. PP. S. Rev. George
							Fleisch, C. PP. S., who came in September 1880, was the first resident pastor and
							remained for five years. He bought the present church lots in Monterey, in the fall of
							1882. The corner-stone of the new brick church, in Monterey, was laid in the summer of
							1883, on which occasion Rev. Henry Meissner preached the sermon. Bishop Dwenger
							dedicated the new church in May, 1884. The cost of this church, including the most
							necessary furniture, was $6,746.25. In January, 1886, Father Fleisch was succeeded by
							Rev. Erhard Fritz, C. PP. S., the last Father, C. PP. S., in charge of Monterey.</p>

						<p>The Rev. Charles Thiele, newly ordained, was the pastor of St. Ann's Church, from
							July 1888 till August 1898. The priest's house of brick was built in 1889, and with
							the furniture cost $1,865. In 1891, the church was frescoed for $439. In 1895, a new
							brick school, hall and Sisters' dwelling combined was erected on lots, opposite the
							church, donated by P. A. Follmar. The building cost $2,700, and Bishop Rademacher
							dedicated the same in the fall of the same year. Sisters of St. Agnes of Fond du Lac,
							Wisconsin, were installed as teachers. The average daily attendance at school is
							seventy-five pupils. When in August, 1898, Father Thiele was removed, the debt on the
							church property was $2,275. Rev. Gregory A. Zern was the next pastor, for two years,
							and during his time three acres of ground were bought for $300, one-fourth of a mile
							west of town, for cemetery purposes. The first interment was that of August Fox, on
							May 1, 1899, from whom the ground had been bought. Father Zern made some necessary
							repairs and improvements on the church and house, and, when in October, 1899, he was
							removed, he left a debt of $2,863.20 after him.</p>

						<p>The Rev. F. Joseph Bilstein, the present pastor, officiated for the first time, in
							St. Ann's Church, on Rosary Sunday, October 7, 1899. Under his administration the
							entire debt was wiped out. St. Ann's has the Married Ladies' Rosary Society, with
							fifty-five members; the St. Mary Young Ladies' Sodality, with forty-three members; the
							St. Joseph Young Men's Society, with twenty-three members; the Catholic Order of
							Foresters, with twenty-eight members. The number of souls is 412, constituting
							sixty-eight families.</p>

						<p>The first settlers of what was then known as New France, were emigrants from the
							eastern part of France, and the parish of today is made up almost exclusively of the
							descendants of these early settlers. When the early days of church life in this
							settlement are spoken of the names of the missionaries frequently mentioned, are
							Fathers Deschamp, Botti, and Grevin. As a mission, St. Vincent was attended from the
							Cathedral at Fort Wayne, especially by Father Benoit. Alexander Pichon donated the
							church grounds, about two acres of land. The first church was a log structure, and
							stood in the middle of of what is now St. Vincent's Cemetery. It is not known when
							this first church was built, nor by whom. The second church was a frame structure
							erected by the Rev. August Adam, in the year 1861, at a cost of $1,476, the
							congregation furnishing the lumber and the greater part of the labor. The church was
							dedicated on All Saints' day. Father Adam also built the pastoral residence still in
							use, in the year 1868. The third and present church was erected in 1904, during the
							pastorate of Rev. M. P. Louen. It is a brick structure, after the Roman style of
							,architecture and, inclusive of furniture, cost approximately $12,000. The seating
							capacity is 350, exclusive of gallery. The present indebtedness of the parish is
							$1,100.</p>

						<p>The Sacred Heart Academy building was put up, in the year 1866, by and is under the
							direction of, the Sisters of the Holy Cross. A small brick building, adjoining the
							Academy, is used for a parish school, attended by thirty pupils.</p>

						<p>We gather from the baptismal records, that the pastors of St. Vincent's Church were
							the following: Rev. Francis Deschamp, 1856 till 1858; Rev. Alexius Botti, 1858 till
							1860; Rev. Grevin, 1860 till 1861; Rev. August Adam, 1861 till 1870; Rev. Julius

							1856.</head>

						<p>As far back as 1852, it is of record that Rev. John Quinlan, afterwards Bishop of
							Mobile, Alabama, visited the Catholic families of Union City and vicinity. He
							administered to their spiritual wants until 1854, and was succeeded by the Rev. Sheon,
							the resident pastor at Sidney, Ohio. In 1855, we find the name of Rev. J. B. Hemsteger
							of Piqua, Ohio, attending Union City, as a station.</p>

						<p>As a mission Union City was visited from Piqua, Sidney and Greenville, Ohio, for a
							number of years. The first church was a chapel, erected on the farm of Joseph Wise,
							about two miles east of town, under the supervision of Rev. McClare, in the year 1856.
							Father Hemsteger again had charge from 1857 to 1860. He was succeeded by Rev. Thripe
							of Piqua, Ohio, and soon after, by Rev. Shelhammer of Greenville, Ohio. The number of
							Catholics was rapidly increasing, and in 1865 a brick church, with a seating capacity
							of 250, was erected on Plum street. At the present time this building is used as a
							hall and chapel. Rev. John McMahon was in charge of St. Mary's Parish, from 1862 till
							1867. When the diocese of Fort Wayne was established, in 1857, every doubt was removed
							as to whether St. Mary's Church was in the archdiocese of Cincinnati or, what was up
							to that time, the diocese of Vincennes. From 1857 St. Mary's Parish has been attended
							by priests of the Fort Wayne diocese.</p>

						<p>Rev. Lawrence Lamoor was the pastor from 1867 till 1870. After him Rev. Frederick Von
							Schwedler had charge, and was succeeded by Rev. Martin Noll, who attended to <pb
								id="VAB8203-263" n="263"/> Union City from 1872 till 1875. During the pastorate of
							Rev. Jeremiah Quinlan, which extended from 1875 till 1890, funds were being collected
							for the erection of a new church, as the old church was too small to accommodate the
							congregation. The number of souls at this time had increased to 650. Father Quinlan's
							successor was the Rev. Francis A. King, who was the pastor from 1890 till 1899. It was
							under his pastorate, that the present church, on the corner of Plum and Hickory
							streets, with a seating capacity of 600, was begun and completed before the close of
							1892, at a cost of $25.000. The Rev. Michael Byrne was the pastor at Union City, from
							1899 till the spring of 1901, since which time the present pastor, the Rev. John
							Durham, has had charge of the congregation. The church property, situated in the
							center of the city, consists of four lots or a half block, on which are the beautiful
							brick church, the school-house, a hall and chapel,, the priest's and the Sisters'
							residences. A commodious new school-house and Sisters' house is being erected at the
							present time.</p>

						<p>The parish has a Rosary Society of one hundred and forty-three members; a Young
							Ladies' Sodality of sixty-five members; a Columbian Literary Club of eighty members;
							the Holy Angels' Sodality of ninety members; the Knights of Columbus of one hundred
							members and also the Catholic Benevolent Legion.</p>

						<p>The Sisters of the Holy Cross conduct the school, which is attended by eighty-one
							pupils. The parish has 126 families, numbering 580 souls. When the erection of the new
							school was begun in 1907, St. Mary's church was out of debt, and had about '500 in the
							treasury, not counting a liberal subscription.</p>

						<p>The mission, St. Joseph's Church, at Winchester, is attended from Union City.</p>

						<p>These parts were visited as early as 1855, as a station, by priests who, for the most
							part, were located at Logansport. The names of priests given in this connection are:
							Rev. Francis Anthony Carius, about 1855; Rev. William Doyle, <pb id="VAB8203-264"
								n="264"/> Logansport, from 1855 to 1857; Rev. Charles T. Zucker, Logansport, from

							Logansport, from 1864 to 1868; Rev. Matthias Zumbuelte, assistant at Logansport, from
							1866 to 1868; Rev. Matthew E. Campion, Logansport, from April 1868 to January 1869.
							They came on horseback, over roads well nigh impassable, once a month and celebrated
							Mass in private houses. The families were few and scattered. In 1857 or 1858 Rev. F.
							X. Nigh, of Pulaski, induced the people to build a church. It was a plain, little
							frame building and the number of families, at this time, was about fifteen. The
							ground, on which this first church stood, contains about three acres, and where the
							present church stands is about two acres. The first mentioned three acres are used for
							cemetery purposes, and the new ground was bought by Rev. D. J. Mulcahy, in 1887. The
							present church was built in that same year, and is a plain, frame structure and cost
							probably $3,000. It seats about 300.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house was built by Rev. John Dempsey, containing three rooms, and
							was added to from time to time; and, after doing service for thirty years, was sold by
							Rev. M. J. Ford for $100. In 1902, Father Ford erected the present pastoral residence,
							which, including furnishings, cost about $3,000. There is no debt on the church
							property. The number of souls is 300, constituting thirty-seven families. One girl of
							the parish has entered the convent.</p>

							1858.</head>

						<p>It was in 1824, Joseph Bailey, a Frenchman, brought his family to northern Indiana
							and settled about a mile west of the present Chesterton, at a point known to this day
							as Baileytown. It is said he came in fulfillment of a vow for deliverance from extreme
							peril. From 1824 to 1841, Bailey's house was the home of the Catholic Church in Porter
							county. The present Chesterton was in the beginning known as Coffee-creek; it was an
							Irish settlement, and a station on the Lake Shore railroad, in 1851. In 1855 its name
							was changed to Calumet. Up to 1858, Fathers of the Holy Cross, from Notre Dame,
							attended to the spiritual needs of Catholics in these regions.</p>

						<p>In 1858, Rev. E. B. Kilroy built a small frame church, and thereafter Calumet was
							visited every month, from Laporte. After Father Kilrov came Rev. Paul Gillen, C. S.
							C., and then Rev. Francis Lawler. In 1869, the place received its present name,
							Chesterton. In 1868, in the month of September, Rev. John Flynn was appointed the
							first resident pastor of Chesterton. He also attended Walkerton every other Sunday.
							Father Flynn died on August 1, 1870, aged twenty-eight years; his remains were
							interred in the parish cemetery of Chesterton. From 1870 to 1875 Chesterton was again
							a mission, visited by <pb id="VAB8203-267" n="267"/> several priests, as may be
							ascertained from the baptismal records. The following names are found there: The Rev.
							William F. M. O'Rourke, Rev. F. M. Lawler, Rev. Timothy O'Sullivan, Rev. Michael
							O'Reilly, Rev. P. Koncz, and Rev. C. Wardy. From March, 1875, Chesterton has had
							resident pastors up to the present time. Rev. John F. Lang was the pastor from March
							1875 to March 1878. In August 1879, the Rev. H. F. Joseph Kroll took charge of St.
							Patrick's Church.</p>

						<p>In mission days, James Moroney's house was the home of visiting priests. The first
							church built, in 1858, was located quite a distance from Chesterton and too
							inconvenient for the attendance of the faithful. For this reason two lots were bought
							during Father Flynn's time. A portion of the present St. Patrick's Church was erected
							in 1874, Father O'Reilly, of Valparaiso superintending the work. When Father Kroll
							took charge, the church was a building devoid of every ornamentation or even the
							necessary furniture. He had the church frescoed, bought three beautiful altars and new
							pews, and built the tower, paying off all indebtedness. The spire alone cost $650. The
							Rev. Herman Juraschek, in 1902, enlarged the church by the addition of a transept and
							a spacious sanctuary, costing $5,635. New stained glass windows were provided at a
							cost of $425. Two furnaces were also put in. To provide the interior of the addition
							with necessary furniture, and to supply the sanctuary with what is required as well as
							the sacristy, and to build cement sidewalks and otherwise improving the church grounds
							necessitated an additional outlay of some $1,700. The seating capacity of the church
							is five hundred.</p>

						<p>The parish school had its beginning in 1887, when Father Kroll opened two class-rooms
							in the rear of the church, which arrangement continued until 1902. When Rev. F. Von
							Schwedler became the pastor of Chesterton, he had at his disposal $2,886.83, being
							principal and interest of a bequest made by Mrs. Rosa Howe to Father Kroll. This money
							was used in the erection of the present substantial St. Patrick's school, 60x45 feet.
							A memorial slab, bearing the donor's name, is found at the entrance. The lot, on which
							this school was built, was bought for $1,500, which money was given to the church, for
							funded masses. Having expended the bequest, a <pb id="VAB8203-268" n="268"/> balance
							of $1,715 remained due after the building had been erected. In 1904, an additional
							half lot was bought, cement walks were built, and further supplies for the school had
							to be purchased. The building has a fine basement used as a club room for the young
							men; the main floor has three school-rooms with a large hall on the second floor, and
							a special room for society meetings and library. The parochial school teaches the
							eight grades, is conducted by three School Sisters of Notre Dame and is attended by
							seventy-seven pupils. Their support is given them from the church revenue. Some twenty
							non-Catholic children attend the school. The Sisters' residence is one of the
							landmarks of the town. In 1907 a new and modern residence is being erected for the
							Sisters at an expense of $2,100.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house was also one of the landmarks, a very small building,
							consisting of one room and a kitchen. The first resident pastors lived in this house,
							as did also Father Kroll from 1879 to 1882. The present house was built in 1882 by
							Father Kroll at a cost of $2,400. Three hundred dollars have been spent on it since.
							The furniture of the house was for the most part donated. The debt on the church
							property is $3,000. There are ninety-three families, numbering 498 souls. One boy is
							preparing for the priesthood and three girls have become Sisters.</p>

						<p>The Married Ladies' Rosary and Altar Societies were organized in 1899, with sixty-two
							members, and in the same year the Young Ladies' Sodality, with forty-two members. The
							Married Men's Rosary Society was established in 1906, with thirty-five members. The
							Catholic Columbian League of Indiana began to exist in 1905, with thirty-six members.
							Aside from their spiritual purposes, these organizations assist the pastor in a
							financial way.</p>

							1858.</head>

						<p>It was about 1845 when missionaries began to visit Valparaiso, the name of one of
							these was Rev. F. Cointet, C. S. C. Priests from Notre Dame, namely, Rev. J. Curley,
							Rev. E. B. Kilroy and Rev. E. Leveque visited the place, from 1853 till <pb
								id="VAB8203-269" n="269"/>\ 1857. They celebrated Mass in the old Court House on
							Washington street, and in a grove north-west of the city. The number of families at
							that time was twenty, mostly Irish, but a few French.</p>

						<p>Valparaiso became a mission in 1858, at which time the first church, a frame
							structure, 110x50 feet, costing $2,000 was erected during the pastoral attendance of
							Rev. Paul Gillen. The same was made the first resident pastor, residing in a small
							cottage south of the church. The church stood on the corner of Indiana avenue and West
							Chicago street. The construction of the Pennsylvania railroad brought many more Irish
							families, and that of the Grand Trunk road increased the number of the French
							families, making a total of about 200 families, or 900 souls. The resident pastors
							were: Rev. Paul Gillen, C. S. C., from 1857 till June 1858; Rev. John H. Force, from
							July 4, 1858 till December 27, of the same year; Rev. G. A. Hamilton, from January
							1st, till August 7, 1859; Rev. J Alexius Botti, from August 1859 till September 19,
							1862; after a vacancy of a few months came Rev. Michael O' Reilly, from January 17,
							1863 till August 4, 1887, the date of his death. Rev. John Dempsey, from August 25,
							1887 till May 1898. Rev. John H. Bathe, a short time. Rev. L. A. Moench, from July
							1898 till February 1903. Rev. William S. Hogan since February 26, 1903. Four lots,
							60x132 feet, facing West Chicago street, between Academy and Campbell streets, and two
							lots of the same dimensions on the corner of Campbell and West Chicago streets, were
							bought by Father O'Reilly, in 1866, for $1,800. The present priest's house, a

						<p>The corner-stone of the present church was laid by Bishop Dwenger, on October 8, 1883

							1859.</head>

						<p>As early as 1831, the settlement in the center of Hanover township was called Hanover
							Centre. In the beginning of 1843, a number of Catholic families purchased small farms,
							in this locality, attending divine service at St. John, Lake county. Four and one-half
							acres were donated by Matthias Geisen, and a subscription was taken up to raise funds
							to erect a church, in 1858, but the building was not completed until 1859. It was a
							small frame building, about 20x30 feet, to which a sacristy was added, for the
							accommodation of the visiting priest. It was called St. Matthias' Congregation. The
							Rev. F. X. Nigh organized the parish and visited it twice a month, attending also to
							Turkey Creek, Crown Point and Klaasville. Father Nigh was succeeded by the Rev. M. P.
							Wehrle, residing at Crown Point, and he in turn was succeeded by the Rev. Henry
							Renson. In 1866, Rev. Simon Bartosz planned a new priest's house, but, on account of
							some disagreement as to its locality, it was not built until 1867. It was a two-story
							frame structure, 22x30 feet. In the year 1866, the church, together with all that it
							contained, was destroyed by fire. The parishoners, however, were not to be
							discouraged. With renewed zeal <pb id="VAB8203-271" n="271"/> steps were taken to
							rebuild; and in 1868 a frame building, 36x66 feet, at a cost of about $3,000, was
							completed and called St. Martin's Church.</p>

						<p>In 1869, the Rev. Frank Siegelack was appointed the first resident pastor, of Hanover
							Centre, having Klaasville and Lowell as missions. Rev. F. X. Deimel succeeded Father
							Siegelack, in 1873, remaining till 1877, when he was transferred to the pastorate of
							Schererville. Father Deimel built a kitchen to the pastoral residence, in 1875, having
							the dimensions of 20x30 feet. In August 1877, Rev. William Berg was made its pastor,
							having only Hanover Centre to attend to. He purchased the old public school building,
							using the same for a summer school, for the Catholic children. This building is now
							the Sister's residence. Father Berg remained till June 9, 1881, when he was succeeded
							by Rev. Charles Steurer. At this time, the congregation numbered about sixty families.
							For six months the parish was left without a priest, and not until October 1889 did
							they receive a pastor. On that date, the Rev. Matthias Zumbuelte, the present pastor,
							received his appointment. During the night of July 9, 1902, the frame priest's house
							was struck by lightning, caught fire, and, together with its contents, was destroyed.
							The people, at once, set to work to provide a new residence, and in November, of the
							same year, Father Zumbuelte occupied the new building. The residence is equipped with
							modern conveniences, and cost about $3,000.</p>

						<p>The number of children being insufficient to continue the public school, the building
							was offered for sale to Father Zumbuelte. In September, of 1904, Father Zumbuelte
							purchased the building together with its furnishings. Not being able to procure
							Sisters to take charge of his school, he engaged a young Catholic woman. A new
							railroad was surveyed through the town, to pass through the building. The company
							agreed to move the building near the church, to build a new cistern and well at a cost
							of $750. The school-house is 40x60 feet, and valued at $2,500. In September 1905, two
							Sisters of St. Francis, of Lafayette, took charge of the school. They have eighty-one
							children in their care, and teach the eight grades.</p>

						<p>St. Martin's Church has the following societies: The <pb id="VAB8203-272" n="272"/>
							Young Mens' Sodality, the Young Ladies' Sodality, the Rosary Society, St. Martin's
							Society and the Catholic Order of Foresters, with a total of 156 members.</p>

						<p>In his last will, Hilary Roettgen bequeathed to St. Martin's Church the sum of
							$2,000, to be used for the erection of a new stone church. The congregation has
							sixty-two families, numbering 310 souls. The property consists of five and one-half
							acres. There is no debt on the church property.</p>

						<p>With the building of the Monon railroad, Catholics began to locate in Crawfordsville.
							The Rev. Michael J. Clark, of Lafayette, was the first priest to visit here,
							celebrating Mass in the Court House, about the year 1850. The first church was built
							on the north side of the town, about 1859. It was a frame structure, 75x40 feet,
							costing about $800. The present church property, at the corner of Washington and Pike
							streets, has a frontage of 110 feet on Washington street and runs back half a block on
							Pike street. The school property consists of one full lot on the corner of Main street
							and Grant avenue. The present church property was purchased by Rev. E. P. Walters who
							had charge from 1868 till 1878. Prior to that time, Rev. Edward O'Flaherty was the
							first resident pastor, from 1856 to 1864. He was succeeded by Rev. Charles Mougin,
							from 1864 to 1868. Father Walters erected the present church, from 1874 till 1876. It
							is built in the Gothic style of architecture, has a seating accommodation for about
							400 persons, and cost about $20,000. The Rev. John R. Dinnen, who was the pastor from
							1878 till 1894, furnished the church, built the priest's house, and purchased the
							school property on Main street. The Rev. P. J. Crosson, who had charge from 1894 till
							1898, repaired the damage done the church by fire, to the amount of $5,000, and also
							had the church frescoed. The Rev. John Dempsey, pastor, from 1898 till 1906, added to
							the sanctuary furnishings, reduced the church debt and looked after the public
							improvements ordered by the city. While celebrating a funeral Requiem, on April 4,
							1906, he dropped <pb id="VAB8203-273" n="273"/> dead while singing the Preface. His
							successor is the present pastor, the Rev. W. J. Quinlan.</p>

						<p>In 1866, the Sisters of the Holy Cross purchased a residence on Main street, at a
							cost of $3,500, and at an expense of $1,500 transformed the building into St. Charles'
							Academy. A little later Father Walters, having purchased the present church property,
							also erected a frame building on it and opened a parochial school, conducted by the
							Sisters of the Holy Cross. This served its purpose until the present church was to be
							built, when the pupils were looked after, at the Academy. This state of things
							continued until the present priest's house was built, when the old priest's house was
							turned into a boys' school and so continued until it was condemned by the Board of
							Health. In 1894 the congregation bought the Academy from the Sisters, since which time
							it has been St. Bernard's school. The Sisters of the Holy Cross are still in charge
							and two of them take the pupils, to the number of sixty, through the eight grades.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house, a frame building, stood adjacent to the first church on the
							north side. It was Father O'Flaherty who built it. The second priest's house fronting
							on Pike street, at the rear of the present church, was built by Father Walters. The
							present parochial residence was erected in 1886, at a cost of about $3,500. St.
							Bernard's parish has 120 families, numbering 450 souls. The Societies of the parish
							are the Rosary Society, the Young Ladies' Sodality, the St. Catharine's Society, the
							League of the Sacred Heart and the Purgatorian Society. One boy at the parish has
							become a priest and another boy, a member of the Holy Cross Community, is studying for
							the priesthood. Two girls of the parish are now Sisters of the Holy Cross. The debt on
							the church property, at the present time, is $2,450. The mission Ladoga is attended
							from Crawfordsville.</p>

						<p>It was the well known missionary, Rev. F. X. Weninger, S. J., who in 1859 persuaded
							the German portion of St. Peter's <pb id="VAB8203-274" n="274"/> congregation, at
							Laporte, to form a separate parish. The first pastor of this new congregation, which
							was placed under the patronage of St. Joseph, was the Rev. Martin Sherer, who built
							the present church and remained eight or nine years. Rev. N. Y. Konen succeeded him,
							for a short time. For three years and two months Rev. Simon Bartosz was pastor. In
							January 1870, the Rev. J. H. Oechtering took charge. He built the present priest's
							house, and added the steeple to the church. After a pastorate of fully ten years,
							Father Oechtering was succeeded by the Rev. Joseph Nussbaum, who bought the present
							cemetery, secured the Sisters' dwelling, procured a $1,500 pipe organ, frescoed the
							church and supplied the church with a full line of vestments. Father Nussbaum was a
							straight forward and outspoken man. He departed this life, as pastor of St. Joseph's,
							on December 26, 1895. For about six months thereafter, Rev. Julius Becks was pastor.
							After which time, owing to ill health, he was assigned to the hospital at
							Anderson.</p>

						<p>The parish school was taught by lay-teachers, from September 1880 to September 1896,
							when the Sisters C. PP. S. took charge. Two of these Sisters are at present teaching
							seventy-five children.</p>

						<p>The present pastor, Rev. Anthony Messmann, was appointed on July.9, 1896. During his
							pastorate new stained glass windows were placed in the church at an expense of $1,200.
							The church property has no debt on it. St. Joseph's parish has eighty-nine families,

						<p>New Haven was settled by Puritans, who came from the New England States as early as
							1839, when Henry Burgess laid out the town; but it was not incorporated until 1866.
							The first missionary Father, known to have visited New Haven, <pb id="VAB8203-275"
								n="275"/> was Rev. Alexius Botti, who came in the fall of 1858, and visited the
							place once a month for one year. From 1859 until September 1861, Rev. Grevin, residing
							at St. Vincent's, had charge of New Haven.</p>

						<p>The Rev. Wolfgang Giedl was the first resident pastor of New Haven, having Columbia
							City as a mission; he died on May 23, 1873, and his remains rest in the cemetery at
							New Haven. Rev. Sebastian Birnbaum C. PP. S. assisted Father Giedl during his illness,
							and after his death remained until a successor had been appointed, in the person of
							the Rev. Bernard Wiedau.</p>

						<p>The first services, held in New Haven, took place in the basement of Nick
							Schueckmann's house, and also in a rented dry goods store. Father Botti bought the
							goods, and the ladies made the vestments. The congregation, at the time, numbered
							twenty-three families. The old church, 30x60 feet, with a sacristy in the rear of the
							sanctuary, was erected in 1859, at a cost of $4,000. At this time, the parish numbered
							about 120 souls. Four lots of the church property were bought in 1859, for $300; four
							more in 1864, for $400, and in 1870 still two more at a cost of $500. On the latter
							two lots the present school-house was built, from 1872 to 1873. It is a two-story
							brick building and basement, 40x56 feet, having three school-rooms for 150 children,
							and a dwelling for the Sisters, costing $8,000. Several lay-teachers conducted the
							school, in a frame building 30x40 feet, till the year 1873, when the Sisters of St.
							Agnes took charge. The usual eight grades are taught, by three Sisters, attended by
							140 children.</p>

						<p>The present church is a Gothic structure, and was built from 1876 to 1877. It has
							been newly decorated and furnished with a fine $1,800 organ, two new side altars, an
							artistic communion table, a splendid pulpit, a fine baptistry, beautiful statuary and
							three harmoniously tuned bells. The church cost about $20,000, and has a seating
							capacity of at least 500; and is free from all indebtedness.</p>

						<p>The old church is used for society meetings, and for school and social
							entertainments. The parish at present has 114 families, numbering 508 souls. As many
							as twenty-four girls of the parish have joined religious communities.</p>

						<p>In 1863, the St. Mary's Altar Society was established, <pb id="VAB8203-276" n="276"/>
							and shortly after the St. Joseph's School Society. In 1866, St. John's Benevolent
							Society was organized; and, about thirty years ago, the St. Rose of Lima Young Ladies'
							Sodality. These societies have done much for the church, and for the upbuilding of the
							parish, both in a financial and a spiritual direction. The Benevolent Society, during
							its forty years of existence, has paid out $9,000, for sick benefits, and at present
							has $3,000 in the treasury. At present the following are the societies and the

						<p>Father Mayer in 1858 celebrated Mass at the house of Fred. Weaver. Sixteen families
							constituted the congregation at that time. He visited the place on the third Friday of
							each month, for several years. In 1859 Christian Miller donated three acres of land,
							on the east side of the Bluffton road, and in the same year a frame church, 29x36

						<p>In the year 1859, Rev. Thomas Carroll, C. S. C., built the first St. Patrick's
							Church, a small brick structure 60x30 feet, with a seating capacity of 350. To pay for
							the erection of this church, Father Carroll collected money abroad. During the
							pastorate of Rev. P. P. Cooney, C. S. C., 36 feet were added to the length of this
							building, and a wing of 50x32 feet, which for some years served as a school, and then
							as a place of worship for German and Polish Catholics, until they were able to provide
							a church for themselves. At this time, all the Catholics on the west side of the St.
							Joseph river, about 1,250 souls, belonged to St. Patrick's Church. Thomas Murphy was
							very kind to Father Carroll, and until the parochial residence was built, the pastor
							made his home with Mr. Murphy, whenever in town. This first St. Patrick's Church was
							located on Division street, and the Grand Trunk railroad, having secured right of way
							on this street, made the situation undesirable for church purposes. During the
							pastorate of Rev. D. J. Spillard, C. S. C., the property was sold for $8,000, and with
							it the present parochial residence was built.</p>

						<p>The present property of St. Patrick's parish, was purchased during the pastorates of
							Rev. D. J. Hagerty, C. S. C., and Rev. John W. Clark, C. S. C., for $7,200. It extends
							through from Taylor to Scott street 400 feet, and has a frontage of 140 feet on Taylor
							street, and 100 feet on Scott street. The corner-stone of the present church, which is
							the second of St. Patrick's <pb id="VAB8203-278" n="278"/> parish, was laid in 1886,
							and was completed the following year, Father Hagerty being the pastor. The church,
							with a seating capacity of 800, is of Gothic architecture, richly frescoed in cream
							and gold. All the furniture is of the best material and harmonizes with the
							architecture of the building. The church cost about $37,000, and the furnishings about
							$8,000. Many improvements have since been made to beautify the grounds, not to mention
							a thousand feet of cement walks, and an iron fence on Taylor street.</p>

						<p>The new St. Patrick's school, built in 1898 by Father Clark, measures 54x83 feet, and
							has three large class-rooms with accommodation for 150 children. The building also
							contains a large hall, a society room, and a well furnished gymnasium. Its cost was
							$14,000. This school is for boys only, who are taught by the Sisters of the Holy Cross
							in a course of eight grades. Adjacent to St. Patrick's Church is St. Joseph's Academy,
							conducted by the same Sisters, which serves also as a parochial school for the girls,
							261 pupils'attend the school. This property belongs to the Sisters, and was provided
							in 1886. The Sisters of the Holy Cross, who teach in South Bend, all reside at St.
							Joseph's Academy.</p>

						<p>The first parochial residence was next to the old St. Patrick's Church, on Division
							street, and was a very fine house at that time, 1865, having cost $8,000. The present
							parochial residence on Taylor street was erected by Father Spillard, in 1892, at a
							cost of $7,500. The debt on the church property is $4,000.</p>

						<p>The Sodality of the Children of Mary was organized in 1866, as well as the Holy
							Rosary Society, canonically established in 1892. The present pastor, Rev. John F.
							DeGroote, C. S. C., organized the St. Cecilia's Society for girls, up to their
							seventeenth year of age, after which they become Children of Mary. In 1904, he
							organized the Holy Name Society, and in 1905, the St. Vincent de Paul Conference. At
							present the number of souls in the parish is about 1,282, or 273 families. Three young
							men of the parish have become priests, and five of its young women have entered
							religious communities.</p>

						<p>St. Patrick's Church has had these pastors: Rev. Thomas Carroll, C. S. C., from 1858

							1860.</head>

						<p>As far back as 1837, priests residing in Logansport visited Anderson. Prior to that
							time, Rev. John Claude Francois and Rev. Vincent Baquelin celebrated Mass here in a
							log tavern. Rev. Michael J. Clark came, for several months in 1857, from Lafayette, to
							celebrate Mass in the Court House. The number of souls, almost exclusively Irish, was
							at this time about sixty. It was the same Father Clark who in 1858 laid the foundation
							for the first Catholic church in Anderson on the site of the present St. Mary's
							Church.</p>

						<p>Rev. FitzMaurice was the first resident pastor. He was succeeded by Rev. John
							McMahon, in 1860. He built the first church on the foundation laid by Father Clark. It
							was a 70x36 feet structure and cost about $2,000. The lot on which it stood was 72x144
							feet and cost $100. In 1865 Father McMahon left for Canada. Rev. J. B. Crawley was the
							pastor from 1866 until August 1884. He secured two more lots, 144x144 feet, at a cost
							of $1,000, and on July 4, 1875, laid the corner-stone of, and in due time finished,
							the second St. Mary's Church, which, for its day and the size of the congregation, was
							a splendid structure. He also built a parochial residence, a plain one-story frame
							building.</p>

						<p>Father Crawley was succeeded by Rev. F. C. Wiechmann, in August 1884, who during his
							pastorate built the present <pb id="VAB8203-280" n="280"/> parochial residence, a
							brick structure. About this time, the discovery of natural gas greatly increased the
							membership of St. Mary's Church. When on May 7, 1891, Rev. D. J. Mulcahy was appointed
							pastor, he determined at once to build a church, commensurate with the number and
							importance of his rapidly growing congregation. Accordingly, the first church built
							was removed, and on its site the corner-stone of the new, and third, and present St.
							Mary's Church was laid on July 9, 1893; and on October 6, 1895, Bishop Rademacher
							solemnly dedicated the new sacred edifice to the service of God. The church has a
							seating capacity of eight hundred, and is built in the Romanesque style of
							architecture. The interior decorations, the elegant stained glass windows and all the
							furnishings harmonize perfectly. The organ cost $2,500 and the fourteen Stations of
							the Cross, beautiful statue groupings, were added during the past year. The total cost
							of St. Mary's Church, as we see it today, was $55,000.</p>

						<p>St. Mary's Church has had its parochial school since 1869, but it was taught in very
							humble quarters, by lay-teachers. In September of 1879 the Sisters of the Holy Cross,
							at the request of Father Crawley, took charge of the parish school. They taught school
							in the first church building and lived in rented quarters, in the vicinity of the
							church, until, a new parochial residence having been erected, the old one became their
							place of residence. Having finished the new church, in 1895, Father Mulcahy determined
							to provide more suitable quarters for school and for the Sisters' residence. He
							succeeded in converting the old church into a school, with commodious class-rooms,
							together with a new two-story brick residence for the Sisters. This work was completed
							on February 2, 1898, and necessitated an outlay of $10,000. Six Sisters of the Holy

							CHURCH.<lb/> 1860.</head>

						<p>Columbia City, county seat of Whitley county, was visited for the first time in the
							spring of 1856, by the Rev. Edward M. Faller, pastor of St. Mary's Church, at Fort
							Wayne. He offered the Sacrifice of the Mass in a small frame house, occupied by Joseph
							Eich. Father Faller repeated these visits, from time to time, until the summer of
							1857, when Columbia City was made a mission, attended from Huntington, by the Rev. <pb
								id="VAB8203-282" n="282"/> F. Fuchs, pastor of SS. Peter and Paul's Church. Rev.
							Wolfgang Giedl, residing at New Haven, assumed charge from 1859 to the spring of 1860,
							when the Rev. Henry Schaefer bought ground, on Hannah street, and built a neat frame
							church, 30x50 feet, completing the same in the fall of 1860. He also built two
							one-story frame buildings, to serve as school and priest's residence. The labor and
							material were furnished by the parishoners.</p>

						<p>The church becoming too small to accommodate the faithful, and the location not being
							a desirable one, steps were taken to purchase a new site. In 1867, three lots, 150x150
							feet, located on South Lime street, were secured at a cost of $250. Plans and
							specifications were at once drawn up for a Gothic structure, 44x110 feet. The
							corner-stone was laid by Father Benoit on May 27th, of the same year. In October,
							1867, the new church was dedicated by Bishop Luers and placed under the patronage of
							St. Paul of the Cross. The cost of the church, including furniture, was about $12,000.
							The seating capacity is three hundred. Father Schaefer continued to live in the old
							priest's house until 1868, when he erected the present house, at a cost of about
							$1,500, material and labor being donated. The present pastor expended about $2,500 for
							new pews, stained glass windows, altars, Stations of the Cross, statuary and frescoing
							the church. He also equipped the residence with all modern conveniences. In 1870 Rev.
							Joseph Rademacher succeeded Father Schaefer, who in turn was succeeded by Rev.
							Matthias Zumbuelte from July 1872 to August 20, 1875; Rev. Peter Franzen temporarily;
							Rev. Henry A. Hellhake from October 1875 to May 1, 1886. Father Hellhake secured the
							Sisters of St. Agnes to take charge of the school.</p>

						<p>The first school was opened in September 1861. It was in charge of Peter Mettler,
							with an attendance of about twenty-eight pupils. Upon the completion of the new
							church, Father Schaefer purchased a lot opposite the church upon which there was a
							frame building. Having repaired and remodeled the same, it served the purposes of
							school and teacher's residence. On May 1, 1886, Rev. A. M. Ellering was made pastor.
							Seeing the necessity for more suitable school accommodations, he at once began the
							erection of a new school building. A beautiful structure of red brick and sand stone
							trimmings, 34x54 feet, <pb id="VAB8203-283" n="283"/> with slate roof, was completed
							in December of the same year. The first floor contains two school-rooms, 25x30 feet,
							hall way and cloak room; the second floor has a large assembly hall and ante-room. The
							cost of the building together with the furniture was about $5,200. Since September 15,
							1880, one Sister of St. Agnes, of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, has had charge of the
							school. The eight grades are taught. At present the school is attended by forty-six
							pupils. The school is supported by monthly tuition and voluntary donations. The
							Sisters occupy the old school-house, which has been remodeled for a dwelling at a cost
							of $400. The congregation is free from all indebtedness. The number of souls is 312,
							consisting of sixty-two families. Three girls of the parish have entered religious
							communities.</p>

						<p>St. Paul's Church has the following Societies: Catholic Knights of America,
							established in 1880, with seventeen members; the Married Men and Young Men's Society,
							with thirty-nine members; the Rosary Society for married women, with forty-one
							members, and the Young Ladies' Sodality, with twenty-eight members. Aside from their
							spiritual purposes, these organizations assist the pastor in a financial way.</p>

						<p>The pastor at Columbia City also attends the mission Warsaw, visiting it on the
							fourth Sunday of every month, and occasionally on week days.</p>

							Clark, of Lafayette; Rev. D. Maloney, of Lafayette; Rev. Joseph Stephan, of
							Rensselaer; Rev. John McMahon, of Lafayette; Rev. William Doyle, of Logansport; Rev.
							J. A. Winter, of Lafayette. Services were held once a month in the old Delphi House.
							The number of souls at this time was about 150, two-thirds of them Irish and one-third
							German and French. A brick building, 35x40 feet, was bought in 1860 for $900. The
							priests visiting Delphi, as a mission, were Rev. George A. Hamilton, from June 8,
							1860, to January 31, 1861; Rev. John Vahey from February 1, 1861 to May 19, 1861; Rev.
							William Gausepohl, O. S. F., of Lafayette, from <pb id="VAB8203-284" n="284"/> January
							21, 1866 to December 1866; the latter visited Delphi every Sunday. By this time the
							number of souls had increased to 250.</p>

						<p>The church grounds consist of five lots, of 30x120 feet each. The first lot was
							bought April 19, 1860, for $500, the second April 27, 1863 for $800, and the three
							other lots April 20, 1899. These three lots with the Sisters' house cost about $3,000.
							About ten acres of ground were acquired, October 5, 1887, for $1,000; this ground is
							used for cemetery purposes.</p>

						<p>The foundation of St. Joseph's Church was laid by Father Vahey in March and April
							1860, and Father Hamilton built the church in the fall of the same year. It was
							dedicated by Bishop de St. Palais, Bishop Luers being present, on February 9, 1861.
							The building is of brick, 45x90 feet, Gothic architecture and cost $9,000. The first
							building bought and used for divine services was now sold for $700. Rev. John
							Bleckmann had the church frescoed, he also procured a church bell and an organ. Rev.
							Charles Romer had it redecorated in 1894, put in a furnace in 1898, and completed the
							steeple in 1899. Rev. Edward Boccard secured a new altar, put in electric lights,
							baptismal font and holy water basins. The seating capacity of the church is 400.</p>

						<p>The dimensions of St. Joseph's school building are 40x50 feet. The building was
							erected by the Rev. A. B. Oechtering in 1863, at a cost of $2,000. Father Boccard put
							new desks in the school in 1903. Lay-teachers taught the school from 1861 to 1875. The
							Sisters of Providence from 1875 to June 1901. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Tipton
							since September 1901. The eight grades are taught, two Sisters teaching sixty-six

							was bought by Father Bleckmann in 1883 for $1,700; but this house being too far from
							the church and school, the Weber property was secured, April 13, 1889, for $3,000 and
							the old Sisters' house sold.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house was a one-story building of four rooms and stood on the lot,
							bought in 1863. The present priest's residence is a two-story brick building, with
							eight rooms, built by Rev. T. O'Sullivan, in 1869, for $2,385; Father Romer added a

						<p>The history of Klaasville goes back to 1856, when a number of German families settled
							here, who, from 1856 to 1860, attended the church at St. John, about eight miles from
							Klaasville. The first church was a common, frame building with very common seats,
							which cost about $500. It was built in 1860 to 1861, and was dedicated, by Bishop
							Luers, Father Nigh having charge at the time. At this time the congregation numbered
							about fourteen families, or sixty souls. In 1878, Father Bathe built an addition to
							the church and the steeple, at a cost of $700. The seating capacity of the church is
							about 200. The church grounds comprise five and one-half acres of ground, four of
							which were donated in 1860, by the Klaas brothers. The place is named after Henry
							Klaas.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house was erected in 1866, by Father Renson, and cost about $800.
							The present priest's house was bought by Father Bathe, in 1878, for $1,125, having one
							and a half acres of ground with it. This house was repaired in 1901, for $220. The
							first priest's house has been occupied by the teachers of the district school, for

							1860.</head>

						<p>Kokomo was named after an Indian chief, and signifies poplar, in the Indian tongue.
							The town was laid out, in 1844, and consisted of forty acres of land. We give here a
							list of the priests, who have served the Catholic people at Kokomo, as far back as
							1850. Other priests may have visited the place, or rather this region of country, but
							there is no record to that effect. The names are: Of those who visited Kokomo when a
							station, Rev. D. Maloney, Rev. William Doyle. Priests who visited Kokomo when a
							mission, from 1859 till September 1869, Rev. George Hamilton, Rev. B. J. Force, Rev.
							Bernard Kroeger, Rev. Michael Hanley, Rev. B. T. Borg, Rev. Simon Siegrist, Rev. C.
							Mougin, Rev. Lawrence Lamoor, Rev. J. Kelly. The resident pastors: Rev. Patrick
							Frawley, from September 1869 till October 1871; Rev. J. H. O'Brien, from October 1871
							till June 1872; Rev. John Grogan, from June 1872 to September 1873; Rev. Francis
							Lordemann, since September 1873.</p>

						<p>On January 24, 1859, two lots were secured and in the year following Father Hamilton
							erected the first church, a small, frame building but sufficient for the time. A
							sacristy was added to this building by Father Frawley. The congregation, at this time,
							comprised about forty families. In 1874, Father Lordemann built the parochial
							residence, still in use. <pb id="VAB8203-289" n="289"/> In 1875, he bought the lot
							north of his residence. The old church, having become entirely inadequate, was removed
							to an adjoining lot and, in its place, was erected a brick church, 56x115 feet, with a
							seating capacity of 700. It was dedicated by Bishop Dwenger, in 1877. Its cost was
							about $20,000. In 1900, two lots on Fremont street, were secured for $1,600. In 1903,
							the parochial residence was improved and enlarged, was equipped with a steam heating
							apparatus, and newly furnished throughout, at an expense of about $4,000.</p>

						<p>The first school was organized, in 1874, when part of the church was partitioned off,
							and used for school purposes, with an attendance of about thirty-five pupils. In 1877,
							the old church building was fitted up for school, accommodating 130 pupils. The
							attendance at this time was sixty. But, to accommodate the increasing number of
							children, a new school building was erected, in 1893, and was dedicated by Bishop
							Rademacher. It is a two-story brick building, 40x65 feet, costing about $11,000. The
							attendance had increased to 160. In October, 1904, an addition consisting of a
							Sisters' residence and a basement costing $3,500, was added to the school building,
							now known as St. Francis' Academy. The Sisters of St. Joseph have charge of the
							school, the usual eight grades and high school are taught. There is no debt on the
							church property at present. The church which has served its purpose so well, is found
							inadequate to accommodate the Catholic population of Kokomo. Father Lordemann has
							begun the erection of a new church, which will be 150 feet long, 64 feet wide in the
							nave, and 84 feet in the transept. A basement 12 feet high is under the entire
							building. It is to be of Bedford stone and of Gothic architecture. The height of the
							main tower is 175 feet, and that of the north tower 130 feet. When completed it will
							have cost $75,000.</p>

						<p>St. Patrick's Congregation has these societies: The Catholic Benevolent Legion, since
							1882; the Ancient Order of Hibernians; the Rosary Society, since 1862, which during
							its existence has furnished the church with a bell, two side altars, three statues,
							baptismal font, vestments, etc.; the Young Ladies' Sodality, since 1871, which
							furnished the main altar and many of its ornaments; the League of the Sacred Heart,
							since 1900; the Kokomo Zouaves, composed of boys of the congregation <pb

							the prize of a gold medal at a competitive drill at Elwood, on July 4, 1900; the
							Knights of Columbus, since 1902, with a membership of 125. Two boys of St. Patrick's
							are studying for the priesthood, and five girls have entered religious communities.
							The parish has 189 families, numbering 825 souls. Four Sisters of St. Joseph have

							acres of land, donated by P. Didion. The old log church is no more and-in its place
							stands now a stately brick church, 130x50 feet. It was built by Father Uphaus, at a
							cost of $18,000. The seating capacity is 600, and the style of architecture is Gothic.
							The steeple is 100 feet high. At the time the church was built, the congregation
							numbered sixty families.</p>

						<p>The school, built in 1880 by the same Father, at a cost of $500, is 24x24 feet, with
							accommodations for 100 pupils. Two Sisters of the Most Precious Blood teach the
							school, attended by sixty-six children. The parish church has no priest's house, the
							pastor residing at the mission house; nor has it a residence for the Sisters, the
							Sisters residing in their convent. The church property has a debt of $200. The number
							of souls at the present time is 350, consisting of seventy families. Five boys of the
							parish have become priests C. PP. S., and three girls have entered the convent.</p>

						<p>Holy Trinity has St. Joseph's Society, for married men, forty members; the Christian

							1862.</head>

						<p>The construction of the Wabash railroad and bridge across the river, in 1850 and
							1851, brought a number of Catholic families to Attica. Rev. Michael Clark and later,
							Rev. Edward O'Flaherty, attended them making their home with James Sheridan and
							celebrating Mass in private houses or public halls. At the time, there were about
							twenty-five Catholic families in and around Attica. Many members of the <pb
								id="VAB8203-292" n="292"/> congregation are descendants of the pioneers of those
							days. Powers' will bequeathed two lots and $600 for the erection of a church. These
							lots, located near the Wabash depot, were exchanged for one lot on Perry street, near
							Monroe. During Father O'Flaherty's absence to the old country, Rev. F. Joseph Stephan
							collected an additional $600 and erected a frame church, in 1862. At the suggestion of
							Bishop Luers, a second lot was bought for $300, on which stood a house used later for
							a priest's house.</p>

						<p>It was in 1863, that Attica received its first resident pastor, in the person of Rev.
							Joseph Rademacher, who also attended Covington and the entire country, east and west,
							from Odell to the Illinois State Line. He found the church and house devoid of every
							convenience. The pews in the church were rough boards and store boxes. He procured
							pews, an altar and a little reed organ. In 1865, he prepared a class and admitted them
							to their first Holy Communion, in May. On this occasion, Bishop Luers also
							administered Confirmation. The congregation was small, and poor, and Father Rademacher
							submitted without complaint, to many privations and hardships. In the year 1870, Rev.
							John Bleckmann succeeded Father Rademacher. He bought the cemetery grounds. The most
							necessary repairs and improvements on the priest's house were made by him. He also
							built an addition to the church, in which a Catholic school was taught for a while,
							but for a lack of funds had to be discontinued.</p>

						<p>Father Bleckmann was succeeded by Rev. Thomas Cahill, whose successor, in May 1875,
							was Rev. Dominic Meier, O. F. M. He resided at Lafayette, attending Attica from there,
							and receiving $300 per annum, and railroad fare, for his services. The Rev. John A.
							Mark was appointed pastor at Attica in April, 1876, and was succeeded by Rev. Henry M.
							Plaster in January, 1880. In that year Covington was made an independent congregation.
							Father Plaster preferring it to Attica, Rev. Charles Lemper was sent to Attica in
							August, of the same year. The first ten years of Father Lemper's pastorate, were
							productive of an iron fence around the cemetery, an addition to the priest's house and
							other necessary improvements. The building of a new church was determined on, in 1890.
							All the stone for the foundation were donated and the farmers <pb id="VAB8203-293"
								n="293"/> did the hauling. A member of the parish burnt the brick on his place, and
							boarded the laborers, whilst the congregation paid their wages, and the farmers again
							did the hauling of brick, sand and other material. The church was dedicated by Bishop
							Rademacher, of Nashville, on June 21, 1891.</p>

						<p>In 1895, Father Lemper built the present priest's house. In the same year Father
							Lemper arranged the addition to the old church for a dwelling for the Sisters, and
							having partitioned the old church into two school-rooms, he reopened the parochial
							school. On account of inadequate school accommodations, as well as accommodations for
							the Sisters, and the greatly reduced number of children attending, the school was
							abandoned, some seven or eight years later. When Father Lemper left the parish, there
							was a debt of $2,541.83. Father Lemper secured assistance from far and near, outside
							of the parish.</p>

						<p>Rev. A. Henneberger was appointed the pastor at Attica, in July 1898. He enjoyed poor
							health, but hoped to be benefitted by this change; the change, however, did not
							benefit him, on the contrary his health grew steadily worse. He was removed, and on
							May 5, 1899 the present pastor Rev. F. Von Schwedler took charge of the parish. At the
							present time there is no debt on the church property. The number of souls is steadily
							increasing and a larger church will have to be provided in the near future. The
							congregation has ninety-two families, numbering 394 souls. The parish has an Altar
							Society, for married women, with forty-seven members, an Altar Society, for single
							women, with twenty members and the Catholic Foresters.</p>

							1863.</head>

						<p>The Rev. Joseph Stephan, it would seem, was the first to visit the Catholics of
							Oxford and surroundings. He was at the time visiting many other places. He said Mass,
							at Oxford, in the Court house, public school house and in various private houses, and
							was in the habit of coming here from 1860 till 1863. Until 1867 Rev. E. B. Kilroy
							attended here. It was he who laid the foundation for the present church, in the year
								<pb id="VAB8203-294" n="294"/> 1863. There being no railroad transportation in those
							days, building material had to be hauled a long distance, and required much time. The
							church however was put under roof, Father Stephan still calling occasionally, and also
							Rev. C. J. O'Callaghan. The latter was the first resident pastor at Oxford. The
							baptismal records begin with July 1867. In 1870 Father O'Callaghan was succeeded by
							Rev. John R. Dinnen, during whose pastorate, the church was plastered, and some old
							pews and furniture obtained from Lafayette. The dimensions of the church are 76x36
							feet, with an elevation of 25 feet. The probable cost of the church was $6,000. The
							congregation, at that time, numbering about 175 souls, was larger than it is now. The
							church grounds consist of four acres of land. Father Dinnen remained until October,
							1875, and was succeeded by Rev. Meinrad McCarthy, O. S. B., after whom came Rev. John
							F. Lang from October 1877 till April 1882. Rev. P. J. Crosson was pastor until
							September 1894, Rev. Julius Becks until June 1895, when the Rev. William C. Miller was
							sent here and remained until October 6, 1906. The Rev. F. X. Labonte had charge from
							October 30, 1906 till March 21, 1907. It is related of Father McCarthy that on a
							Christmas day he celebrated the first Mass in St. Bridget's Church (Barrydale), rode
							his little pony to Fowler, where he said the second Mass, and then rode to Oxford to
							celebrate the third Mass. The church was repaired and refurnished by Father Miller,
							who put in new stained glass windows, in 1896, and repaired the whole building in
							1904, arching the ceiling, frescoing the interior, redecorating and painting the
							altars, pews etc., at a total cost of $3,500. The congregation has only twenty-eight
							families, or 113 souls, and has no debt on its church property.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house was a small cottage, built by Father Dinnen, for about $800.
							It was remodeled and refurnished at a cost of $1,350 by Father Miller. The Altar
							Society, with thirty members, takes care of the altar and sanctuary, and supplies its
							wants, such as candles, oil, linens, etc. One girl of the parish became a Sister of
							Providence.</p>

						<p>Oxford was supplied by the Rev. J. R. Dinnen from March 21, 1907, the date on which
							Father Labonte died, until June 8, 1907, when St. Patrick's Church again received a
							resident pastor, in the person of Rev. H. C. Kappel.</p>

						<p>The treaty of the United States with the Indians, in 1832, assigned as their reserve
							to the Pottawottamies, a region of country to the southwest of Plymouth, its
							northeastern corner being near the western border of the town. The Pottawottamies were
							Catholics, and a good sized chapel, built of logs, occupied a site on the north bank
							of one of the Twin Lakes. The building has long since disappeared. Prior to 1842, the
							early missionaries such as Fathers Allouez, Aveneau and other Jesuit Fathers, as well
							as Father Badin, visited these regions. From 1842, however, the Fathers, of the
							Congregation of the Holy Cross, attended to the spiritual wants of these Indians and
							the early Catholic settlers, in Marshall county. In 1838, Father Petit, at the earnest
							entreaty of the officers of United States military forces, conducted the Indians from
							their reservation to their new home, in the west.</p>

						<p>The history of the present St. Michael's Congregation dates back to 1856, when on
							December 19th, three lots were bought on which now stand the church, the priest's
							house and the school. The total cost of the three lots was $500. The first resident
							pastor was Rev. Gabriel Volkert, from 1862 to 1864. St. Michael's Church was built in
							1863, and was dedicated by Bishop Luers, in September of that year. Rev. George
							Steiner was pastor from 1864 to 1866. After him came Rev. Francis Siegelack, from 1866
							to 1869. He organized the St. Boniface's Benevolent Society. The Rev. George Zurwellen
							took charge of the parish, in October 1869, and remained till the time of his death,
							February 5, 1883. A school had been in operation since 1861, taught by lay-teachers.
							The building was a long building with a boarded partition, which separated the school
							from the stable. When Father Zurwellen began his work, the school and stable
							combination was removed to the back part of the lot, on which the pastoral residence
							stands today, and the priest's house was removed from the extreme south to its present
							location. A brick school-house, costing $12,000, known today as St. Michael's Academy,
							was erected in 1870. About this time a bell was bought.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-296" n="296"/>

						<p>On November 20, 1872, the three lots opposite the church were bought. These lots
							front to the north, and the present St. Joseph's Hall is situated on one of them, lot
							67. The first cemetery of St. Michael's Congregation was one acre of ground, donated
							by John Hughes, and was used until 1871; when the city of Plymouth gave the Catholics
							the privilege of using a portion of Oak Hill cemetery. This continued until April 15,
							1875, when Father Zurwellen secured the four acres of ground, which are used today for
							burials. The Rev. Louis A. Moench was the resident pastor, from February 6, 1883 until
							July 26, 1898. The debt of $5,000 was paid by him, the pastoral residence was built at
							a cost of $1,200, the church was frescoed for $660, beautiful new altars were
							provided, St. Joseph's Hall was built, at a cost of $1,300, stained glass windows were
							placed in the church, a new iron fence was built and sidewalks put down. The delivery
							from church debt was duly celebrated on February 18, 1890. Succeeding Father Moench
							the following were the pastors here: Rev. Charles Lemper, from 1898 till his death on
							December 13, 1900; Rev. Peter Schmitt, from July 1900, during the illness and after
							the death of Father Lemper, till March 1, 1901; Rev. Simon M. Yenn, from March 1, 1901
							till July 1, 1905; Rev. Henry C. Kappel, from July 1, till September 1, 1905; Rev.
							John Tremmel since September 1, 1905. Father Yenn made many necessary repairs and
							improvements on the entire church property, including the grounds. Three acres of the
							cemetery, consisting of six acres, also received much needed attention from Father
							Yenn. At the time of his removal the fund for a new church had accumulated the
							handsome amount of $9,000. During this time the Sisters of the Holy Cross enlarged
							their Academy, which serves also for parochial school, twice; it being now a
							commodious structure of three-stories and basement, running back from street to alley.
							Center street was improved during the pastorate of Father Tremmel. At the present time
							the fund for a new church amounts to $9,616.13.</p>

						<p>Plymouth has 114 Catholic families, numbering 518 souls. The parochial school, in
							connection with the academy, having an attendance of ninety-eight pupils, is conducted
							by four Sisters of the Holy Cross. The church societies are: The Rosary Society, with
							ninety-five members; the Sacred Heart <pb id="VAB8203-297" n="297"/> Sodality, with
							sixty-seven; and the Children of Mary, with thirty-four members. Other associations

							CONCEPTION.<lb/> 1864.</head>

						<p>When Ege was visited for the first time, in 1856, as a station, by Rev. Francis
							Deschamp, it was called Girardot Settlement. It was in 1853, that Gabriel Girardot
							emigrated from France and settled on a farm, where Ege is now located. When Father
							Deschamp visited the place, he found nine families in that neighborhood. The Rev.
							Henry Vincent Schaefer, pastor at Avilla, visited Ege as a station, and in 1863 the
							first church, 25x40 feet, was built. In July, of that year, Bishop Luers and Father
							Benoit celebrated Mass in the unfinished church-- they were at the time prospecting
							for a location, where to build the diocesan orphan asylum. Gabriel Girardot had
							preceded his family to this country and had made a vow that he would build a church if
							he would see his family in the New World. He donated two acres of land, where the
							cemetery now is, and there he constructed a church and made most of the furniture with
							his own hands. In consequence, the church was a long time building, and was not
							finished until May, 1864. When completed, the little frame church was valued at
							$1,000. After Father Schaefer, the pastors of Avilla had charge of Ege as a mission;
							namely: Rev. Francis Deipenbrock, 1863; Rev. John Wemhoff, from December 1863 till
							December 1865; Rev. A. B. Oechtering, from December 1865 till May 12, 1867; and Rev.
							Dominic Duehmig, from May 12, 1867 till 1876. During this time, the Fathers of the
							Holy Cross would frequently relieve the pastors of Avilla, by attending the mission
							Ege. In 1875, Father Duehmig purchased four acres of land, at a short distance from
							the church westward, where two roads cross and there put up a more spacious frame
							church, 35x90 feet, with a seating capacity of 260. The old church was moved to the
							new place and an addition was made to it; after which it served the various purposes
							of a school-house, <pb id="VAB8203-298" n="298"/> of a teacher's residence, and of a
							priest's house, until 1885. The Sisters of St. Francis, of Joliet, took charge of the
							school, in 1879.</p>

						<p>The Rev. William Geers was the first resident pastor of Ege, in 1876, and was
							succeeded by the Rev. Peter Franzen, from February 1877 until October 1878. After him
							came Rev. F. X. Ege, from October 1878 until November 1897. He found the church
							property indebted to the amount of $3,500. In 1885, the old church burned down,
							insured for $500. Father Ege thereafter erected a two-story brick building, 30x65
							feet, the lower front room accommodating sixty pupils, and the upper front room being
							used for parish meetings and entertainments, until January 1898, when it too was used
							for school purposes. The other parts of this building serve the Sisters for a
							residence of six rooms. In 1878, Father Ege erected a handsome two-story, ten room
							priest's house, at a cost of $3,000.</p>

						<p>The present pastor, Rev. Francis P. Faust, took charge of the parish in November,
							1897. He found that the parish had a debt of only $30~9 He has made various
							improvements and many repairs, with several purchases, amounting to fully $2,500, and
							there is a debt of $243 on the church property. The church grounds proper comprise
							four acres; and the two acres of the old church is now used for burial purposes. Two
							members of the parish have become Franciscan Brothers and five have become Sisters.
							The number of souls is 408, consisting of seventy-five families.</p>

						<p>St. Mary's Society, for married women, has forty members; St. Rose's, for single

						<p>The Rev. George A. Hamilton visited Kentland and vicinity, from 1861 to 1864, from
							Logansport. After him, it was attended from Rensselaer by Rev. Joseph A. Stephan,
							until 1870. He visited the place once a month, celebrating Mass in the Court House or
							in Kent's hotel, boarding with John H. Schmitt, a mile and three-quarters from
							Kentland. <pb id="VAB8203-299" n="299"/> The Catholics numbered about fifteen
							families, Irish, German and French, within a radius of twelve miles. In 1864 Father
							Stephan erected the-first church, a frame structure, 24x40 feet.</p>

						<p>The grounds, on which the church, priest's house, the school and the teachers' house
							stand, have a frontage of about 360 feet, with a depth of 150 feet. Opposite this
							ground the church owns two acres, just outside the corporation of Kentland. The
							cemetery has five acres, one mile south of the church. These grounds were secured
							during the pastorates of Revs. J. Stephan, A. Messmann, and W. C. Miller.</p>

						<p>The first resident pastor was the Rev. Anthony Messmann, from 1870 to 1881. He
							resided with the above mentioned John H. Schmitt until 1872, when the priest's house
							was built. He added 30 feet to the church, to gain more room. Rev. F. X. Baumgartner
							added a sacristy, 28x14 feet, built a tower and supplied it with a bell. Father
							Baumgartner was pastor from 1881 to March 1883. After him came Rev. William C. Miller,
							from .March 1883 to September 1891. Father Miller built the present church, in 1888.
							It is a brick building, 100x45 feet and 24 feet in height. It has stained glass
							windows of Roman style; the ceiling is flat. The Main Altar of the old church was
							transferred to the new church, and two neat side altars and two confessionals were
							provided. The cost of this church was $9,000. It has a seating capacity of 400.</p>

						<p>Rev. Charles A. Ganzer was pastor from September 1891 to December 10, 1902. He
							renovated the church and made necessary repairs, giving the church a new roof and
							purchasing a beautiful Main Altar. The church was also frescoed and electric lighting
							provided, another bell was procured, a new way of the Cross secured, a new pipe organ
							and a steam heating plant installed. The present pastor, Rev. Charles V. Stetter, D.
							D., holding that position since February 13, 1903, enriched the sanctuary for
							Christmas, 1905, with an artistic crib.</p>

						<p>Father Messmann started a school in 1872, but it had to be discontinued. The school
							was a frame building, 44x18 feet. In 1885, Father Miller reopened the school. It was
							taught by lay teachers till 1887, when the Sisters of St. Francis took charge. In
							1888, Father Miller remodeled the old church into a two-room school-house. The old
							school building and the sacristy of the old church were made into a residence for <pb
								id="VAB8203-300" n="300"/> the Sisters. Father Stetter built a porch to it. The
							dimensions of the school are 40x70 feet, accommodating ninety children. The eight
							grades are taught. Two Sisters have charge of ninety-five pupils at present.</p>

						<p>The priest's house, built in 1872 by Father Messmann, is a nine room two-story brick
							structure. It was Father Miller, who finished the entire house and furnished it more
							completely. Father Stetter also has done something in that direction. The church
							property has a debt of $2,119.98. The number of souls is 540, consisting of 106

						<p>The first priest on record at Wabash, is Rev. John Ryan, who residing at Lagro
							occasionally attended Wabash, from 1862 to September 1865. He celebrated Mass at the
							homes of Patrick Ivory and others. At this time the number of souls <pb
								id="VAB8203-301" n="301"/> was thirty-five, Irish and German. The foundation for the
							new church was put down, in 1864, by Father Ryan, and the building was begun by Rev.
							B. Kroeger, and completed during the pastorates of Rev. George Steiner, and Rev. M. E.
							Campion, the latter two residing at Lagro. The building cost about $2,000, and the
							number of souls at this time was about forty. A lot, donated by Patrick Dwyer 66x132,
							was given in trade for two lots making the grounds 132x132 feet. This business was
							transacted by Father Ryan. The church built in 1864 was a brick building, 30x60 feet,
							to which Rev. P. J. Crosson added sixteen feet, in 1898. The same had the interior
							decorated and put in electric lights, at a cost of $700. The seating capacity of this
							church was 250. A frame school-house, 20x30 feet costing $800, was built by Rev. F. C.
							Wiechmann in 1877, but the school had to be discontinued after the first year, for
							want of support. The first priest's house was located on the corner of Maple and
							Comstock streets, a half block west of the church; but in 1888, Rev. John H. Bathe
							built a new house on the corner of Minor and Fisher streets and adjacent to the
							church, at a cost of about $1,700; and in 1898, Rev. P. J. Crosson enlarged it, at an
							expenditure of about $500.</p>

						<p>The described church property was exchanged by Rev. Robert J. Pratt, for a church and
							house, owned by the Methodists, on the northeast corner of Sinclair and Cass streets.
							This church is a two-story brick building, the second story used for church purposes
							has a seating capacity of 500. The house, adjacent to this church, which is the
							present priest's residence, is a commodious two-story brick building. The Methodist
							people had expended fully $22,000 on these buildings. The church and house have a
							frontage of 96 feet on Sinclair street and 123 feet on Cass street. St. Bernard's
							Congregation secured this property, in exchange for their church and house, by paying
							a cash difference of $5,500. This business was transacted on April 17, 1900, and, on
							the same day, two lots 264x264 feet, with a large brick residence, just back of the
							church property were bought, with the intention of using it for school purposes at
							some future time. This last purchase cost the congregation $4,000 in cash, and the
							first priest's house on Comstock and Maple streets, valued at $1,500. The church was
							remodeled, and $3,500 was spent in doing this; <pb id="VAB8203-302" n="302"/> besides
							furnishing the church with altars, confessionals, sacred vessels and also putting in a
							heating system. The Very Rev. J. H. Guendling, Administrator of the diocese, dedicated

							1865.</head>

						<p>The Catholics of the northwestern part of Fort Wayne, anxious to improve their church
							accommodations, took steps to form a new congregation. A meeting representing the
							thirty-five families of this district was held, on November 15, 1863. Bishop Luers
							approved the intention of these Catholics to build a church, and gave his consent to
							the purchase of a building site. A number of other meetings were held to accomplish
							the end in view. Some opposition, however, was experienced on the part of Rev. Joseph
							Weutz, then pastor of St. Mary's Church. Bishop Luers explained later, that the
							opposition arose from a misunderstanding. Finally, on February 2, 1865, property was
							bought on the southeast corner of Griffith street (now Fairfield avenue) and
							Washington boulevard, at a <pb id="VAB8203-303" n="303"/> cost of $3,500 from George
							W. Ewing; ten years' time was given to pay the price. A frame church, 75 feet long and
							37 feet wide, was erected at a cost of $3,700. A unique method of securing funds was
							resorted to, by renting the pews of the church not yet built. The church was
							dedicated, by Bishop Luers, on the first Sunday in October, 1865. On December 16,
							1865, Bishop Luers gave St. Paul's Church their first pastor, in the person of Rev.
							Edward Koenig; the Bishop himself introducing Father Koenig to the congregation.</p>

						<p>Father Koenig at once organized a School Society and an Altar Society. The Bishop
							fixed the 25th of January of each year, the Feast of .the Conversion of St. Paul, as
							the patron feast of the Church. Already on January 19, 1866, the zealous pastor opened
							the parochial school, with Louis Weiser as the first teacher and an attendance of
							sixty-eight children.</p>

						<p>Two additional lots were bought on January 28, 1866, for $5,000. During Lent, of the
							same year, the Rosary Society was established, and on March 25th, the Confraternity of
							the Scapular of Mount Carmel. Still another lot was bought in July 1866 for $1,400.
							Louis Weiser, the first teacher, went to the seminary and Peter Mettler succeeded him
							as teacher. In September 1867, the boys and girls began to be taught in separate
							school-rooms: Clementine Koenig, sister of Father Koenig, teaching the girls. The
							frame school building having become entirely inadequate, a brick school-house was
							erected at a cost of $3,308, and in September 1868 the same was ready for occupancy.
							The same building is used for school purposes at the present time. When in 1868,
							Franciscan Fathers gave a Mission, the Young Men's Sodality, under the patronage of
							St. Anthony of Padua, and the Young Ladies' Sodality, under that of St. Agnes, were
							established on September 21st.</p>

						<p>The church property is made up of 92x150 feet on the southeast corner, and of
							1271x150 feet, on the northeast corner of Washington boulevard and Fairfield avenue;
							and of 48x150 feet on Washington boulevard; the latter was bought in 1903 and is now
							used as the priest's house. The cost of the residence and property was $11,500. The
							first property was bought before a priest had charge, Father Koenig bought the second,
							and the present pastor the last mentioned.</p>

						<p>The present church was erected by Father Koenig in 1886, <pb id="VAB8203-304" n="304"
							/> at a cost of about $55,000. It was built in the Roman style of architecture. The
							furniture is all solid oak. The seating capacity is about 600. On January 22, 1898,
							Father Koenig, after thirty-three years of arduous pastoral work, was called to his
							reward.</p>

						<p>Bishop Rademacher appointed Rev. H. F. Joseph Kroll, to succeed Father Koenig, on
							February 21, 1898. The new pastor found a debt of $17,000 on the church property. A
							number of improvements had become necessary, which received immediate attention by
							Father Kroll. It was he who bought the present priest's house for $11,500 and
							converted the former pastoral residence on Fairfield avenue into a school; this
							residence had been erected by Father Koenig in 1881 at a cost of $6,586. The school
							can accommodate about 150 children. At the present time four Poor Handmaids of Jesus
							Christ have charge of the school. The school is well graded, eight grades being
							taught. The school is supported by St. Paul's School Society. At present 101 children
							are in attendance at school.</p>

						<p>Three boys of the parish have become priests and one boy is now at his studies. Nine
							girls have become Sisters.</p>

						<p>The parish has 148 families and the total number of souls is 675. The societies are:
							The School Society, 110 members; the Altar and Rosary Society, for married women, 110
							members; St. Anthony's Sodality, for single men, thirty-five members; St. Agnes'
							Sodality, for single women, sixty-five members; the Boys' Sodality, thirty-four
							members; the Girls' Sodality, forty-two members; the Purgatorian Society, fifty
							members; the Scapular Confraternity, 150 members; the Sacred Heart League, 250
							members, and the St. Joseph's Benevolent League, with sixty-one members.</p>

							till 1891; Rev. John Tremmel, from August 1891 till September 1, 1905; Rev. Peter
							Schmitt, since September 13, 1905.</p>

						<p>Father O'Flaherty attended Covington from Crawfordsville. The number of souls in 1859
							was about 350, or sixty families, of Irish nationality. Father Stephan laid the
							foundation of the church in 1860, and Father Rademacher completed it in 1865. Bishop
							Luers dedicated the building in October, 1867. The dimensions of this church were
							30x60 feet, and the cost was $6,000. The church grounds consist of two lots and ten
							feet, donated by a Mr. Daly, during Father O'Flaherty's time. The church is a brick
							structure, but in 1875 a frame addition was made to the rear of it, during Father
							Bleckmann's pastorate. For a short time this addition was used for a school; the cost
							of it was about $650. The priest's house was built by Father Plaster, at a cost of
							about $2,400. The debt on the church property at the present time is $300. The
							mission, Veedersburg, is attended from Covington on two Sundays of the month.</p>

						<p>At the present time the number of families is fifty-one. The Rosary Society has
							fifty-three members. The men of the parish belong to Catholic Knights of America,

							1865,</head>

						<p>This church, in its earliest days, was called St. Charles', later St. Joachim's, and
							since 1901 St. Joseph's Church. It was attended as a station, as early as 1862, when
							priests visited here from Lafayette, such as Rev. E. B. Kilroy and others. The
							Catholic population, at that time, was about sixty-five <pb id="VAB8203-306" n="306"/>
							souls. The first church was a building formerly used as a residence and then remodeled
							for a church, in about 1865, by Rev. Joseph A. Winter who continued to attend till
							1870. Rev. John R. Dinnen visited the place, from 1871 till 1874. The following were
							the resident pastors of Lebanon: Rev. Thomas M. Cahill, from the beginning of 1874
							till May 1875; Rev. John Ryan, from May 1875 till December 1878; Rev. L. A. Moench,
							from 1879 till 1882; Rev. John Dempsey, from 1882 till September 1884; Rev. D. J.
							Mulcahy, from 1884 till the fall of 1886; Rev. Michael F. Kelly, from the fall of 1886
							till 1893; Rev. H. A. Hellhake, from 1893 till August 1898; Rev. W. S. Hogan, from
							August 1898 till 1899; Rev. P. J. Crawley, from June 1899 till July 1905; Rev. James
							Connelly, since July 1, 1905.</p>

						<p>The first building used for church, bought by Father Winters, was located within a
							half square of the Court House. At that time the population was from eighty to ninety
							souls. Father Ryan was the pastor, in 1876, when the present church grounds were
							secured. He sold the old place, and Father Crawley, by another sale, reduced the
							church grounds to their present dimensions. The second church was a building formerly
							occupied by the Christian denomination. It could seat 200 persons, and was bought by
							Father Winters for $300. This continued to be used for the church until 1901, when the
							present church was erected by Father Crawley. Its furnishings are complete in every
							detail. The seating capacity is about 450, and it cost $10,000.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house was a story-and-a-half building, bought by Father Dinnen for
							$200. It was sold with the first church property. Father Ryan purchased a house for
							$300, which Father Crawley repaired and improved at a cost of $1,500; this being the
							present priest's house. The church property has a debt of $2,000 on it. The number of
							souls at present is 209, or fifty-one families. Two girls of the parish have entered
							the convent.</p>

						<p>St. Joseph's has Altar and Rosary Societies, organized 1894. They have the care of
							the altar and the sanctuary; the Ancient Order of Hibernians, organized in 1896; also
							a Sodality for boys and girls. The altar of the church was donated by the Altar and
							Rosary Societies.</p>

						<p>Early missionaries paid occasional visits to Arcola and vicinity; but, in the year
							1866, Rev. P. J. Madden held regular services in an old school-house. The building of
							a church was inaugurated by him. The Rev. Henry Schaefer next attended Arcola from
							Columbia City. The Rev. Theodore Van der Poel was Arcola's first resident priest,
							arriving on Christmas eve and celebrating Mass, as pastor of Arcola, on Christmas day
							1867. The frame church, begun in 1866 by Father Madden, was a neat frame structure and
							completed by Father Van der Poel,' who also built the present priest's house. The Rev.
							Theodore Wilken came next to Arcola and built a fence around the church property. Rev.
							Bartholomew Hartmann succeeded Father Wilken in 18'80. During his stay of seven years
							the school-house was built. The congregation at this time, numbered about seventy
							families. Rev. Father Hickmann came next but only remained five or six weeks. Next
							came Rev. J. H. Werdein, continuing his pastorate for about four years; then Rev.
							William J. Quinlan was the pastor for two years, till August 20, 1891; and after him
							Rev. William Conrad Miller, who remained for a period of four years, till 1895.</p>

						<p>The pastorate of Rev. Robert Pratt at Arcola began June 29, 1895. It was he who
							induced the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ to take charge of the parochial school. It
							was during his pastorate also that a new brick church was built in 1898. He also
							erected the Sisters' residence. Upon Father Pratt's transfer to Wabash, January 30,
							1900, the Rev. S. M. Yenn succeeded him as pastor of St. Patrick's Church, continuing
							in that capacity for thirteen months. In March, 1901, the Rev. Peter Schmitt was
							appointed and remained until September 13, 1905, when he was succeeded by Rev. Henry
							C. Kappel. The present pastor is Rev. E. J. Mungovan, since June 8, 1907.</p>

						<p>St. Patrick's Parish has thirty-four families, numbering 180 souls. The school is

							1866.</head>

						<p>The country about Reynolds, less probably than a century ago, was noted principally
							for its low lands covered with water, sandy ridges appearing here and there, with
							scant vegetation. But in the year 1856 the water had receded sufficiently, for a dozen
							families or more, mostly Irish, to settle in this part of the country. It was in this
							year that Rev. Joseph Stephan, residing at San Pierre, began to visit the Reynolds
							settlement, and celebrate Mass in the home of Michael Vogel.</p>

						<p>The first church was erected from 1866 to 1867, at a cost of about $975. The Rev. J.
							A. Winter, assistant priest at St. Mary's Church, Lafayette, was in charge of
							Reynolds, at the time the church was building. The ground on which it stands,
							comprising seven and one half acres, was acquired in the year 1866. The seating
							capacity of this church was about 150. Without much adornment it served its purpose
							until 1876, when the second and present church was erected for about $6,000 or $7,000,
							under the direction of Rev. Dominic Meier, O. F. M., who attended Reynolds from
							Lafayette. The church is built in the Roman, style of architecture, and is a plain,
							brick building, 64x96 feet, with a seating capacity of 475.</p>

						<p>Several years after the church had been built, a frame school-house, 20x40 feet, was
							erected at a cost of about $475. The Sisters of St. Francis were in charge, residing
							in a small frame house built by Rev. John McMahon, opposite the school-house, in 1869.
							The school, however, after a number of years was abandoned, and the Sisters left the
							place. Father McMahon moved in the house, vacated by them, but lived in it only a <pb
								id="VAB8203-309" n="309"/> few days, when he departed this life on May 8, 1872.
							After this until 1899, the pastors of Reynolds occupied the old church for their
							residence.</p>

						<p>Rev. John Kubacki, in the year 1899, built the first and present pastoral residence,
							costing about $2,000. The church property is free from all indebtedness. St. Joseph's
							Church has the Rosary Society, a Young Ladies' Sodality, St. Joseph's Aid Society and
							the Poor Souls' Confraternity, since 1905. The number of souls in the parish is 282,
							or fifty-one families. One of the girls of this parish has become a Sister of St.
							Francis.</p>

						<p>The list of priests, having charge of St. Joseph's Church at Reynolds, is the

							1888.</p>

						<p>Prior to 1867, the Catholics of Dyer and vicinity were visited by Father Wehrle of
							Turkey Creek; they were considered members of St. John's Congregation, at St. John.
							The first church was a frame building, erected in 1867, by Father Schmitz, the first
							resident pastor of Dyer. The church cost from $4,000 to $5,000. The church grounds
							comprise about four acres of land. In 1893, Father Flach improved the church by
							replastering, frescoing, painting the building and putting in stained glass windows,
							and in 1899, giving the church a basement, with a chapel, all of which was done at a
							cost of $2,500. The church, with its new altars and a pipe organ, was now in very good
							condition; but on December 28, 1902, the entire church and contents were destroyed by
							fire. Father Flach, however, went to work and, on July 12, 1903, the corner-stone of a
							new church was laid by Bishop Alerding. The present church is a brick and cut stone
							Gothic structure, 118x432 feet, with a tower 125 feet high. The dedication took place
							on November 26, 1903, the Rev. J. H. Bathe, officiating. The entire cost of the church

						<p>The parochial school was opened in September 1901. The building of which has been

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">KENDALLVILLE.</hi><lb/> CHURCH OF THE IMMACULATE
							CONCEPTION.<lb/> 1867.</head>

						<p>Although no specific date can be given, it seems to be the opinion, that Rev. Stephen
							Badin, Rev. Simon Lalumiere, and Rev. Alphonse Munschina, visited Kendallville several
							years before the establishment of the diocese of Fort Wayne. Rev. Louis Mueller,
							residing at Fort Wayne, visited Kendallville a few times. After him Rev. Julian Benoit
							came more frequently. As a rule, however, the Catholics of these regions attended
							divine services at Avilla, prior to 1865.</p>

						<p>In the year mentioned, Rev. A. B. Oechtering, residing at Avilla, began to visit
							Kendallville regularly, celebrating Mass in the house of Peter Ringle. Owing to the
							construction of the Grand Rapids and Indiana railroad, the number of Catholics
							increased, so as to make the building of a church possible. Lots were bought in what
							is now known as the West Side, and in the fall of 1866, Bishop Luers laid the
							corner-stone of the new church. The erection of this church, however, was abandoned
							when Father Oechtering bought the Baptist church, which was offered him for $2,200.
							This building stood on the corner of Oak and Diamond streets. In 1867, Father
							Oechtering was transferred to Mishawaka, and Rev. Dominic Duehmig was made his
							successor at Avilla, having charge also of Kendallville. Father Duehmig remodeled the
							Baptist church, the Ladies' Altar Society assisting him in the purchase of the
							requisites for the altar and the sanctuary. Two rooms were added to the rear of the
							church, for the accommodation of the pastor, when visiting Kendallville. The full
							dimensions of the church, as it now stands, is 40x70 feet.</p>

						<p>Father Duehmig had charge up to 1884, and after him Rev. Max Benzinger, residing at
							Summit, until 1887. From <pb id="VAB8203-312" n="312"/> 1887 to 1889 Rev. John Hoss
							visited Kendallville. After that date until 1897, it again became a mission attended
							from Avilla. In 1897 Rev. George Lauer was made pastor of Ligonier, with Kendallville
							for a mission; when, however, Rev. John F. Noll was appointed to succeed Father Lauer
							in 1899, he took up his residence in Kendallville, and since that time Kendallville
							has had a resident pastor. Father Noll improved the church property and during his
							stay lived in a rented house. His successor, on June 8, 1902, was Rev. John C. Keller.
							That same year a residence was built, containing ten rooms, costing $2,500. On
							September 18, 1905, a church bell was bought. The church property has a debt of
							$1,450.</p>

						<p>The Kendallville Parish has the Altar Society, since 1868, and the Young Ladies'
							Sodality, since 1903, both for the women. The Holy Name Society is for the men. The
							number of souls is about 201, constituting forty-eight families.</p>

						<p>Priests attending Kendallville, for whom we can give any definite dates, were: Rev.
							August B. Oechtering, from 1865 till 1867; Rev. Dominic Duehmig, 1867 till 1884; Rev.
							Max. Benzinger, from Summit, 1884 till 1887; Rev. John Hoss, 1887 till 1889; Rev.

						<p>The spiritual needs of Catholics at Winamac and the surrounding country, were looked

							1870, and <pb id="VAB8203-313" n="313"/> again from December 1872 to 1873. In 1873,
							Bishop Dwenger gave the Fathers of the Congregation of the Most Precious Blood charge

							first of these Fathers sent to Winamac, but he remained only a few months when he was
							recalled, and Rev. Theopistus Wittmer, C. PP. S., was sent to fill his place. Father
							Wittmer built a parochial school and engaged the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood to

							1868.</head>

						<p>From about 1861 till 1865, the Rev. M. P. Wehrle, resident pastor at Lottaville
							(Turkey Creek), paid occasional visits to Crown Point. He celebrated Mass at the homes
							of Anna Shehan and Catharine Scherer, and also in the Court House. In fact the first
							pastoral residence served also as the first church. The resident pastors at Crown
							Point were: Rev. M. P. Wehrle, from December 31, 1865, till November 26, 1868; Rev.
							Louis Weiser, from November 26, 1868 till January 22, 1871; Rev. Henry Meissner, from
							January 22, 1871 till October 3, 1875; Rev. Matthias Zumbuelte, from October 3, 1875
							till April 17, 1876; Rev. Aegidius Hennemann, O. S. B., from April 17, 1876 till
							October 20, 1878; the name of Rev. Piriminius Levermann, O. S. B., also appears on the
							baptismal register from February 11, 1878 till May 5th, of the same year; Rev. John
							Ritter, from October 20th, till November 17, 1878; Rev. Aemilian Wendel, O. S. B.,
							from November 17, 1878 till July 23, 1882; Rev. Maurice Kaeder, O. S. B., from July
							23, 1882 till September 30, 1888; Father Wendel again, from September 30, 1888 till
							July 1, 1889; Rev. Philip Guethoff, since July 1, <pb id="VAB8203-315" n="315"/> 1889.
							The records of the church show 1,054 baptisms and 186 marriages, up to the present
							time. The church grounds consisting of about three acres cost $1,000, and were donated
							by Peter Kahoe in 1866.</p>

						<p>The first church building was a frame structure, 30x60 feet. It was erected at a cost
							of $1,500 and was dedicated by Bishop Luers on Rosary Sunday in 1868. The present
							pastoral residence was built in 1871 at a cost of $1,500, by Father Meissner. Later a
							.kitchen was added at an expenditure of $350. The present Sisters' residence was the
							first school-house; a one-story, one room frame structure built in 1872, at a cost of
							$1,000. The first church building, to which one story was added at a cost of over
							$1,000, by Father Guethoff, is the present school. It contains two school-rooms on the
							first floor and two on the second. Three of these rooms are used for school purposes,
							the other for society meetings. The Sisters of St. Agnes have charge of the school,
							which is attended by 103 pupils.</p>

						<p>Father Guethoff built the present church in 1890. It is of brick and stone, 50x113
							feet, and cost $12,800. The spire has a height of 142 feet; the architecture is
							Romanesque. The stained glass windows, the three altars, the pews, the pulpit, the
							organ, etc., necessitated an outlay of $5,000. The chapel in the basement, for Mass in
							winter, cost $600. $400 was paid for statuary. The frescoing of the church together
							with improvements and repairs in 1907 cost $3,000. The seating capacity of the church
							is 600. Crown Point has a Catholic population of 630, or 124 families. There is no
							debt on the church property.</p>

						<p>St. Joseph's Rosary Society, for married men, has twenty-three members. St. Mary's
							Rosary Society, for married women, eighty-five. St. Joseph's Sodality, for single men,
							has fifty-seven. St. Mary's Sodality, for single women, has eighty. The Infant Jesus
							Society, for children, has eighty-five. The League of the Sacred Heart, has 350
							members.</p>

						<p>One arce and a half was bought for cemetery purposes on March 13, 1869, for $140. In
							1907, Father Guethoff bought three and three-quarter acres, additional, for $675. Much
							has been done towards beautifying the cemetery, and a fund is being secured for its
							permanent care.</p>

							1868.</head>

						<p>The first visit of a priest to Elkhart was that of Rev. Henry Koenig, pastor at
							Mishawaka. From May 19, 1867, Rev. August B. Oechtering, also resident at Mishawaka,
							attended Elkhart as a station, celebrating Mass in private houses. The first church
							was erected under the supervision of Father Oechtering, in 1868. It was a brick
							building, 28x56 feet, and cost about $2,500. The number of souls at this time was
							about 100, Irish and German. The church grounds were secured, partly in 1867 and
							partly in 1885; Father Oechtering secured the old, and Rev. William Kroeger the new
							grounds, at a total cost of $2,100. The present church was erected in 1886, Father
							William Kroeger being pastor at the time. It is the Grecian style of architecture, and
							its dimensions are 130x60 feet. The cost of the building, including decorations and
							furniture, was $45,000.</p>

						<p>School is taught in the old church and a one-story building. The Sisters of the Holy
							Cross have charge of it, and the usual eight grades are being taught. The Sisters
							reside in the old parochial residence, erected in 1872, for $2,000, during the
							pastorate of Rev. Jeremiah Quinlan. This house was improved by the Rev. Henry
							Boeckelmann, in 1902. The priest's house, a two-story brick house, was erected in 1899
							by Father Boeckelmann, at a cost of $10,000. The church property has no debt on it,
							the balance of indebtedness having been paid off, on July 22, 1906.</p>

						<p>St. Vincent's Parish has the following societies: The Knights of Columbus, ninety
							members; the Catholic Benevolent Legion; Catholic Lady Foresters; Archconfraternity of
							the Rosary, 118 members; Young Ladies' Sodality, fifty-two members; the Guardian
							Angels' Society. The number of souls of the parish is 550. Two boys of the parish have
							become priests and two girls Sisters.</p>

						<p>The priests, who have had charge of Elkhart, either visiting it or residing there,
							were: Rev. August B. Oechtering, from 1868 till 1871; Rev. John H. Oechtering,
							assistant during <pb id="VAB8203-317" n="317"/> this time at Mishawaka, also visited
							Elkhart; Rev. Jeremiah Quinlan, from 1871 till 1875; Rev. Martin F. Noll, from 1875
							until 1880; Rev. William Kroeger from 1880 till 1891; Rev. Henry A. Boeckelmann from
							December 1891 till October 4, 1906; Rev. Francis J. Jansen, since November 1, 1906.
							The assistant priests at Elkhart have been, Rev. John F. Noll, from June till December
							1898; Rev. Charles F. Keyser, from October 11, 1902 till October 1903; Rev. F. X.
							Labonte from April 7, 1905 till October 30, 1906.</p>

						<p>The cemetery of St. Vincent's Parish is located a mile and one-half from the church,
							and comprises five and seven-eighths acres of land.</p>

						<p>The school, with an attendance of 142 pupils, is conducted by three Sisters of the
							Holy Cross, teaching the regular eight grades.</p>

						<p>The first Catholic families came to Marion with the construction of, what is now, the
							Michigan division of the Big Four railroad, in 1855. At that time for a number of
							years the pastors of Peru, Wabash, Kokomo and Union City visited here. The list of
							pastors, from 1868, is the following: Rev. B. T. Borg, assistant at Peru, from 1868
							till 1870; Rev. P. Frawley, first resident pastor, from 1875 till 1876; Rev. M. F.
							Kelly, from 1876 till 1882; Rev. James A. Twigg, from May 1882 till 1883; Rev. A. J.
							Strueder, from 1883 till September 1884; Rev. M. Joy, one month; Rev. John Grogan,
							from October 1884 till January 1894; Rev. W. J. Quinlan, from January 4, 1894 till
							April 14, 1906; Rev. P. J. Crawley, since April 14, 1906. Father Borg, in 1868, built
							the original portion of the old frame church, in which he said Mass for the first
							time, on the second Sunday of July, 1868. The first resident pastor was Rev. P.
							Frawley, who built the priest's house, which, in the summer and fall of 1897, was
							enlarged and refurnished, by Father Quinlan, at a cost of over $4,000.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-318" n="318"/>

						<p>The discovery of natural gas much increased the Catholic population of Marion; and
							when Father Quinlan took charge of the parish, in 1894, he at once enlarged the old
							frame church, which was ready for occupancy on March 4th, of that year. However, it
							was apparent that the building of a larger and more commodious church was a crying
							necessity. Ground was broke, for the present St. Paul's Church, on September 30, 1895;
							the corner-stone of it was laid on May 7, 1896, and, on November 7, 1897, the new
							church was solemnly dedicated, by Bishop Rademacher, in the presence of a vast
							concourse of people.</p>

						<p>St. Paul's Congregation has about 150 families, numbering 650 souls. The debt on the
							church property is $14,500. The societies of the parish have an aggregate membership
							of 219. Besides these, there are the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic Foresters, the
							C. L. B. A., the A. O. H., and the C. M. B. A.</p>

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">MONROEVILLE.</hi><lb/> ST. ROSE OF LIMA'S CHURCH.<lb/>
							1868.</head>

						<p>Tradition has it, that in the year 1831, the often mentioned missionary, Father
							Badin, came to Monroeville, on a sick call, to attend a certain French prospector,
							located there temporarily. It is certain, however, that Father Benoit administered to
							the Catholic people here, about 1840, celebrating Mass in the homes of Jerome Jeffroy
							and others. Father Bessonies too called here, about that time. Up to 1868, Monroeville
							was a station attended by priests residing at the Cathedral, in Fort Wayne. The
							Catholics hereabout numbered some twenty families, being French, Irish and German, as
							to nationality.</p>

						<p>From 1868 till 1884, Monroeville was a mission regularly visited in the order given,
							by Rev. E. P. Walters, Rev. J. H. Brammer, Rev. J. M. Graham, Rev. A. M. Meili, Rev.
							A. Heitmann, and Rev. T. Hibbelen. In the year 1884, when the place was being attended
							from Arcola by Rev. H. T. Wilken, <pb id="VAB8203-319" n="319"/> and Rev. B. Hartmann,
							Monroeville received its first resident pastor, in the person of Rev. John Grogan.
							Rev. John Hoss was resident pastor, from 1886 to 1887.</p>

						<p>The five lots owned by the church were bought, partly by Father Walters in 1868, and
							by Father Hartmann in 1886. The cemetery, consisting of four acres adjacent to the
							town, was bought by Father Wilken, in 1877. The total cost of this real estate was
							about $1,500. When these purchases were made, Father Walters resided at Fort Wayne and
							Fathers Hartmann and Wilken at Arcola.</p>

						<p>The first church, which was erected in 1868, was a small frame structure, and was
							destroyed by fire in 1887. The present church was built in 1888. The architecture is
							Gothic, the dimensions 32x92 feet and the spire 102 feet in height. It is a small, but
							beautiful church, and is a monument to the boundless zeal and untiring energy of the
							saintly Father Hartmann. The seating capacity is 300. In 1904, under the pastorate of
							the Rev. T. M. Conroy, a steam heating plant was provided, the church was being
							lighted by electricity, which, with a few other improvements, cost $2,300, and in 1907
							three new altars with carpet for the sancturay were provided; all of which was paid
							for, immediately after their installation. The parish has no school, for obvious
							reasons, but the children are being taught their catechism four times a week, and
							church history once a week.</p>

						<p>The pastoral residence was erected in 1882 by Father Hartmann, and was improved in
							1899 by Father Paquet. Owing to the purchase of additional real estate, recently made,
							there is at present a debt of $1,760 on the church property. The parish has the St.
							Joseph's Benevolent Society, since 1888; among other good works, it buries the poor
							dead of the parish. The Rosary Society has thirty members. The St. Aloysius' Society,
							for the young men, and the Blessed Virgin's Sodality, for the young women. The
							Columbus Club, for young men, has twenty-two members.</p>

						<p>In 1892 Father Hartmann was succeeded by Rev, F. Von Schwedler, whose successor was
							Rev. L. R. Paquet, in 1897. After him came Rev. F. J. Dandurand, from August 23, 1900
							until July 1904. The present pastor, Rev. T. M. Conroy, has had charge since September
							21, 1904.</p>

							1869.</head>

						<p>St. Joseph's Church is a branch of St. Vincent's Church. The first St. Joseph's
							Church was erected by Rev. Jacob Mayer, in 1869. It was a brick building, 80x40 feet,
							with a seating capacity of 600. At the time, the parish consisted of only fifty
							families. The cost of the church was only $4,300, because the parishoners did much of
							the work gratis. The dedication took place on February 2, 1870.</p>

						<p>In August 1872, the Rev. Henry Koehne took charge of St. Joseph's Congregation. In
							May 1882, he had paid off a debt of $6,000, and had accummulated a fund of $2,000 for
							a new church. The corner-stone of the new church was laid in July 1885, in December
							the building was under roof, and, on Sunday, October 23, 1887, the church was
							dedicated by Bishop Dwenger, assisted by Bishop Rademacher, of Nashville. The new and
							present church is 165 feet long and 65 feet wide. The elevation of the spire is 161
							feet, surmounted by a cross, 12 feet high. The style of architecture is Romanesque.
							Above the entrance is a gallery capable of seating 200 children, and immediately over
							this, is a smaller gallery for the organ and choir. The width of the center aisle is
							six feet, and of the two side aisles five feet. The furniture of the church is all
							black and white walnut, beautifully oiled. The church will seat 1,000 persons, leaving
							a vacant space for pews to accommodate 200 more. The fresco painting of the church is
							chaste, artistic and suggestive. The ten stained glass windows present scenes from the
							life of our Saviour, the Blessed Virign and the Saints. The total cost of the building
							amounts to $80,000.</p>

						<p>During the absence of Father Koehne in Europe, in 1888, three large bells were placed
							in the tower, at a cost of $1,250. In 1894, the church was again frescoed, and the
							artist, Zukotinski, executed four handsome oil paintings; the Archangel Michael over
							the Main Altar and the Archangel Gabriel, the Holy Family and the death of St. Joseph
							over the Side Altars. These paintings cost $500 each.</p>

						<p>New altars, in the byzantine style, were placed in 1894. They are in imitation of
							white marble, richly ornamented with <pb id="VAB8203-321" n="321"/> gold. The Main
							Altar has the statues of St. Joseph, St. Aloysius and St. Theresa; one Side Altar the
							statues of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and two angels, the other Side Altar the statues
							of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, St. Cecilia and St. Barbara. The cost was $3,000. A
							little later, fine oil paintings of the fourteen stations of the Cross were procured,
							for $1,400. Christmas of 1900 was distinguished with a new imported crib, worth $400.
							All the furniture and furnishings, and all needed articles for the sanctuary,
							including sacred vessels and vestments, have been procured and are in every respect
							first class.</p>

						<p>From the time Father Koehne took charge of the parish, the Cullen House was used as a
							school, from 1872 to 1892. The number of pupils increased to such an extent, that
							larger accommodations became a necessity. On the first day of April, 1891, the old
							church was torn down, and in its place a new school erected, and dedicated on January
							17, 1892. This building is in every respect commendable. It is three-stories in
							height, with a basement. The first floor has two classrooms, with a capacity each of
							seventy-five, on the same floor is a room for society meetings. The second floor has
							four class-rooms and two music rooms. The third floor is a hall, a perfect model of
							its kind, with a seating capacity of 600. The dimensions of the stage are 26x20 feet.
							The school was conducted by lay-teachers from 1872 to 1877. In August of 1877, Father
							Koenhe secured the School Sisters of Notre Dame for his schools. At the present time
							eight Sisters have charge of 290 children. The old school building has been remodeled
							and serves now as the Sisters' dwelling.</p>

						<p>Father Koehne, up to the time of his death, occupied the residence on the corner of
							Market and Second streets. In 1904 he purchased a residence adjacent to, and west of
							the church, for a priest's residence, at a cost of $9,000, from his own personal
							means, and donated the same to St. Joseph's Church. The debt on the church property is
							$2,555.</p>

						<p>The following are the societies: The Rosary Society, since 1869, with 100 members;
							St. Aloysius Young Men's Society, since 1883, with ninety members; the Young Ladies'
							Sodality of the Immaculate Conception, since 1872, with 140 members; the Sacred Heart
							Sodality, since 1899, with 125 members; the St. Joseph's Benevolent Society, since
							1872, <pb id="VAB8203-322" n="322"/> with 160 members. The number of families is 250,
							numbering about 1,150 souls. Two boys have become priests and eight girls Sisters.</p>

						<p>The pastors of St. Joseph's were: Rev. Jacob Mayer, from 1869 to 1872; Rev. Bernard
							Wiedau, Rev. F. Von Schwedler, and Rev. A. M. Meili, had charge temporarily. Rev.
							Henry Koehne, from August 1872 to November 24, 1906; Rev. Anthony J. H. Kroeger, since
							January 1, 1907.</p>

						<p>From 1903 to 1905, Fathers of the Most Precious Blood were assistants at St. Joseph's
							Church, but since May 1905 it was Rev. William Hoff, till July 13, 1907, when Rev.
							Henry Hoerstman was appointed.</p>

							1869.</head>

						<p>Muncie, the county seat of Delaware county, is situated on the south bank of the
							White river, about fifty-three miles northeast of Indianapolis. It is opposite the
							site of the old Indian town which was north of the White river, deriving its name from
							a tribe of Indians, known as the Muncies, who were a division of the Delaware tribe.
							It was here the Shawnee Prophet, Tecumseh's brother, resided.</p>

						<p>Missionaries, in the earliest days, occassionally visited the few Catholics scattered
							here and there. The first priest visiting Muncie was Rev. Daniel Maloney, who came
							from Indianapolis. The first Mass was celebrated at the house of Patrick Tuhey, on the
							site of the present public library. For nearly four years Father Maloney paid monthly
							visits, celebrating Mass alternately at the homes of Patrick Tuhey and Peter Mutch.
							Patrick Tuhey is no more, but Peter Mutch and his wife, both nearly ninety years of
							age, still occupy the old home of the early missionary days. Father Maloney had to
							make his journey from Indianapolis on horseback.</p>

						<p>Rev. August Bessonies attended Muncie, from Indianapolis, in 1855 and 1856. Rev.
							Michael Clark came to Muncie, in 1857. He also attended the missions of Winchester,
							Anderson <pb id="VAB8203-323" n="323"/> and Union City. His efforts to build a church
							in Muncie were not successful. Missionary visits continued, for short periods of time,
							by Revs. Simon Siegrist, and Theodore Van der Poel, John McMahon, John Gueguen, Daniel
							Maloney and William Doyle. Rev. FitzMaurice took charge in the early sixties and
							ministered to the spiritual wants for three years. Revs. John Bleckmann and Frederick
							Von Schwedler both attended Muncie from Union City. The Rev. Lawrence Lamoor, of Union
							City, began the building of the church in 1869. The congregation at that time numbered
							seventy-five members, none of them rich, but what they lacked in wealth, they supplied
							in zeal and perseverance. Lots were bought on the corner of Charles and Hackley
							streets, upon which the church was built. It was a brick building, 35x60 feet in size.
							St. Lawrence, the deacon, was named the patron of the church. It was dedicated in 1873
							by Bishop Dwenger. Rey. Joseph A. Marshall had charge of Muncie, from June to
							September 1873. Rev. John B. Crawley, of Anderson, succeeded Father Marshall from
							September 1873 till December 1874. He attended Muncie once a month, and paid off all
							but $250 of the indebtedness of the church.</p>

						<p>The present pastor, the Rev. William George Schmidt, was appointed pastor of Muncie
							on January 28, 1875. At that time the congregation had about forty-five families. He
							erected a small frame residence, which served as a priest's house until 1899, when he
							built the present rectory, at a cost of about $7,000. The first pastoral residence was
							partially destroyed by fire, on November 1, 1880. Father Schmidt built a frame
							school-house in 1881, wherein he himself taught, from 1881 to 1882. He attended
							Hartford City in 1875, and Montpelier from 1875 to 1896. Sick calls to Hartford City,
							Montpelier, and the surrounding country, were made by such modes of travel as
							horseback, handcars, and other primitive conveniences.</p>

						<p>The present church edifice, planned in the Gothic style of architecture and cruciform
							in shape, was built by Father Schmidt and dedicated by Bishop Rademacher, on the feast
							of the Nativity of our Lady, 1895. The altars and furniture are of oak. The cost of
							the church was $43,000. It has a seating capacity of 950. After the new church was
							built, the <pb id="VAB8203-324" n="324"/> old church was converted into two
							school-rooms, which, with the frame structure erected in 1881, served for the
							accommodation of the children until 1901, in the spring of which year Father Schmidt
							began the erection of the present school. The work progressed throughout the spring
							and summer of 1901, and in October of that year, two rooms were ready for occupancy.
							These rooms accommodated those children, who had formerly attended in the "Old Church"
							school-rooms, which latter Father Schmidt tore down, at this period. He rented, for
							the first four to six weeks of the fall term, two rooms in a neighboring building,
							formerly used as a blacksmith shop, and many of the children now attending school
							laughingly recall their school days in the "Blacksmith Shop." The other rooms of the
							new school were ready for their purpose by December, 1901. The building contains eight
							well lighted, thoroughly ventilated, and finely equipped school-rooms, each 27x27
							feet. Two spacious halls separate the rooms on each of the two floors. A large hall
							occupies the third floor. The heating and other conveniences are of the modern type.
							The cost of the building is about $20,000. The indebtedness on the church property is
							$17,000.</p>

						<p>The school was first taught by the pastor, later by a lay-teacher, then by the
							Sisters of St. Joseph, and since 1886 by the Sisters of St. Agnes, from Fond du Lac,
							Wisconsin. Eight Sisters are engaged in teaching the 403 children, who attend the
							school. The eight grades are followed by a modification of the ordinary high school

							1870.</head>

						<p>In 1870, Rev. George A. Hamilton built St. Ann's Chapel on the corner of Wabash
							avenue and Smith street, in Lafayette, at a cost of $5,000. This chapel was a
							two-story, brick building arranged for church and school purposes, and services were
							held here, every Sunday, by one of the priests of St. Mary's Church. On the advice of
							Father Walters, St. Ann's was made an independent parish by Bishop Dwenger, in
							September 1884. Rev. John Dempsey was appointed its first pastor, who at once built a
							pastoral residence. He was removed to Valparaiso, August 24, 1888.</p>

						<p>Father Dempsey's immediate successor, was the Rev. Patrick F. Roche. Father Roche,
							recognizing the necessity of a new church began the work on the present St. Ann's
							Church in May 1896. On September 12, 1897, Bishop Rademacher laid the corner-stone
							with elaborate ceremonies, and in the presence of at least 3,000 people. The church is
							a handsome structure, built of brick and stone, 143x53 feet. The cost of the building,
							including the furnishings, amounted to $20,000. The furniture of the church, altars,
							pews, railing, organ, the vestments and sacred vessels cost, in the aggregate, about
							$8,000. The seating capacity is 640, and 200 in the gallery, total of 840. The old
							church is being used for school purposes. The dimensions of the building are 145x44
							feet. It is divided into three school-rooms and can accommodate 180 pupils. The eight
							grades are taught, and the Sisters of Providence have had charge, from the beginning;
							they reside in a rented house. At the present time, three Sisters have charge of 143
							children. There is a debt of $5,100 on the church property.</p>

						<p>St. Ann's has a Living Rosary Society, for married men and women, since 1892,
							seventy-four members; the St. Ann's <pb id="VAB8203-326" n="326"/> Cadets, for single
							men, since 1897, forty-three members; the Young Ladies' Sodality, since 1890,
							ninety-five members; the Children of Mary, since 1902, sixty-two members; the Holy
							Angels' Society, eighty members, and the Sacred Heart League, with forty-eight
							members. The C. B. L., the C. K. of A., the A. O. H., and the Ladies' Auxiliary A. O.

						<p>St. Ann's has had two resident pastors: Rev. John Dempsey, from September 1884 till
							August 1888; Rev. Patrick F. Roche, from August 24, 1888 till May 16, 1901. The
							present pastor, Rev. Michael F. Byrne, has had charge since May 16, 1901.</p>

						<p>The Indiana State Soldiers' Home, near Lafayette, has in it a chapel for the
							accommodation of the Catholic inmates, since 1896. Rev. P. F. Roche was instrumental
							in securing these accommodations, consisting of one large room in the rear of one of
							the main buildings, at the Home; it is fully furnished with altar, vestments and other
							requisites, as well as pews. Services are held there, by the pastor of St. Ann's, on
							week days only, with an average attendance of about twenty-five.</p>

						<p>Rev. John Blum was assistant at St. Ann's, from July till December 28, 1905. The

						<p>While residing in Kentland, Rev. A. Messmann had charge <pb id="VAB8203-328" n="328"
							/> of St. Anthony's, where, on April 24, 1869, he organized the nineteen families into
							a parish, began the building of a church and finished the same in 1870. It is the
							present church. The church grounds are composed of ten acres of land. In 1869, Anthony
							Dehner donated five acres for church and cemetery and, in 1876, Bernard Quante donated
							five acres for priest's house and pasture. The dimensions of the church are 54x60
							feet. In 1894, Rev. J. Baker made extensive repairs, by lining the ceiling and
							replastering the church, at a cost of $250 and, in 1898 and 1899, Rev. F. J. Bilstein
							added a sacristy and had the church frescoed, at a cost of $2,023. $1,500 of this
							amount was secured by three funded Masses. The seating capacity of the church is
							240.</p>

						<p>The priest's house was built in 1876, by Rev. F. X. Ege. It was a one-and-a-half
							story house to which, in 1884, a kitchen and dining room were added by the Rev. F. J.
							Lambert. A barn was built by Rev. J. Hoss, in about 1880 or 1881. It was struck by
							lightning and burned. Another stable was built at once, this too was destroyed by fire
							in 1899. The third stable and barn combined were built by Father Bilstein, for $300.
							.The church property is free of debt. The number of souls is 157, or twenty-five
							families. In 1885, a large number of French Catholics began to come here, so that the
							parish increased to ninety families, but within ten years the French Catholics left
							the place. One girl of the parish has entered a religious community. The parish has

							1870.</head>

						<p>Walkerton derived its name from a Mr. Walker, who constructed the Lake Erie railroad
							from Walkerton to Michigan City. Prior to that time it was known as East Troy, West
							Troy and West York. About 1856, the Rev. Paul Gillen and Rev. John Curley, Fathers of
							the Holy Cross, residing at Notre Dame, said Mass in an old log cabin on Kyram
							Devery's farm. In 1870, Rev. Timothy D. O'Sullivan, residing at Laporte, paid
							occasional visits to Walkerton. The number of souls at that time was about forty,
							mostly Irish. Father O'Sullivan built the church, a frame structure 45x22 feet,
							costing about $800. "The pews had no backs to them, and the window sills served for
							lamp stands." Most of the money was collected along the railroad line. Rev. M. E.
							Campion, also residing at Laporte, succeeded Father O'Sullivan. The church at that
							time was called St. Henry's Church. In October 1881, the Rev. H. F. Joseph Kroll,
							pastor at Chesterton, took charge of Walkerton. From September 1, 1895 to February 4,
							1897 Rev. Dominic Shunk, C. PP. S., residing at Wanatah, was visiting pastor. Next
							came Rev. Edward Jakob, C. PP. S., till September 1, 1897; Rev. Raymund Vernimont, C.
							PP. S., till January 18, 1898, both residing at Wanatah. Rev. Adam M. Buchheit,
							residing at Wanatah, attended the place till September 10, 1899.</p>

						<p>The first resident pastor was the Rev. Henry C. Kappel, from September 10, 1899 to
							July 18, 1901. He bought the house, adjacent to the church, for a pastoral residence.
							Father Kappel was succeeded by Rev. Peter Budnik, from July 18, 1901 to June 5, 1902.
							Since this latter date, the present pastor, Rev. Joseph Abel, has had charge.</p>

						<p>The church grounds consist of two lots. In 1886, Father Kroll built a gallery in the
							church, and procured an organ; and in 1889 he built an addition of 25x45 feet to the
							church. Father Shunk, in 1895, erected a belfry and put in it a bell, and in 1896 gave
							the church stained glass windows. Father Abel, since his arrival, has made several
							improvements and <pb id="VAB8203-330" n="330"/> many repairs. The seating capacity of
							the church is about 150. The priest's house owes its present, neat appearance to
							Father Abel. The church property is out of debt. St. Patrick's parish has two
							societies: The Rosary Society, organized in 1899, and the Sacred Heart Society, in
							June 1902. The number of souls at the present time is eighty-one, or twenty-four
							families.</p>

						<p>St. Peter's church property, known as St. Peter's Square, is bounded on the north by
							St. Martin's street, on the east by Hanna street, on the south by Dewald street, and
							on the west by Warsaw street; it measures 150x450 feet. Three of the lots were
							purchased in 1871, one of the lots was donated by Father Wemhoff, and five lots were
							purchased about the same time; total cost $6,000. The first building erected was a
							two-story brick structure, 40x70 feet. The first floor served as school, accommodating
							comfortably 250 pupils, and the second, as church, with a seating capacity of 300. The
							total cost was about $10,000. Rev. John Wemhoff was the pastor at the time.</p>

						<p>The present church was built during the pastorate of Rev. A. Messmann, in 1892 and
							1893. Its dimensions are 190x80 feet and its cost was $65,000. It is a Gothic
							structure of pleasing design. The present pastor, Rev. Charles Thiele, is furnishing
							the church with a beautiful altar, Stations of the Cross and a pulpit. When completed
							the church with the furnishings will represent an outlay of $75,000. The debt on the
							church property is $22,000.</p>

						<p>During the pastorate of Rev. Ferdinand Koerdt, in 1905, a new school building was
							planned, which, when completed, will be one of the most imposing and best equipped
							school-houses in Fort Wayne, and will have cost fully $60,000. One wing only of the
							new building is now standing at an expense of $18,000, furnishing accommodations for
							200 children. The <pb id="VAB8203-331" n="331"/> present pastor, Father Thiele, has
							installed a central heating plant, to serve all the buildings on the premises, at a
							cost of $11,000.</p>

						<p>Up to 1881 lay-teachers taught the children, but in that year the School Sisters of
							Notre Dame took change of the school. Eight Sisters are engaged in teaching the eight
							grades, and one in the higher branches. The school has an attendance of 446 pupils.
							The Sisters reside in a home, specially erected for them, in 1880 by Father Messmann,
							a commodious two-story brick structure, 30x65 feet, costing about $3,000. The school
							is supported by the St. Joseph's School Society, which was organized in the very
							beginning, and to which all heads of families belong. It may be mentioned that the
							members of this society are either active, or passive, or honorary members. The active
							members are the heads of families, who send children to school. They pay eight dollars
							initiation (in installments, if preferred) and seventy-five cents per month, no matter
							how many children they send. The passive members are heads of families, who have as
							yet no children old enough to attend school. They pay twenty-five cents per month,
							until their children go to school; the amount having been paid in by that time is
							accepted in payment of the initiation fee as part or whole payment of the same as the
							case may be. The honorary members are the heads of families who have no children to
							send to school; they pay twenty-five cents per month. Any single person may become an
							honorary member.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house, built in 1872, was a frame building, 20x30 feet, with an
							addition of 8x12 feet. It was removed and is at present number 2007, on Hanna street.
							The present priest's house was formerly located where the church now stands. It is a
							frame building and was moved to its present location in 1892. It was twice enlarged,
							at considerable expense, and its value is about $3,000.</p>

						<p>Besides the School Society, with 170 members, the parish also has the following: St.
							Martin's Benevolent Society, with eighty-eight members, organized in 1874, assists its
							members in time of sickness and death; St. Stephen's Society for young men, with
							eighty-five members; St. Agnes' Society for young women, with 145 members, and the
							Guardian Angel's Society, for children, with 125 members, have been in existence since
								<pb id="VAB8203-332" n="332"/> the organization of the parish. The Rosary Society is
							the oldest society, for married women. The Christian Mothers' Society has a membership
							of 312. These societies have been most helpful in contributing towards the church
							furnishings. To mention one item, they have contributed $5,000 for a new altar. Still
							other Societies are: The Catholic Knights of America, with fourteen members, the
							Catholic Benevolent Legion, seventeen members, the Catholic Benevolent League,

						<p>Although it is known that missionaries visited these parts at an early date, still

							1855. He resided at Michigan City. He celebrated Mass in the house of John Mellane,
							near Hobart. After Father Gillen came Rev. John Force, residing at Valparaiso, from
							1858 to 1859. He said Mass in the same house. The Rev. Alexius Botti, residing at
							Valparaiso, came next. He celebrated Mass in John Ormand's home. It was in the year
							1871, that Rev. M. O'Reilly began to visit Hobart from Valparaiso, his place of
							residence. Until 1873 he celebrated Mass in the home of John O'Doyle, when he bought
							some lots on which to build a church. These three lots had an old picture gallery on
							it, which was converted into a church; a building sixty years old, and in use today.
							$1,100 was paid for the property, at the time; of this amount Father O'Reilly paid
							over $700 and his successor, Rev. F. X. Baumgartner, the rest. The number of souls at
							this time was about <pb id="VAB8203-333" n="333"/> 100. The succession of priests
							attending Hobart, was the following: Rev. Paul Gillen, C. S. C., Michigan City, from

							1904.</p>

						<p>The old church was much improved and beautified by Father Stetter, the interior is
							nicely frescoed with eight handsome paintings and has three beautiful altars. Father
							Jansen, during his pastorate, has also spent over $1,000 in repairing, improving and

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">BARRYDALE.</hi><lb/> ST. BRIDGET'S CHURCH<lb/>
							1873.</head>

						<p>Barrydale, formerly known as the "Ditch," was so termed on account of a big open
							ditch a mile or so from the church, which served to drain the low, swampy country. In
							the <pb id="VAB8203-334" n="334"/> autumn of 1901, it was named Barrydale. St.
							Bridget's Church was attended by priests from Lafayette; Rev. F. Joseph Stephan, about
							the year 1860, celebrated Mass in private houses from time to time. The same can be
							said of Rev. E. B. Kilroy in 1862, and of Rev. C. J. O'Callaghan, in 1864. In the year
							1870, the Rev. John R. Dinnen, residing at Oxford, began to pay St. Bridget's regular
							visits. At this time the Catholic population did not exceed a dozen families.</p>

						<p>The first little frame church was built, in 1873, at a cost of $800, by Rev. Meinrad
							McCarthy, O. S. B. This building still stands and is now used for a hall. Father
							Dinnen, of Oxford, had charge of the mission until 1875, and Rev. Thomas M. Cahill,
							until 1878. Father Cahill was succeeded by the Rev. John Dempsey, who for a short time
							lived in a farm house near by, then moved to Fowler and attended the mission from
							there, till 1882, when again it was visited from Oxford, by the Rev. P J. Crosson,
							till 1894. The number of families had now increased to about thirty-five. The church
							grounds comprise about two acres. One acre was secured for $50 in 1873 by the
							Benedictine Father McCarthy; and the rest, by the present pastor, also for a
							consideration of $50, being less than half its actual value. The parish never had a
							cemetery of its own, its dead being buried in Lafayette or Oxford. Nor has there been
							ever a Catholic school in the place, owing to the long distance the children would
							have to come. The present church was built, in 1896, by the Rev. W. Conrad Miller
							residing at Oxford, at a cost of about $7,000. It is a handsome and substantial brick
							structure with a seating capacity of about 325. The congregation has forty-three
							families, numbering 245 souls.</p>

						<p>The present and only priest's house, the place has had, was built in the summer of
							1901 by the Rev. Charles E. McCabe, the first resident pastor, at an outlay of about
							$3,500. It is a fine frame structure of ten rooms, with all modern conveniences, and
							complete in every detail. The church property has a debt of $2,600.</p>

						<p>The Societies, organized in the summer of 1901, were: The Rosary Society for married
							men and women, with thirty members; the Sodality of the Children of Mary for young
							women and girls, with eighteen members, and the Sodality of the Holy Name for young
							men and boys, with twenty members. <pb id="VAB8203-335" n="335"/> Aside from the
							spiritual purposes, for which these organizations were called into existence, the same
							are also helpful in a material way, by furnishing the church and sanctuary with many
							necessary and useful articles.</p>

						<p>The present pastor, the Rev. Michael J. Ford, was appointed on July 22, 1906. He has
							secured additional ground, has beautified the place, and has made several necessary
							improvements.</p>

						<p>The Rev. John H. Oechtering was the first priest to visit Otis, or Salem Crossing, as
							it was then known, and the neighboring country. The Catholic population, in the year
							1870, consisted of about forty-five Polish and two or three German families. Father
							Oechtering, who was the resident pastor at Laporte for ten years, built the first
							church at Otis in 1873 and secured the services of the Rev. Francis X. Szulak, S. J.,
							of Chicago several times a year to give the Polish families an opportunity of
							receiving the sacraments. Shortly after, the Rev. Peter Koncz began to reside at Otis,
							and became its first resident pastor, making his home with private families. His
							successor was Rev. Ludwig Machdzicki, who built the first priest's house and remained
							till 1881. In August, 1881, the Rev. Urban Raszkiewicz was appointed pastor at Otis,
							where he continues to live and labor at the present time, the venerable pastor of St.
							Mary's Church, in the eighty-fourth year of his age.</p>

						<p>The church property contains five acres of land, part of which is used for cemetery

							building, and can seat 400 people. It has a chime of three bells, in a belfry beside
							the church. The school was <pb id="VAB8203-336" n="336"/> built by Father Machdzicki,
							in 1880; it is a two-story frame building with basement, and has two class-rooms, and
							private rooms for the Sisters and boarders; it cost $2,000. The average attendance at
							school is seventy pupils. Two Felician Sisters, from the Mother-house at Detroit,
							Michigan, teach English and Polish branches. The priest's house with additions and
							improvements has cost about $3,000. There is no debt on the church property.</p>

						<p>The parish has three Societies, two are sodalities and one is beneficiary. St. Mary's
							Congregation has given the church two priests and four Sisters. Otis has 110 families,
							comprising 500 souls. Unable to attend to his pastoral duties, on account of old age,
							Father Raszkiewicz received Rev. P. A. Budnik for his assistant, on June 8, 1907.</p>

						<p>Rev. August Young visited Auburn, for the first time, on August 5, 1872, finding
							eight Catholic families in that place. For two years he had services in the house of
							E. Ashley, on West Seventh street. The foundation for the present church was laid on
							June 1, 1874, on the corner of Fourth and Railroad streets, and the church was
							dedicated by Bishop Dwenger on October 18th, of the same year. The building cost
							$3,000, and the total amount was paid on the day after the dedication. The present
							priest's residence adjoining the church, was bought for $1,900, on April 15, 1874. The
							congregation at that time numbered 300 souls, and had no debt on the church property.
							By order of the Bishop, Father Young changed his place of residence from Auburn to
							Garrett, on November 10, 1886, but continued to visit Auburn from Garrett, until
							November 1, 1891.</p>

						<p>The resident pastors succeeding Father Young at Auburn were the following: Rev.
							Rudolph Denk, eight months; Rev. Francis P. Faust, from June 1892 till November 1895;
							Rev. Edward J. Boccard, from November 1895 till September 1898; Rev. Frederick J.
							Dandurand, from September 1898 to July 1900; Rev. John M. Schmitz, since July 13,
							1900.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-337" n="337"/>

						<p>On August 30, 1881, four and a half acres of ground, known as Mader's addition to the
							town of Auburn, were bought for $543.54, and have since been St. Mary's Cemetery,
							serving Auburn, Garrett, and missions for burial purposes, up to 1897. Since his
							accession, the present pastor, Father Schmitz, has done much toward improving the
							church property. The Rosary Society for married women, with twenty-four members, a
							Sodality for single women, with twenty-three members, proved beneficial to the parish
							in many respects. At present, Auburn has forty Catholic families, numbering 161 souls.
							The debt on the church property is $160.</p>

							1874.</head>

						<p>The pastors of St. Michael's Church were: Rev. Henry Meissner, Crown Point, from 1874
							till September 1875; Rev. Godfrey Kueng, from 1875 till October 1876; a vacancy, from
							October 1876 till February 1877; Rev. John Henry Bathe, from February 16, till August
							18, 1877; Rev. F. X. Deimel, from August 1877 till May 28, 1881; during Father
							Deimel's illness, Rev. Eustachius Vollmer, O. F. M., and Rev. Charles Rosenbauer, C.
							SS. R., attended the parish; Rev. William Berg, since May 28, 1881.</p>

						<p>Schererville exists since 1866. All the old settlers of these regions were Catholic,
							and according to convenience attended the churches at St. John, Turkey Creek, Crown
							Point or Dyer. In the year 1874, Bishop Dwenger approved the project of building a
							church at Schererville, and placed the undertaking under the supervision of Rev. Henry
							Meissner, pastor at Crown Point. Four and a quarter acres of land, for church and
							cemetery purposes, were donated by Nicholas Scherer, after whom the town is named. The
							church was a frame structure 45x95 feet, with a tower 100 feet. It was dedicated by
							Bishop Dwenger at the end of September 1874, and placed under the patronage of St.
							Michael, the Archangel. The church cost $5,000. The congregation was anxious to have a
							resident priest, and, with this end in view, they built a priest's house at a cost of
							about $1,800, in 1875.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-338" n="338"/>

						<p>Rev. Godfrey Kueng was the first resident pastor; he was a good priest, but, having
							no taste for financial matters, he resigned in October 1876, and returned to his
							native country in Tyrol. Father Bathe provided some vestments, and Father Deimel
							procured two. bells, stations of the Cross and both these pastors reduced the debt.
							Father Deimel's health was not good. He spent about two years in the Alexian Brothers'
							Hospital, at St. Louis. When Father Berg took charge he found a debt of $2,300. He
							made many improvements and repairs on the church and house, and when, in the summer of
							1889, all the church debt had been paid, he was given a three months' vacation to
							visit his native country; during which time his brother, Rev. John B. Berg had charge
							of the parish.</p>

						<p>The cemetery is adjacent to the church, on the west side, and was blessed by Bishop
							Rademacher, on September 27, 1895. In the year 1893, the church was frescoed, and
							repaired at a cost of $1,200. The Main Altar and the two Side Altars and their
							statuary were provided gradually, costing probably $1,300. The church received ten
							'stained glass windows in 1889, a new roof in 1890, a hot air furnace underneath the
							church and in 1897, a pipe organ. The church is supplied with vestments, sacred
							utensils and everything necessary in the line of furniture.</p>

						<p>Father Berg secured the services of the Sisters of St. Francis, of Joliet, in 1886,
							to teach the public school. They had lived in a rented house for two years, when a
							separate residence was built for them, in 1888. The public school arrangement proved
							unsatisfactory, for many reasons. In 1893, the old public school building was sold,
							and 20x24 feet of it was moved to the church for school purposes, and, in the year
							1900, an addition was made to it, affording two roomy apartments for school purposes.
							The building was blessed on September 15, 1900, and on the day after the school opened
							with an attendance of 42 pupils. The school building measures 24x50 feet, and cost
							$1,200.</p>

						<p>St. Michael's has these Societies; St. Mary's Altar Society, over twenty-five years
							old, has done much for the sanctuary. St. Michael's Society for men. The Catholic
							Order of Foresters. The Columbian League of Indiana. The Young Ladies' Sodality of the
							Blessed Virgin. Ten young ladies of <pb id="VAB8203-339" n="339"/> the parish have

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">TIPTON.</hi><lb/> ST. JOHN'S CHURCH.<lb/> 1874.</head>

						<p>Tipton changed its name from Kingston to Canton and then to Tipton. The town was laid
							out in 1844, and in those days Catholics in Tipton and vicinity were few and far
							between. The first priest, as far as can be ascertained, who said Mass in Tipton
							county, was Rev. Simon Siegrist, pastor of St. Mary's Church, at Indianapolis, who, on
							occasion of a sick call to Tipton, said Mass in the home of John Murphy. In 1856, Rev.
							D. Maloney came occasionally and said Mass alternately at the homes of John Murphy at
							Tipton, and of James Sheil at Shieldsville (now Atlanta), five miles south of Tipton.
							Next came Rev. B. J. Force, stationed at Peru. After him, Rev. Bernard Kroeger from
							Peru, who having assistants from 1864 to 1871 attended Tipton, at regular intervals.
							These assistants were: Rev. C. Mougin 1864, Rev. Lawrence Lamoor 1865, Rev. Michael
							Hanley 1867, Rev. B. T. Borg 1869, Rev. P. Frawley 1870, and Rev. J. H. O'Brien in
							1871. Rev. John Grogan attended Tipton as a station, from Kokomo.</p>

						<p>Rev. Francis Lordemann, pastor at Kokomo, attending Tipton built the first church
							there in 1874, a small frame structure 30x40 feet, costing $1,200. At that time the
							congregation at Tipton consisted of fifteen families. The church grounds consist of
							seven lots; three of these, on which the church and priest's house stand, were secured
							by Father B. Kroeger in 1866; the four lots constituting the school grounds, were
							secured by Rev. F. G. Lentz, while pastor at Tipton. The Sisters of St. Joseph erected
							their convent on four lots, adjoining the school property.</p>

						<p>The Rev. F. G. Lentz became the first resident pastor of St. John's Church, at
							Tipton, in July 1876. In 1881 he built <pb id="VAB8203-340" n="340"/> an addition
							30x30 feet to the church. The church was destroyed by fire, on the evening of December
							14, 1885, caused by a defective flue. Until the completion of the new church divine
							services were held, first in one of the school-rooms, and later, when the school
							building had been completed, in the hall upstairs. The corner-stone for the new church
							was laid, on the site of the old, by Bishop Dwenger, June 16, 1889. Father Lentz
							remained long enough to see the church under roof, when he was succeeded by Rev.
							Anthony J. Kroeger, on June 5, 1890. Father Kroeger completed the church, and it was
							dedicated on August 30, 1891. Owing to the sickness of Bishop Dwenger, Very Rev. J. H.
							Brammer, V. G., officiated. The church is built in Gothic style, of brick and stone,
							has two towers, one 165 and the other 80 feet high. The dimensions are 130x60 feet,
							with a frontage of 85 feet. A life-size statue of St. John the Baptist is seen over
							the center entrance door. The church has three double entrance doors. In 1895, massive
							pews of quartered oak were placed, at a cost of $1,500. In 1898, the towers were
							completed and the brick work was tuck-pointed, at a cost of $3,000. In 1900,
							excavation for basement was made and the steam heating plant installed, for $3,000. In
							1901, the church received electric light, for $600. In the same year three altars were
							placed; the main altar costing $1,000 was donated by Francis Mattingly, one of the
							side altars costing $500 was presented by James Sheil. In 1903, a set of stations of
							the Cross (statuary) was added, the gift of F. J. Froelich, having cost $800. In the
							same year two large transept windows 30x16 feet, one representing the Nativity of our
							Lord and the Adoration by the Magi, the other His Ascension, were placed at a cost of
							$1,700. In 1904, the church was refrescoed, a work of art throughout; the side walls
							are done in plain olive green, the ceiling divided into fields contains the twelve
							Apostles life-size, and over the transept windows are seen the four Evangelists. The
							sanctuary especially is beautifully done. The cost of this work was $2,000. In 1906, a
							new pipe organ was installed, at a cost of $3,000.</p>

						<p>The school-house, erected by Father Lentz in 1885, was a two-story brick and stone
							building, 65x50 feet, with two school-rooms on the first floor, and the second floor
							the hall for society meetings, school entertainments, provided with stage, etc. <pb
								id="VAB8203-341" n="341"/> The cost was about $5,000. From 1885 to 1888, the school
							was taught by lay-teachers, after which the Sisters of St. Joseph took charge. The
							Sisters resided in a cottage, on the southeast corner of the school property, until
							the summer of 1891, when they moved into their new convent, adjoining the school
							property opposite the church. The usual grades are taught, including high school. The
							number of pupils is 133.</p>

						<p>The first priest's house was built, in 1876, by Father Lentz. It was a
							story-and-a-half brick house, with eight small rooms. In 1897, a new priest's house, a
							two-story brick and stone building was erected by Father Kroeger. It is a house of
							twelve, well arranged, commodious rooms, with a basement of five rooms. The building
							cost only $7,000. The little frame house, used for a time by the Sisters, is still
							there, and answers the purpose of an infirmary, when needed.</p>

						<p>The Catholic cemetery consists of two acres, adjoining the non-Catholic cemetery,
							southwest of the city limits. It was bought by Father Lentz, in 1879 for $150. The
							church property is without debt. St. John's Parish has the Emerald Benevolent
							Association, organized in 1885, by Father Lentz. This society merged into the present
							St. John's Benevolent Association, in 1890, and has a membership of fifty. The
							Catholic Benevolent Legion of Indiana, since 1900, with thirty-five members. The Young
							Men's Sodality, since 1890, with sixty members. The Rosary Confraternity, since 1895,
							with eighty-five members. The Young Ladies' Sodality, since 1877, with sixty-five
							members. The Holy Angels' Society, since 1906, with nineteen members. The women's
							societies look after the needs of the sanctuary. The number of souls is 675, or 142
							families, and three girls of the parish have entered the convent. The pastorate of
							Father Kroeger continued until January 1, 1907, when he was succeeded by the Rev.
							Anthony Henneberger.</p>

							1875.</head>

						<p>The town of Fowler was platted October 27, 1872, and was named after its founder.
							About twelve Irish Catholic families settled in the town. In the fall of 1874, Rev.
							John <pb id="VAB8203-342" n="342"/> R. Dinnen, then pastor of Oxford, visited Fowler
							and made preparations for the building of a church. Moses Fowler donated four lots, or
							one-half block, and Father Dinnen bought the other half for $100, and donated it. In
							the spring of 1875, a frame church was built, 22x40 feet, the furnishing of which
							consisted of a plain, little, home-made altar, three dozen second-hand pews, a set of
							vestments, linens and a small chalice. Bishop Dwenger dedicated the church, under the
							invocation of St. John, the Evangelist. Succeeding Father Dinnen in October 1875, Rev.
							Meinrad McCarthy, O. S. B., had charge of Oxford and Fowler until October 6, 1877. In
							September 1875, Bishop Dwenger bought 200 acres of land a half mile south of Fowler,
							on which to erect a Catholic College. The conveyance was made upon condition, that the
							deed would be void if the grantee would fail to erect a college building, worth a
							specified sum, within one year. Bishop Dwenger left the matter in the hands of Father
							McCarthy, who failed to interest the Abbey of St. Meinrad in the undertaking, and the
							whole project fell through.</p>

						<p>Rev. John Lang pastor at Oxford, attended to Fowler, from October 1877 until April
							19, 1878. After him Rev. John Dempsey, from April 19, 1878 to January 1, 1882. He had
							charge also of St. Bridget's, as a mission. The congregation, at this time, numbered
							about twenty-five families. He built a priest's house, from his own means, which he
							occupied during his stay in Fowler. He fenced the entire church property. After him,
							Rev. P. J. Crosson was pastor of Fowler and the mission St. Bridget's, from January 1,
							1882 to June 15th of the same year. He was succeeded by Rev. C. J. Maujay, from June
							15, 1882 till May 1889. The mission, St. Bridget's, was now attended from Oxford and
							Earl Park, a mission, attached to Fowler. In 1887, however, Earl Park received a
							resident pastor, both places having now about forty families each. Father Maujay made
							a number of improvements; he purchased a new reed organ and organized a choir,
							provided a fine picture of the patron of the church, a set of new stations,
							ostensorium, cope, etc. Up to this time, he lived in a rented house; but in September,
							1882, he bought a little frame house of three rooms and moved it on the church lots.
							This dwelling, 20x26 feet, was enlarged by an addition of 12x12 feet. The ceiling was
								<pb id="VAB8203-343" n="343"/> eight feet high. This work cost $500. A barn was
							built, 20x24 feet, in 1883. In 1884, the number of families having increased to fifty,
							an addition of 20 feet was made to the church. In the same year he bought a bell,
							weighing 1,385 pounds. In May, 1889, Father Maujay left Fowler to visit his aged
							parents in France, once more. For one month the parish was visited, on Sundays, by
							Rev. Michael Byrne, assistant at the Cathedral of Fort Wayne. Rev. A. Henneberger,
							newly ordained, was appointed pastor at Fowler and took charge June 29, 1889. At this
							time the parish numbered twenty-eight Irish, twenty Canadian and twelve German
							families. The new pastor built a small sacristy to the rear of the church. He
							organized St. Ann's Society, for the married women, and the Sodality of the Blessed
							Virgin, for the single women, in 1889. In 1891, a frame building, 26x32 feet, was
							erected for $800, on the first floor of which a school was opened in September of that
							year, with an attendance of sixty-five children; and the second floor became the
							Sisters' residence. The Sisters of St. Francis have charge of the school. In 1892 an
							addition was made to this building, of 18x20 feet for $400. In the fall of 1894, it
							was resolved to build a new church, to cost about $10,000, and in May of 1895, the
							corner-stone was laid by Bishop Rademacher and on Ascension Day, 1896, the church was
							dedicated, in honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The church is built in the Gothic
							style of architecture, 46x112 feet. The steeple measures 125 feet, the interior
							elevation of the church is 38 feet, with a seating capacity of 400. The total cost,
							including furniture, was $15,000. The old school-house was now remodeled and made a
							priest's house, for $556.80, and the old church was changed into a two-room
							school-house, and the old priest's house, some what enlarged, was added to the school
							for a Sisters' residence, costing $491.</p>

						<p>In August, 1898, Father Henneberger was transferred to Attica and Rev. H. A. Hellhake
							took charge of Fowler, remaining until August 12, 1900. The new pastor improved the
							church property in several respects. Father Henneherger was made pastor of Fowler, a
							second time, from August 12, 1900 to January 1, 1907. Cement walks were put down in
							1902. In the same year a pipe organ was bought for $1,200. In 1903, twelve parishoners
							donated a set of stations of the Cross, <pb id="VAB8203-344" n="344"/> at an expense
							of $700. In 1904, he erected a one-story building, 40x60 feet, for $1,500 to be used
							for school purposes, since the old building had become wholly unfit for use. The eight
							grades are being taught by three Sisters, and the attendance is ninety-three. Four
							girls of the parish have become Sisters of St. Francis.</p>

						<p>The dead of the Sacred Heart Parish were buried in a cemetery, consisting of two
							acres of ground, but owing to a change of roadways, this cemetery was no longer
							desirable, and five acres were bought, situated along a public road, in 1895. It has a
							strong, iron fence and in the center a Crucifixion group, life size.</p>

						<p>The Societies here, are: The League of the Sacred Heart, 150 members; St. Ann's

						<p>The first priest to visit Remington was the Rev. Joseph Stephan, who came here from
							about 1860 to 1870. In 1870, Rev. Anthony Messmann, residing at Kentland, visited
							Remington regularly, celebrating Mass in the house of Timothy O'Connor, in the western
							part of town. At the same time Rev. August Young, residing at Rensselaer, said Mass
							from time to time in the home of John Eck, some eight miles northwest of here. At this
							time the number of families was about twenty-five. This state of things continued
							until 1875, when a frame church, 70x25 feet, serving the purposes of a school at the
							present time, was erected under the superintendence of <pb id="VAB8203-346" n="346"/>
							Father Messmann. The church grounds were bought at different times, three lots in
							1875, two in 1881, and one and a half in 1903. From 1876 till 1883, the Franciscan
							Fathers attended Remington, as a mission. Rev. John Wellinghoff, O. F. M., from 1876
							visited every two weeks. From 1879, Rev. Guido Stallo, O. F. M., and from 1881, Rev.
							John B. Schroeder, O. F. M. During his pastorate the sanctuary and sacristies were
							added to the frame church. At this time the congregation numbered about forty
							families.</p>

						<p>In 1883 the Sacred Heart Church at Remington received its first resident pastor in
							the person of Rev. J. H. Werdein. He erected a parochial residence of seven rooms at a
							cost of about $700. Rev. John B. Berg broke ground for the present church in 1899, and
							after two years the beautiful church was dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, on
							July 22, 1901. The old frame church was moved across the street and converted into a

							1876.</head>

						<p>About four families bought farms and settled in the wild prairie of the present
							Dunnington and surroundings, in 1870. They attended Mass, during the summer season, at
							Kentland, a distance of about seventeen miles. On July 7, 1874, the <pb
								id="VAB8203-347" n="347"/> Rev. John R. Dinnen, then pastor of Oxford, came out to
							the prairie, for the first time, and organized the new congregation, calling it St.
							Michael's. He secured two lots at Talbott and put in a foundation for a new church, to
							be a frame building, 30x40 feet. The congregation furnishing the stone and doing the
							hauling, the foundation cost $100. The foundation finished, the people objected to the
							building of the church at Talbott, because it was not centrally located. In the fall
							of 1875, Rev. Meinrad M. McCarthy, O. S. B., succeeded Father Dinnen at Oxford and
							visited Dunnington twice a month, celebrating Mass in a school-house. The record shows
							that he was paid $15 for each visit. By this time the congregation had increased to
							fifteen families, Irish, German and French. On August 12, 1876, Father McCarthy bought
							the one acre of land on which the church and house now stand, and opposite to it, he
							bought two acres for cemetery, at $40 per acre. A month later he let the contract for
							a frame church, 30x40 feet, for $850 and called it St. Columbkill's Church. The first
							services were held in the new church on Christmas-day, 1876, and Father McCarthy
							continued to visit St. Columbkill's twice a month,; until the fall of 1877, when he
							was succeeded by Rev. J. F. Lang.</p>

						<p>In 1881, Father Lang built an addition of 24x30 feet to the church and called it Holy
							Trinity Church. Hoffman's Directory of the next year called the place Langton. The
							number of families, at this time, was thirty-six. The pastorate of Father Lang
							terminated on April 30, 1882. Rev. John Grogan was the first resident pastor of the
							congregation, from June 25, 1882 till the summer of 1884. He built a pastoral
							residence, a one-and-a-half story frame structure, at a cost of $900. Father Grogan
							was succeeded by Rev. A. J. Strueder, who remained from the summer of 1884 till May
							15, 1888. On May 15, 1888, Rev. F. J. Lambert, the present pastor, took charge of the
							congregation. The number of families had now increased to seventy, owning three acres
							of ground, on one of which stood the church and house, and the other two acres were
							used for cemetery. In 1892, Father Lambert bought the corner lot on to which he moved
							the old church. Adjoining the church property, a quarter acre was donated for a new
							church. This new church, a substantial frame building of <pb id="VAB8203-348" n="348"
							/> 125x52 feet, was begun in July 1892 and was ready for occupancy on July 1st, of the
							following year. The cost of this church was $9,000. The architecture of it is Gothic.
							It was frescoed for $1,000. The tower is 133 feet high and has a chime of three bells.
							The furniture is all antique oak, costing $2,500. In 1905 the hot air furnaces were
							discarded, and replaced by a steam heating plant, at a cost of $1,165. A light plant
							was installed this spring, for the church and house, costing $300. The seating
							capacity of the church is about 600. Father Lambert changed the name to St. Mary's
							Church, the feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin being the patron feast.</p>

						<p>In the summer of 1893, a residence was built for the Sisters, opposite the church,
							being a two-story frame building, costing $1,500. The old church was remodeled into a
							school-house, with two commodious school-rooms and a large chapel, in which Mass is
							celebrated on week days during the winter season. In September, 1893, three Sisters of
							St. Francis opened the school with an attendance of eighty pupils, teaching the eight
							regular grades. The expense of the school is paid from the revenues of the church. The
							priest's house was remodeled in the fall of 1899 and a brick veneered building was
							added to it, at a cost of $4,950. It is a two-story building with basement and attic;
							it is heated by hot water, is lighted by acetylene gas and has all modern
							improvements. The entire church property has a debt of $2,890.</p>

						<p>St. Mary's has: The Catholic Order of Foresters, with a membership of sixty-four; St.
							Mary's Altar Society, with sixty members; St. Joseph's Society, with twenty-five
							members; the Purgatorian Society, with 150 members. The number of souls is 640,
							consisting of 117 families. The parochial school has an attendance of seventy-three
							children and is conducted by two Sisters of St. Francis, of Lafayette. Two of St.
							Mary's boys have become priests and five girls, Sisters.</p>

							1876.</head>

						<p>A small frame church, 24x26 feet, was built at Garrett and was opened for divine
							service, on June 29, 1876. The <pb id="VAB8203-349" n="349"/> congregation increasing
							rapidly, a cruciform addition of 110x50 feet was made to the church, in 1886. This
							addition, beautifully painted on the interior, with three altars and pulpit, stained
							glass windows and a bell cost $5,000. The seating capacity of the church was 300. A
							two-story pastoral residence, at a cost of $1,500, was provided and the first resident
							pastor, Rev. August Young, took possession of it, on November 10, 1886. In 1893,
							another addition had to be built to the church, increasing the seating capacity to
							500, costing $3,300. This, the SS. Peter and Paul's Church, was dedicated by Bishop
							Rademacher, on September 16, 1893.</p>

						<p>The present school-house, situated a hundred feet south of the church on Peter
							street, was begun in 1888, by erecting the main building, 54x32 feet, and one wing
							18x30 feet. This portion contains four school-rooms. At that time, 180 pupils were
							enrolled and the school was taught by five Sisters of the Precious Blood. In 1904, the
							school had become inadequate for the accommodation of the children to such a degree,
							that twenty-four children could not be admitted for want of room. Accordingly, in
							1905, the school was enlarged by completing it, after the original plan, giving four
							additional school-rooms. The building presents a beautiful appearance, built of brick,
							trimmed with Bedford stone, with an elevation of two-stories and basement. In all its
							appointments it is the most completely equipped school-house, in Dekalb county. At the
							present time, 226 pupils are in attendance. The usual eight grades are taught and the
							four grades of high school. Since 1894 a goodly number of pupils have graduated
							annually. The school can accommodate 400 children. It is a free school all expenses
							being paid by the School Society. Seven Sisters of the Precious Blood conduct the
							school.</p>

						<p>The congregation has 147 families, numbering 583 souls. The Sisters' residence was
							built in 1890 for $2,000.</p>

						<p>On the 10th day of January 1897, seven and a half acres of land were purchased just
							outside of the city limits, for $800. This plot of ground was laid out for cemetery,
							has 750 lots, beautiful drives and walks; and the total amount spent on it is about
							$3,000. The amount of debt on the church property is $2,550.</p>

							CONCEPTION.<lb/> 1876.</head>

						<p>The first priest, known to have visited Portland, was Rev. Joseph Dwenger, C. PP. S.,
							later Bishop of Fort Wayne, who celebrated Mass and preached in the Court House, at
							stated intervals. It was visited, as a station in 1873, by Rev. Paul Reuter, C. PP.
							S., from St. Mary's Home, near New Corydon. He came on horseback and celebrated Mass
							once a month on week days, at the home of F. V. Gigandet, about two and one-half miles
							northwest of Portland. The first Catholics of this neighborhood were mostly Irish.</p>

						<p>Father Reuter called a meeting of all the Catholics of Portland, consisting of about
							seven families, on April 3, 1875, at which it was determined to build a church.
							Everybody, Catholic and non-Catholic, in Portland and in the neighborhood of it
							contributed generously, and in a short time $600 were secured. A lot was bought on
							East Walnut street for $25. From 1876 till 1888 services were conducted, in the church
							at Portland, on two Sundays of every month by the Sanguinist Fathers from Fort
							Recovery, Ohio, and from St. Mary's Home, near New Corydon, Indiana. The church was
							built, in 1876, by the Rev. George Fleisch, C. PP. S., a frame structure, 28x40 feet,
							costing $1,185. Two additional lots were bought, in 1888, by Rev. Joachim Baker, at a
							cost of $1,200, on one of which stood a small cottage, which is used as the priest's
							residence. The Rev. L. A. Eberle, in 1906, remodeled the church and built an addition
							of 28x32 feet to the nave of the church, adding also a new sacristy 15x15 feet, at a
							cost of $1,900. The seating capacity of the church is about 200. The priest's house
							was remodeled and a kitchen, bath room and pantry added in 1903 by Father Paquet.</p>

						<p>The societies are: The Living Rosary Society since 1905 with thirty-two members; the
							Children of Mary, made up of boys and girls who have made their first communion, with
							twenty members. The number of souls is 180, consisting of forty families.</p>

							1876.</head>

						<p>Polish people have been arriving in South Bend since 1869. Up to 1877 they were part
							of St. Patrick's Congregation, and worshipped in the old St. Patrick's Church, on west
							Division street. Their spiritual wants were attended to by Polish priests from Chicago
							and from Otis, then known as Salem Crossing. Two of these priests were, Rev. Peter
							Koncz and Rev. Louis Machdzicki. The number of souls at this time had increased to 125
							families.</p>

						<p>On January 1, 1877, Rev. Valentine Czyzewski, C. S. C., took charge of the
							congregation, residing at St. Patrick's parochial residence. The first church, located
							on Monroe street, was started in the fall of 1876, and was finished and blessed on
							July 1, 1877. It was a frame structure, 83x40 feet, <pb id="VAB8203-352" n="352"/> and
							24 feet in height. The cost of this church was $3,500. In 1879, a cyclone totally
							destroyed this church. The present church property on Scott street was bought at a
							cost of $2,325 on January 18, 1880. The present St. Hedwig's Church was begun on
							August 12, 1881, and was dedicated April 15, 1883. The style is the Romanesque, its
							length 149 feet and the width sixty-two feet; the main walls being thirty-three feet
							in height and the steeple 156 feet. The altars used for several years were temporary,
							and the church, including pews, was erected at an outlay of $33,000. It was entirely
							remodeled in 1898: pillars were placed in position to support the roof, steel arched
							ceilings were provided, new pews replaced the old ones, together with decorations of
							various kinds, amounting in all to $7,300. In 1891, three very fine altars were
							donated by the societies of the church. The St. Hedwig's Society donated the Main
							Altar, costing $2,500. The two side altars were donated by the St. Stanislaus'
							Society, at a cost of $1,200. The organ was donated at an expense of $2.500, by the
							St. Casimir's Society. The seating capacity of the church is 920.</p>

						<p>The first school of brick, containing eight rooms and two offices, was built in 1884
							and was destroyed by fire, on February 4, 1886. The present school is three-stories in
							height and its dimensions are 126x62 feet. It contains twelve schoolrooms, a large
							hall and two rooms for office purposes. It has an attendance of 735 children. The
							school was erected in 1886, and cost $28,000. The interior was entirely repainted in
							1905, at an expense of $600. In the same year, an iron fence was built around the
							church property. The school is taught by eight Sisters of the Holy Cross arid five
							female lay-teachers. The Sisters reside in St. Joseph's Academy, one block away from
							St. Hedwig's school. The original school building is now used as a society room, and
							also for choir practice, as well as by St. Florian's Turners.</p>

						<p>The parochial residence is a frame building, and was moved to the present site in
							1884, having been purchased by Father Czyzewski at a cost of $3,000. An addition was
							made to the house in 1884; and the hot water heating apparatus, was provided for it,
							in 1904. This house is the first parochial residence and, until it was ready for
							occupancy, Father Czyzewski resided with the pastor of St. Patrick's Church.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-353" n="353"/>

						<p>St. Hedwig's Church has numerous societies: St. Stanislaus Kostka's Society, St.
							Casimir's, St. Hedwig's, St. Vincent de Paul's, St. Valentine's, St. Adalbert's, St.
							Florian's, the Apostleship of Prayer, the Young Ladies' Holy Rosary Society, the
							Children of Mary, the Guardian Angel Society and the Temperance Society. The number of
							souls in the parish is about 4000, or 828 families. There is a debt of $19,000 on the
							church property.</p>

						<p>Father Czyzewski has been the pastor of St. Hedwig's Church, since January 1, 1877.
							In 1896, he bought the lots for, and organized St. Casimir's Congregation, and in 1898
							he did the same for St. Stanislaus' Parish. He also built churches at Terre Coupee and
							Rolling Prairie. Among the assistants, Father Czyzewski has had, may be mentioned Rev.
							Michael Lauth, C. S. C., Rev. A. Zubowicz, C. S. C., Rev. C. Sztuczko, C. S. C., Rev.

							are the following: Rev. Edward O'Flaherty, Crawfordsville, 1859; Rev. George A.
							Hamilton, Logansport, 1860; Rev. A. B. Oechtering, Delphi, 1861; Rev. Francis
							Lordemann, Kokomo, 1874 till 1888; Rev. Leo Molengraft, O. F. M., from 1888 till 1890;

							Hordeman, since October 30, 1906.</p>

						<p>There is no record to show, that Father Badin, or any of the earliest missionaries
							visited Frankfort or its vicinity. Father O'Flaherty was the first to come from
							Crawfordsville, in 1859, as well as Father Hamilton, from Lafayette, in the year
							following. From the year 1875, Frankfort was attended once a month. In the beginning,
							the services were held at the house of Ignatius O'Leary. A lot 132x150 feet, on the
								<pb id="VAB8203-355" n="355"/> Jefferson gravel road, was bought in 1878 for $150. A
							frame structure, 40x20 feet, was erected on it for a church, and everything about the
							church was primitive and inexpensive. When Father Lordemann could no longer attend
							Frankfort, the Bishop gave the Franciscan Fathers of Lafayette charge of it, from 1888
							till 1892, and again from 1896 till 1898.</p>

						<p>Rev. John Blum was the first resident pastor, from July 1, 1892 till January 1896.
							Bishop Dwenger selected the present location on Walnut and Second streets, 132 feet
							square, for $1,500. A Gothic frame structure was erected on it in 1892, costing
							$4,000. The dimensions of the church are 72x35 feet. When Father Blum left, there was
							a debt of $700. After this the Franciscan Fathers of Lafayette visited the place twice
							a month. During their time an altar, new pews as well as the frescoing of the church
							were provided. All the debt had been paid, when Father O'Reilly took charge, and
							during his stay of nine months, he built the present parochial residence, costing
							$1,800. He left a debt of $1,000 after him. On June 19, 1906, Father Jansen bought a
							building, 51x17 feet, and moved it on the rear end of the church lot. It now serves
							the purpose of a hall, and later on may answer for school purposes. The cost of this
							improvement was $500. Father Jansen left the church at Frankfort, not only free from
							all indebtedness, but also with some money in the treasury.</p>

						<p>An Altar Society has been in existence, since 1874. It is for married women, and
							supplies the necessaries of the sanctuary. A Men's Society was organized in 1906, and

							1879.</head>

						<p>The first Catholic families, few in number, who settled on farms in the Calumet
							region, near the place now called Saxony, came in the year 1860. They attended the
							church in Turkey Creek. In the year following, Bishop Luers, accompanied by Rev.
							Philip Wegemeyer, the pastor at Turkey Creek, visited these families and celebrated
							Mass in the home of John L. <pb id="VAB8203-356" n="356"/> Knorzer. Bishop Luers
							promised them, that Father Wegemeyer would visit them a few times a year. Up to 1877,
							these visits were made by Father Wegemeyer, and by Rev. George Steiner, of Michigan
							City. Gradually Hammond began to be a village twelve families of which were Catholic.
							These families, and the other families at Saxony, attended Mass in the residence of
							William Klighe. At the solicitation of Rev. F. X. Baumgartner, pastor at Turkey Creek,
							M. Towle donated two lots, on State street near Hohman, in 1879, and in 1880, a
							donation of one acre of land, on the corner of Hohman and Russell streets, was
							received from Caroline Hohman. A small frame church 30x60 feet was erected in the
							summer of 1879, costing about $1,000; and Mass was celebrated in it, for the first
							time, by Father Baumgartner in December of the same year. Until the spring of 1883,
							the mission of Hammond was attended once a month, from Turkey Creek. On August 11,
							1881, John Verhofen donated one acre of land, situated on Hohman street and the Ridge
							Road, for cemetery purposes.</p>

						<p>In the year 1883, a priest's house was erected, costing about $2,400, of which Father
							Baumgartner took possession on April 7, 1883, as the first resident pastor of Hammond.
							His useful life came to a close, on May 9, 1885. The Rev. Philip Rothman, O. F. M.,
							who assisted him during his illness, had charge of the parish till August 10, 1885.
							The present pastor, Rev. Henry M. Plaster, has had charge since August 16, 1885. On
							May 30, 1883, Bishop Dwenger visited Hammond, on which occasion he blessed the church,
							administered Confirmation, and also blessed a bell.</p>

						<p>Immediately upon his arrival, Father Plaster erected a one-story building, 24x40
							feet, costing $600, for school purposes. School was opened in September of 1885, a
							lay-teacher having charge and the attendance being forty pupils. The following year
							the Sisters of Providence took charge, and the school building was increased to double
							its original size.</p>

						<p>In 1886 three acres were added to the cemetery. In the year 1888, the number of
							families had increased to such an extent, that the old church and school no longer
							sufficed, and Father Plaster determined to erect a two-story, 50x100 feet, church and
							school combination building. This building was completed at the close of January 1889.
							The first story <pb id="VAB8203-357" n="357"/> contained four large school-rooms, the
							second story was used for church purposes, and the cost of the building, including
							furniture, amounted to about $14,500. The building was dedicated by Bishop Dwenger, on
							September 29, 1889. The old school was remodeled for a Sisters' residence. In 1893,
							galleries were built in the church, and the seating capacity increased to 750. At this
							time, five acres of ground were secured for a new cemetery for $1,200. At an expense
							of $7,300, a residence was built for the Sisters; the building had three-stories and a
							basement and was completed on December 20, 1894. A belfry was erected, and a chime of
							three bells put in, blessed by Bishop Rademacher. In 1899, an addition was built to
							the church and school, 26x75 feet, costing $6,000 and a steam heating plant was
							installed for $1,700.</p>

						<p>In the year 1890, the Polish members of the congregation formed St. Casimir's Parish;
							and in 1896, All Saints' Congregation was organized, German Catholics only remaining
							with St. Joseph's Church. In 1901 the pipe organ was bought for $2,500. In 1902 the
							sum of $1,800 was expended for five acres additional to the cemetery. On December 12,
							1904, Rev. H. M. Plaster celebrated his Sacerdotal Silver Jubilee and the congregation
							the silver jubilee of its organization, with great solemnity. In memory of this double
							jubilee, a new parochial residence was provided. The building has three-stories and a
							basement, complete in every particular, including furniture, costing $17,000.</p>

						<p>The following were the pastors in charge of St. Joseph's Church: Rev. Philip
							Wegemeyer, Turkey Creek, from 1858 till 1875; Rev. George Steiner, Michigan City, from
							1858 till 1875; Rev. F. X. Baumgartner, Turkey Creek, from 1875 till 1881; Rev.

						<p>The Rev. John Hoss, pastor of St. Anthony's Church, attended to the spiritual wants
							of the Catholics in and about Earl Park. It was during his time, about the year 1880,
							that the first church was built capable of accommodating about 300 persons. The
							records indicate that the Rev. Joseph Stephan, Rev. F. X. Baumgartner, Rev. A.
							Messmann, Rev. C. Maujay and Rev. Thomas Vagnier, C. S. C., performed pastoral
							functions here. The latter was the first resident pastor at Earl Park, from 1887 till
							August 1895. The number of Catholic families at that time was about forty. The
							pastors, up to that time, were obliged to live in rented houses. But when Rev. P. J.
							Weber took charge he bought three lots east of the old church and on it erected a
							priest's house for $5,500 with all modern improvements.</p>

						<p>A new church now became a necessity and on September 28, 1902, the corner-stone of
							this new church was laid. The architecture of the building is Roman, with two massive
							towers. The interior decorations and the furnishings are in harmony with the
							architectural style of the building. The dimensions are generous; the seating capacity
							will be sufficient for six-hundred worshippers.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-359" n="359"/>

						<p>After the new church was ready for service the old church building was remodeled for
							a school. In this building there are three large school-rooms for the children, and

						<p>Goodland was a mission, from 1872 till October 1903. The priests, who attended the

							from 1900 till October 1903.</p>

						<p>Father Zern was the first resident pastor at Goodland, from October 2, 1903 till
							August 27, 1905, the date of his death in St. Joseph's Hospital at Logansport. Rev.
							Francis A. King, residing at Goodland was Father Zern's assistant, from June 1902 till
							Atigust 9, 1903. Rev. Ignatius F. Zircher has been the pastor at Goodland, since
							October 10, 1905.</p>

						<p>In 1877 Goodland had eight Catholic families. A lot was purchased, in 1880, and a
							frame church erected, at a cost of about $1,000, Father Hoss attending the place at
							the time. The priest's house is a very old dwelling, which stood on one of five lots,
							purchased in 1902, for $2,400, by Father Zern, attending the mission at the time.</p>

						<p>The present church is a brick edifice, 98x54 feet, with a seating capacity of 400.
							The exterior is imitation Gothic and the interior Roman. It cost about $14,000. The

							1881.</head>

						<p>Prior to 1868, Elwood was called Quincy. The earliest record of visits made by
							priests here, were the visits of Rev. Michael Clark and Rev. D. Maloney, of Lafayette,
							and Rev. FitzMaurice, of Anderson. From 1860 to 1865, Rev. John McMahon attended it
							from Anderson. The first Mass was celebrated in the house of John Buchanan, on the
							corner of Main and Sixteenth streets, in 1862. The Catholic population at that time
							consisted of half a dozen families, Irish and German, who were employed on the
							railroad. The so-called "section-house," in which Mass was frequently said, may still
							be seen on South B street. .Aside from these, Mass was celebrated also in the houses
							of Bernard Bauer, Gustave Kramer and Bridget Smith. Father McMahon bought two lots of
							ground on South A street, and his successor, Rev. J. B. Crawley, who attended Elwood
							from 1865 till 1884, from Anderson, erected the first church. It was a brick
							structure, 25x40 feet, with a sacristy 10x10 feet, and was dedicated by Bishop
							Dwenger, in the fall of 1881. The cost was $1,500. Rev. F. C. Wiechmann attended the
							Elwood mission from 1884 to 1889, from Anderson, on the fourth Sunday of each month.
							On July 29, 1889, Elwood received its first resident pastor, in the person of Rev. B.
							Biegel. At this time Elwood had a population of 800, with twenty Catholic families;
							but, owing to the discovery of natural gas, the town increased rapidly.</p>

						<p>A six-room priest's house, costing $1,000, was built next <pb id="VAB8203-361"
								n="361"/> to the little church, upon Father Biegel's arrival. In 1891, five acres of
							ground, located about one mile south-west of the town, were bought for a Catholic
							cemetery, at a cost of $600. In 1892, the church was enlarged to three times its size,
							and improved at a cost of $2,500. A bell also was bought that year.</p>

						<p>A one-room frame building, 26x40 feet, was put up north of the church, for $650. This
							was the beginning of the parish school, taught by a lay-teacher, Father Biegel hearing
							the classes in the priest's house. A second room, 26x25 feet, costing $550, was added
							in 1893. Eight lots adjoining the church property were secured in 1894, for $1,000. In
							September of this year, the Sisters of St. Joseph took charge of the parochial school.
							A residence was needed for the Sisters, who were living in a rented house across the
							street; and in 1896, the pastor gave them his own residence. A new twelve-room, frame
							priest's house was erected for $3,000, and the house-warming took place on October 3,
							1896. In 1898, the school was damaged by fire, but the loss was fully covered by
							insurance, and a second story with two rooms was added.</p>

						<p>The corner-stone of the new church was laid on October 8, 1899, by the Very Rev. J.
							H. Guendling, Administrator of the diocese. The basement has an elevation of twelve
							feet. The building was enclosed in 1900, and on July 14, 1901, the new church was
							solemnly dedicated by Bishop Alerding. The church is built of brick and Bedford stone,
							in the Romanesque style of architecture. It is 138x56 feet, one of the towers having
							an elevation of 138 feet, the other 101 feet. The interior elevation is forty-one
							feet. It is heated by steam and has a $3,500 organ.</p>

						<p>In order to gain more school-room, the old church building was converted into a
							school, and the Sisters' house was enlarged, at a cost of $1,500, in 1901. Large
							sized, full relief Stations of the Cross costing $1,500 were secured, in 1902: a
							Sacred Heart altar and baptismal font in 1903, for $300: and the basement of the
							church was paved with cement, for $600.</p>

						<p>In 1905, a livery stable across the street from the church property was bought for
							$3,500, and shortly after, a house and lot adjoining the church property on the west,
							for $600. A creek north of the church property, which had been a source <pb
								id="VAB8203-362" n="362"/> of annoyance to the parish, received a retaining wall,
							280 feet long, at a cost of $1,500, paid jointly by the city and the parish. The
							church grounds were low and swampy, and it took 10,000 yards of earth, to put the lots
							in proper condition, at an expense of $1,000. Three hundred and fifty feet of cement
							sidewalk, ten feet wide, cost $800, in 1906. The church grounds have a frontage of 350
							feet, with a depth of 228 feet. There is a debt of $6,700 on the church property.</p>

						<p>Seven Sisters of St. Joseph teach the eight grades and a course of high school. The
							school has an attendance of 264 pupils. There are two school buildings, each
							containing four rooms, furnishing ample accommodations: but the intention is to erect
							a school building, to harmonize with the church, in the not distant future.</p>

						<p>St. Joseph's Church has the Rosary Society for the Married Ladies; the Young Men and
							the Young Ladies' Sodality, for the young people; the Holy Name Society, for the
							Married Men; the Society of the Children of Mary, and of the Infant Jesus for the
							children. The Apostleship of Prayer was established, in 1894. The Catholic Benevolent
							Legion since 1893, the Ancient Order of Hibernians since 1898, the Catholic Order of
							Foresters since 1900, the Knights of Columbus since 1903, the Ladies Auxiliary of the
							Ancient Order of Hibernians since 1898 and the Ladies Catholic Benevolent Association
							since 1903. The aggregate membership of these organizations is 1148. These societies
							have commodious and well furnished quarters, with a reading room and elegant
							apartments for innocent recreation. One young man has entered the Brotherhood of Mary,
							two young men are at present theological students, and four girls have become Sisters

							CHURCH.<lb/> 1881.</head>

						<p>North Judson dates its beginning to 1859, when the P. C. C. &amp; St. L. railroad was
							built. Not, however, until 1871 were any Catholics to be found here. In this year, and
							the year <pb id="VAB8203-363" n="363"/> following, we find only two Catholic families.
							The progress of Catholicity was slow, and it was not until the year 1881, that an
							effort was made by the Catholics to erect a place of worship. Prior to this, the
							Fathers of the Most Precious Blood visited the few Catholic families infrequently,
							celebrating Mass, most probably, in a building situated on East Lane street, North
							Judson's first hotel. The present site was donated by Louis and Jacob Keller.</p>

						<p>In the year 1874, the migration of Bohemian families to Railroad and Wayne townships
							began. Some eight or ten years later, the Bohemian population increased, and today
							this section has a larger percentage of Bohemians than any other of the State. At the
							time of the building of the church, in 1881, a list shows that the Catholics numbered
							about twenty-four families, with the Rev. George Fleisch, C. PP. S., their visiting
							pastor. Irregular visits were made by the Fathers of the Most Precious Blood, of whom
							the best remembered, by the members of the parish, are the Rev. John Frericks and Rev.
							Alphonse Grussi. Under the administration of the latter, the congregation came into
							possession of a site for a cemetery, donated by Jacob Jachim. In 1884, Father
							Frericks, C. PP. S., dedicated the new cemetery. In 1885,. the Rev. Dominic Shunk, C.
							PP. S., residing at San Pierre, attended to North Judson. He was succeeded by the Rev.
							Casimir Kobylinski, in the year 1891, who was the first resident pastor. Father
							Kobylinski remained for two years until the appointment of his successor in the person
							of the Rev. John F. Kubacki. In July 1894, Father Dominic again attended to the
							spiritual wants of the parish. During the pastorate of Father Kobylinski, the site of
							the present rectory was secured.</p>

						<p>In 1896, Father Kubacki was succeeded by Rev. Peter A. Kahellek, who in return was
							succeeded by Rev. Joseph Bolka, in July 1899. On November 25, 1904, Father Bolka was
							transferred to East Chicago and the Rev. Felix Thomas Seroczynski, given charge.. The
							Rev. C. F. Keyser has been the pastor since June 8, 1907. North Judson has ninety-six
							Catholic families, numbering 438 souls. The church-property is free from all
							indebtedness. The League of the Sacred Heart has a membership of 100. San Pierre is a

							when the orphans were removed to Lafayette and to Fort Wayne. In July 1882, Rev. M.
							Zumbuelte began to build the present brick church at Rensselaer, 37x80 feet, at a cost
							of about $5,000. It was completed and dedicated, on January 18, 1885. At that time the
							number of souls was about 150. Six lots of the present church grounds were bought by
							Bishop Luers. Rev. George L. Willard was pastor, from March to October 1888. It was in
							October of 1888, that the Bishop gave the Fathers C. PP. S., charge of St. Augustine's
							Congregation, at Rensselaer, and the first of these Fathers appointed pastor was Rev.
							Anthony Dick, C. PP. S., who had charge until July, 1891. After him came Rev.
							Stanislaus Neiberg, C. PP. S., who gave the church new windows, new altars, a
							beautiful chandelier and frescoed the interior, paying also a debt of $600, which
							still rested on the church. While pastor of St. Augustine's, Father Neiberg was also
							professor at St. Joseph's College. Rev. Francis Schalk, C. PP. S., was the pastor from
							September 1896 till February 1897. He was succeeded by Rev. Bernard Dickmann, C. PP.
							S., who on account of sickness went south. After him came Rev. Edward Jakob, C. PP.
							S., who remained until June 1899. Rev. Charles Notheis, C. PP. S., was pastor for
							three months only, from June till September 1899. Rev. Thomas Meyer, C. PP. S., has
							been the pastor of St. Augustine's Church, since September 1899.</p>

						<p>During Father Meyer's pastorate a two-story, brick school-house was built, and was

							CHURCH.<lb/> 1883.</head>

						<p>It appears, that Rev. John Ryan, residing at Lagro, visited Hartford City in the year
							1856. He celebrated Mass, as did those priests who came after him up to the year 1883,
							in the homes of Daniel O'Connell, John Hollisey, Denis Noonan, John McManamon, Jerry
							and Patrick Kirby, Denis Shay, Jerry Cashman, John Collins, John Trant, John Hogan,
							Thomas Maxwell and John Dougherty. After Father Ryan, came Rev. Lawrence Lamoor, Rev.
							Martin Noll, Rev. William Schmidt, Rev. P. M. Frawley, Rev. Michael F. Kelly, Rev.
							James F. Twigg, Rev. Anthony Strueder and Rev. John Grogan. These priests were
							visiting, not resident pastors.</p>

						<p>Father Grogan, who attended Hartford City twice a month, built the first church, in
							1883. It was a plain frame building, but it answered the needs of the poor and small
							congregation at that time. The discovery of natural gas brought many manufacturing
							interests to Hartford City, and also increased the number of Catholics there. Bishop
							Rademacher sent Rev. Charles Dhe to Hartford City, as its first resident pastor, in
							March 1894. He proceeded at once to build a pastoral residence. The frame church was
							in a delapidated condition and stood in need of repairs and improvements. But it soon
							became apparent, that a new church must be built to accommodate the congregation. In
							the fall of 1897 ground was broken for the foundation, and on April 24, 1898 the new
							church was dedicated, in the presence of several thousand visitors from the
							surrounding country. Pontifical Mass was celebrated by Bishop Rademacher, Rev. J. F.
							Delaney, of Fort Wayne, preaching the sermon. In the afternoon, the <pb
								id="VAB8203-366" n="366"/> Bishop administered the sacrament of confirmation to
							forty-two persons.</p>

						<p>The present St. John's Church is a brick structure, of Gothic architecture, the spire
							rising to a height of 100 feet. The seating capacity is 350. The ground, on which the
							church and the other buildings stand, comprises one-half of a block. On this ground
							stand St. John's Church, the Holy Family School, the pastoral residence and the
							Sisters' house. The school was erected in 1904 costing, inclusive of furnishings,
							$8,000. It is a two-story building, 60x60 feet, with four school-rooms and will
							accommodate 160 children. Three Sisters of Providence have charge of the school,
							attended by 118 children, and the usual eight grades are being taught. They reside in
							the house erected by Father Dhe, upon his arrival in Hartford City, in 1894. The
							present pastoral residence was erected, by Father Dhe, in 1904, costing, everything
							included, $6,000.</p>

						<p>St. John's has ninety-two families, numbering 436 souls. The amount of indebtedness
							on the church property at the present time is $7,800.</p>

						<p>Rev. Charles Dhe had charge of Hartford City and its mission, from March 1894 to July
							11, 1906, since which date the Rev. John F. Noll is the resident pastor. Since his

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">SOUTH BEND.</hi><lb/> ST. MARY'S CHURCH.<lb/>
							1883.</head>

						<p>There were some German Catholic families living in South Bend, as early as 1850. They
							attended Mass at Notre Dame, and later at St. Joseph's Church on the East side of St.
							Joseph's <pb id="VAB8203-367" n="367"/> river. When St. Patrick's Church was built on
							West Division street, the Germans contributed towards it and worshipped there. The
							Rev. Joseph Carrier, C. S. C., was probably the first priest to preach to the German
							Catholics in their mother tongue, at St. Patrick's Church. Several attempts were made,
							at different times, to organize and form a German parish, but for various reasons
							these efforts were unsuccessful. While attending St. Patrick's Church, the German
							Catholics organized the St. John's Benevolent Society, on March 25, 1879. This society
							induced Bishop Dwenger, to secure for the German Catholics the services of Rev. Paul
							Kolopp, C. S. C., a newly ordained priest, who, having charge of the German Catholic
							element, resided with the pastor of St. Patrick's Church. He came as such in June
							1880, but remained only for a short time.</p>

						<p>At last, in February 1882, the Rev. Peter Johannes, C. S. C., was appointed the first
							regular pastor for the Germans in South Bend. The ground, on which St. Mary's Church
							stands, measures 99x221 feet, and was bought in July 1882, for the sum of $2,100. On
							August 22, 1883, the corner-stone was laid for the new church, which was given the
							name of the Assumption Church. The first services were held in it on Christmas, 1883,
							and Bishop Dwenger solemnly dedicated it, on May 11, 1884. It is a plain frame
							structure, 76x36 feet, with a sacristy on the rear and cost about $4,500. The cupola
							on the church has a small bell in it, but an extra bell tower was erected, near the
							sacristy, for a large bell donated by George Dotterwick. The congregation, at this
							time, consisted of about fifty families.</p>

						<p>A school was opened in the sacristy of the church, in January 1884, with an
							attendance of twenty-seven children, The accommodations being insufficient a one-story
							frame building, 25x50 feet, was erected and ready for use by November, 1884. In the
							summer of 1891, another story was added to this building, thus affording four
							class-rooms, with accommodations for about 240 children. Sisters of the Holy Cross
							have been teaching the school, from the beginning.</p>

						<p>In the mean time, the church had been fitted up with three Gothic altars, different
							statues, pews and a small gallery with a reed organ. A Redemptorist Father gave the
							first mission in this church in September, 1886. One night, during <pb
								id="VAB8203-368" n="368"/> the mission, a dreadful hail storm swept over South Bend,
							and destroyed every window on the north side of St. Mary's Church; and the rain fell
							in such torrents, that the people could not leave the church, till two o'clock in the
							morning. Since 1888, a number of Hungarians settled in South Bend, and Father Johannes
							took special interest in their spiritual welfare, until a parish of their own was
							organized.</p>

						<p>Up to August 1895, Father Johannes resided with the pastor of St. Patrick's Church;
							but it was then determined to purchase the house and lot adjoining St. Mary's Church,
							for a pastoral residence. The lot measures 50x221 feet, the house is a one-story frame
							building, with six rooms and both cost $3,000. A kitchen and bath-room have been added
							since. In the course of time, a hot air furnace was put in the church, sewer
							connections were made for the house and school, and the streets improved. Extensive
							improvements however were made in 1903, in preparation for the Silver Jubilee of
							Father Johannes; stained glass windows, two large chandeliers, a new pipe organ,
							redecoration of the church, painting of all the buildings, interior renovation of the
							parochial residence-- all this was done and paid for.</p>

						<p>The Silver Jubilee of the beloved pastor took place on October 12, 1903, and it was a
							great day ever memorable in the history of the parish. But Providence abruptly
							terminated the useful life of Father Johannes, for on the night of October 27, 1904,
							having suffered a stroke of apoplexy, he was found dead in his bed in the morning. His
							successor, Rev. J. M. Scherer, C. S. C., took charge of St. Mary's Church on All
							Saints day 1904, and has continued to be its pastor to the present time. He found the
							congregation indebted, to the amount of $2,600. He found also that many repairs had to
							be made necessitating an outlay of $300, leaving a balance at the end of 1905 of less
							than $2,000 indebtedness. In 1906 the gallery of the church was enlarged, to
							accommodate the children. The seating capacity of the church is 425. The present debt
							on the church property is $1,700. The number of souls is about 800, or 190

						<p>The emigration of Polish Catholic settlers in Terre Coupee, and the surrounding
							country, began in about 1870, in consequence of Russian and Prussian persecution in
							Poland. As a station Terre Coupee was visited by Rev. Valentine Czyzewski, C. S. C:,
							Rev. F. X. Szulak, S. J., and Rev. Ludwig Madgzicki, C. R., celebrating Mass in the
							woods and in log cabins.</p>

						<p>The first church was a small frame structure, 60x30 feet, built by Father Czyzewski
							in 1884, at a cost of $1,800. As a mission, Terre Coupee was attended once a month by
							priests residing, either at Notre Dame, or South Bend. The names of Rev. Alexander
							Kirsch, C. S. C., Michael Lauth, C. S. C., Rev. V. Czyzewski, C. S. C., appear on the
							records. The first resident pastor of Terre Coupee was Rev. W. Zborowski, during whose
							pastorate, in 1888, one and a half acres of ground were purchased for $185.50. He was
							succeeded by Rev. George Kolesinski from January 1894 until May 1, 1901, when Rev.
							Alexander Buechler took charge and is the pastor at the present time. During his
							pastorate, in 1903, the present church was commenced and was dedicated, in 1906. It is
							built in the Gothic style of architecture, has Gothic altars, confessional, pulpit,
							altar-railing and pews. The cost of the church was a little less than $23,000. The
							seating capacity is 460.</p>

						<p>The old church was used also as a school for fifteen years, the Blessed Sacrament
							being removed to the sacristy during school hours. Since the erection of the new
							church, the old church is used for school purposes exclusively. When Terre <pb
								id="VAB8203-370" n="370"/> Coupee was a mission, Brothers of the Holy Cross taught
							the school. At present one lay-teacher has charge of seventy-three pupils.</p>

						<p>The priest's house was built in 1888, by Father Zborowski and has been improved by
							Father Buechler, by the installation of an electric light plant, which gives light
							also to the church and school. The church property has a debt of $8,000. The
							congregation numbers about 538 souls, or 139 families.</p>

						<p>St. Stanislaus' Parish has the St. Stanislaus Kostka's Society, for the Men, since
							1901; the Sacred Heart League, since 1890, for the Married Women, and the Young
							Ladies' Sodality, since 1902; with an aggregate membership of 136. The mission Rolling
							Prairie is attended from Terre Coupee every Sunday.</p>

							1887.</head>

						<p>The Church of the Most Precious Blood, in Wanatah, was established in the year 1887.
							The number of souls at that time was about thirty families, four-fifths German and
							one-fifth Irish. Prior to 1887, these Catholics were members of St. Martin's Church,
							at Schimmels. Rev. Dominic Shunk, C. PP. S., was made the first pastor in June, 1887,
							and remained until February 1897. The present church was built by him, and dedicated
							by Bishop Dwenger on November 12, 1887. It is a frame structure, 35x80 feet, with a
							seating capacity of about 350. It was built at an outlay of $6,000. In 1888, Father
							Shunk built a large frame school-house, with which a residence for the Sisters was
							connected, at a cost of $2,500. The Sisters, C. PP. S., had charge of the school up to
							June 1904, when the school was discontinued, the attendance of pupils at the time
							being only about sixteen. In the same year, Father Shunk built the priest's house, for
							$1,800. During Father Shunk's pastorate, Schimmels, SanPierre, Walkerton, Westville,
							Hamlet, Wheatfield, North Judson were missions and Knox a station, attended from
							Wanatah.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-371" n="371"/>

						<p>The second pastor was Rev. Edward Jakob, C. PP. S., having charge also of Schimmels,
							Walkerton, and Hamlet. The third pastor was Rev. Raymond Vernimont, C. PP. S., from
							September 22, 1897 to September 8, 1898, having charge of the same missions. On
							September 8, 1898, Bishop Rademacher appointed Rev. Adam M. Buchheit pastor at
							Wanatah, with Schimmels, Walkerton and Hamlet for missions. He remained until November
							21, 1906, being transferred to St. John, in Lake county. Rev. John Rech had charge of
							Wanatah and its mission Schimmels, till June 8, 1907, when Rev. John Oberholz was
							appointed pastor.</p>

						<p>Until 1887, Rev. Michael O'Reilly of Valpairaso said Mass once a month, on week days,
							at Wanatah in Patrick Lyons' house for the Irish Catholics living at Wanatah.</p>

						<p>The church grounds comprise forty-three and a half acres. Two acres of this were
							donated by the Hon. M. Tucker a non-Catholic, on which to build a church, but on the
							day of the dedication of the church, November 12, 1887, the same generous gentleman
							donated the other forty and a half acres. The lot opposite the church, used for a
							hitching place, was donated by Roman Gruse, a member of the congregation. David Condon
							gave $300 for the erection of a school. The debt at present is $2,250. The number of
							families is forty-two, aggregating 194 souls.</p>

						<p>The Church Societies are: the Apostleship of Prayer, established 1905; the Young
							Ladies' Sodality of the Immaculate Conception, March 13, 1905; the Christian Mothers',
							October 1901; and the Archconfraternity of the Most Precious Blood, with a membership
							of 154, October 27, 1901. Six girls of the parish became members of three different
							sister-hoods.</p>

							1890.</head>

						<p>In 1890, Rev. U. Raszkiewicz, of Otis, assisted by an active committee of eight,
							undertook the task of forming the St. Casimir's Congregation, which consists
							exclusively of Polish Catholics. At that time it was composed of about fifty families
							and a few single persons. Six lots were bought at $300 each, and two lots were
							donated. A frame building of 90x46 feet, was erected at a cost of $10,000. This
							building was to serve the purposes of church, school and priest's residence. The first
							resident pastor was Rev. C. Kobylinski, now of St. Paul, Minnesota, under whose
							pastoral administration the debt on the church property was reduced to $800.</p>

						<p>The present pastor, Rev. P. A. Kahellek took charge of the congregation on July 2,
							1897. He paid off the remaining debt, and made many necessary improvements. St.
							Casimir's enjoys the distinction of having the first pipe organ of any church in
							Hammond. The main altar was remodeled, two side altars were added, as well as
							confessional and other ornaments of the sanctuary, at a cost of $2,000. Father
							Kahellek also bought an additional lot for $300. The long benches were replaced by
							modern school desks, and the necessary school <pb id="VAB8203-373" n="373"/> supplies
							furnished. An additional school-room was prepared, and the eighty children were taught
							by two female lay-teachers until 1901, when the Sisters of St. Francis of Lafayette
							took charge. At the present time the attendance is 137, taught by three Sisters. The
							Sisters reside in the rooms formerly occupied by the pastor.</p>

						<p>The pastoral residence, a commodious brick building, was erected in 1901, at a cost
							of $3,000. In 1905, the church was frescoed. The debt on the church property is
							$2,400. St. Casimir's Parish has 114 families, or 597 souls. The societies are: St.
							Joseph's Society for married men, thirty-two members; the Rosary Society for married
							women, fifteen members; St. Aloysius' Society for single men, nineteen members; the
							Rosary Society for single women, fifteen members; the Guardian Angels' Society for

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">EAST CHICAGO.</hi><lb/> ST. MARY'S CHURCH.<lb/>
							1890.</head>

						<p>East Chicago was founded in the year 1889. The Rev. H. M. Plaster, of St. Joseph's
							Church at Hammond, offered the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, for the first time in East
							Chicago, in the Todd Opera House and continued to do so until the church was
							completed, in the fall of 1890. At that time East Chicago had from thirty-five to
							forty Catholic families. The Land Company donated six lots, and the parish bought
							three more for $900, and in the year 1902 the Rev George Lauer bought five additional
							lots, at a cost of $2,000, which gives the church property a frontage on three
							streets, Forsyth Avenue, One Hundred Forty-Fourth street, and Magoun Avenue.</p>

						<p>A frame church was built and completed in the fall of the year 1890. The architecture
							is Gothic and the building with its furnishings cost $3,500. The condition of the
							parish and church, as we find it in 1890, continued practically for ten years, owing
							to the small number of people who belonged to the parish. The priests who had charge
							of it during this time were: Rev. H. M. Plaster 1890, from Hammond; Rev. John Tremmel,
							assistant, attended a short time; Rev. F. G. Lentz, attended four months till January
							26, 1891; Rev. M. J. Byrne, <pb id="VAB8203-374" n="374"/> till 1894 from Whiting;
							Rev. F. Koslowski, from 1894 till 1898, from Hammond; Rev. H. C. Kappel, assistant at
							Hammond, attended from the fall of 1898 till March 1899; Rev. George Lauer, pastor
							since March 1899.</p>

						<p>When Father Lauer took charge, he found the property in a dilapidated condition, with
							a debt of $2,700. He made the necessary repairs and added a sanctuary with two
							sacristies to the church, increasing the seating capacity to 256. The whole interior
							of the church was furnished and decorated, adding two new side altars. In 1901, Father
							Lauer built a two-story frame school-house, with four rooms, to accommodate 200
							children, at a cost of $3,200. The Sisters of Providence of St. Mary-of-the-Woods have
							charge and the usual grades are taught. The first priest's house, a one-story
							eight-room frame building, erected in 1899 for $2,000, is now occupied by the Sisters.
							The house, occupied at present by the pastor, is a substantial and commodious
							two-story building, erected in 1902, at an expense of $5,550.</p>

						<p>The debt on the church property is $10,800. The number of souls is 550, consisting of
							122 families, and the number of children, attending school, is 220, taught by four
							Sisters of Providence.</p>

						<p>St. Mary's Parish has the Young Ladies' Sodality, organized in 1899; the Rosary
							Society, in 1900; the Purgatorian Society, 1901; the Sacred Heart League, in 1902; the
							Catholic Order of Foresters, in 1899; the Ancient Order of Hibernians, 1902, and the
							L. A. O. H., in 1904; the Holy Angels' Sodality; the Women Catholic Order of

							1890.</head>

						<p>In the year 1886, a school was opened in what was known as "The Bond Building." It
							was established for children, who, on account of the distance, could not attend the
							Cathedral School. The opening of this school of two rooms may be considered the
							beginning of St. Patrick's parish.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-375" n="375"/>

						<p>In 1889 Bishop Dwenger bought four lots on Fairfield avenue, from Peter Owens, whose
							dwelling house was converted into a school of four rooms. In September, of the same
							year, the pupils were transferred from "The Bond Building" to these new quarters,
							henceforth known as "St. Patrick's School." In October, 1889, Bishop Dwenger formed
							the new congregation of St. Patrick's, and gave them the Rev. Thomas M. O'Leary, as
							pastor.</p>

						<p>Bishop Dwenger was prevailed upon to locate the new church where it now stands, but,
							before the lots could be secured, Father O'Leary died within three weeks after his
							appointment. A month later Bishop Dwenger donated the property on Fairfield avenue to
							the new congregation and appointed the Rev. Joseph F. Delaney pastor, to succeed
							Father O'Leary.</p>

						<p>Four lots of the present site had been secured in the mean time, and Father Delaney
							at once purchased the two remaining lots, thus completing the half square fronting on
							Dewald street. In 1905 Father Delaney secured the seventh lot opposite the church.</p>

						<p>The corner-stone of the new St. Patrick's Church was laid on May 20, 1890, by Bishop
							Dwenger, and on November 22, 1891, the church was dedicated by the Vicar General,
							Father Brammer. The church is of Gothic design, 167 feet in length, with a frontage of
							ninety-four feet. The spire rises to a height of 185 feet. The interior decorations
							are beautiful, the furnishings complete in every detail, and the seating capacity is
							800. The total cost, including furnishings, was $59,000.</p>

						<p>The school, with nine large well equipped school-rooms, and an assembly hall, was
							built in 1891. The building is 85x72 feet and affords room for more than 500 pupils.
							The cost was $14,500. Improvements were made on it in 1887, and again in 1890,
							aggregating an additional cost of $2,000. The Sisters of Providence, from St.
							Mary-of-the-Woods, have had charge of the school from the beginning. The number of
							teachers has increased from six to sixteen, and the number of pupils from 175 to 480.
							Eight grades are taught in the parochial school; but in 1901, at a cost of $14,000,
							Father Delaney erected St. Catharine's Academy, adjoining the school, wherein <pb
								id="VAB8203-376" n="376"/> a High-school and a Commercial Course for the pupils,
							desiring to fit themselves for a business career, are being conducted.</p>

						<p>The original parochial residence, erected in 1891 at a cost of $3,800, having become
							too small, was remodeled and enlarged, in 1906, at a cost of $11,000. Th lot opposite
							the church, on Harrison street, will at a later date have on it a Parish Hall. The
							church property is out of debt, and has a cash balance of $3,000 in the treasury.</p>

						<p>St. Patrick's Church has Sodalities for married men, with 223 members, for young men,
							with 206 members, and for boys, with ninety-two members; and it has Sodalities for
							young women, with 268 members, and for girls, with 306 members, together with a Living
							Rosary Society, with 430 members, and the Guardian Angel Society, with 306 members.
							Benevolent organizations of the parish are: St. Joseph's Society, Indiana League, with
							thirty-seven members, the Ladies' Catholic Benevolent Association, with ninety
							members, and the Ladies' Auxiliary A. O. H. with seventy-three members. The above
							Sodalities and Church Societies, aside from the spiritual purposes for which they were
							organized, are also a great help to the pastor in the work of up-building the
							parish.</p>

						<p>The parish has 476 families. The number of souls is 2064. Six boys of the parish have
							become priests, and twenty-three girls have entered religious communities. George P.
							Gordon deserves special mention since through his devotedness and energy all the
							original church property of St. Patrick's was acquired.</p>

						<p>The assistant priests at St. Patrick's Church, in the order given, were: Revs. Edward
							F. Barrett, Frederick Dandurand, Patrick J. Crawley, Thomas A. Mungovan, Rev. Edward
							J. Mungovan, and Rev. James Durham, since June 8, 1907.</p>

						<p>The Rev. M. J. Byrne visited Whiting, from East Chicago, for the first time on
							February 1, 1891. He found there a congregation of about twenty families, and some 100
							single men, <pb id="VAB8203-377" n="377"/> clamoring for a church. Prior to this, Rev.
							F. H. Joseph Kroll had visited Whiting, and had started a subscription list with about
							fifty names on it, and had secured five lots on Center street, one of them donated by
							Colonel Forsyth and the other four bought for $400 each. Father Byrne bought five
							additional lots, at the same price. Ground for the new church was broken on March 19,
							1891. The church was 50x35 feet. It received a Main Altar and two side Altars, and was
							ready for dedication, which took place on May 24, 1891, the Vicar General, Father
							Brammer, officiating. Before Whiting had a church, Father Kroll, from Chesterton, had
							celebrated Mass for the first time in a pavilion, and after that in a school-house in
							Oklahoma, and in a hall over Green's saloon. In September, 1891, Father Byrne erected
							the new Orient Hall, which was destroyed by fire on March 31, 1897, the pastor
							settling with the insurance company for $762. Statues of the Blessed Virgin and St.
							Joseph were provided in 1891, and in September, 1892, the Vicar General, Father
							Brammer, blessed a 1000 pound bell, naming it St. Matthias. Confirmation was
							administered for the first time in Whiting by Bishop Rademacher of Nashville, on
							October 16, 1892.</p>

						<p>The parochial school was opened on September 3, 1895, in the old Orient Hall which
							had in it two school-rooms. The Sisters of Providence of St. Mary-of-the-Woods had
							charge. The attendance on the first day was 150 children. After the destruction of the
							Orient Hall by fire in 1897, Father Byrne built a two-story, brick school-house, with
							three large school-rooms on the first floor, and a large hall on the second. At the
							same time a two-story frame building was erected for the Sisters' dwelling. And, also
							was built, a two-story brick structure with all the modern improvements, for a
							pastoral residence. Father Byrne was removed from Whiting, in August 1898, and was
							succeeded by Rev. Charles Thiele. The new pastor found Whiting to consist of a
							floating population; and the church property was indebted to the amount of $9,265.
							During his pastorate, he built an addition to the church, bought ten new lots for a
							church site costing $2,500, and reduced the debt to $6,500. On July 1, 1905, Father
							Thiele was succeeded by Rev. John B. Berg.</p>

						<p>Whiting has 165 Catholic families, numbering 782 souls. <pb id="VAB8203-378" n="378"

							1896.</head>

						<p>In the year 1870 Alexandria was a village of 300 inhabitants, and, of these, eight
							souls were Catholic, of Irish descent. The construction of two railroads, crossing at
							Alexandria, increased the number of Catholics to about thirty. At this time, Rev. John
							B. Crawley, located at Anderson, paid his first visit to this village. The first Mass
							was celebrated by him here, in an old log house, on East Washington street. With
							nothing but the conveyances of those days at his disposal, and the use of even these
							very limited on account of the slender support that could be given priests in those
							days, the trips from Anderson to Alexandria entailed many hardships. But Father
							Crawley continued his visits at intervals of two or three months, until about 1882. By
							this time, railroad facilities had increased to such an extent, that access to
							Anderson was made much easier, and Father Crawley's work in the immediate vicinity of
							Anderson so much more onerous, that he discontinued his visits to Alexandria. The
							discovery of natural gas, in 1891, brought various manufacturing industries to
							Alexandria, and these brought with them a new influx of Catholics. Rev. B. Biegel,
							located at Elwood, visited Alexandria in his pastoral capacity, for the first time, in
							the spring of 1892, celebrating Mass in a private house. After that services were
							held, once a month on Sunday, in the Commercial Hall, which was soon changed to
							"Tammany Hall," until services could be held in their own church. Bad weather and the
							hardships of a ten mile drive did not prevent Father Biegel from making the stated
							visits. The congregation, at that time, numbered about fifty families. Funds were
							continually <pb id="VAB8203-381" n="381"/> collected to secure church accommodations.
							Through the kindly influence of W. C. Depauw, over the various land companies, a site
							of five lots was secured on the corner of Belmont avenue and Madison street, in April,
							1893. The congregation having increased to sixty-five families, it was deemed
							necessary that a pastor should be located at Alexandria. On June 8, 1893, Rev. John B.
							Berg was appointed pastor at Alexandria, but, for the time being, resided at Elwood.
							The sum of $600 had been collected by Father Biegel, and on July 9, 1893, Father Berg
							contracted for the foundation of the new structure, for the sum of $950. The
							foundation having been completed, the panic of 1893 came upon the country, and
							affected Alexandria to such an extent, that the work of continuing the building was
							out of the question. Bishop Rademacher deemed it expedient, in October 1893, to assign
							Father Berg to another field of labor.</p>

						<p>Father Biegel took up the work again, visiting Alexandria regularly, until December
							1895, when Bishop Rademacher deemed it advisable to give Alexandria a pastor. Rev.
							Joachim Baker was appointed, and held services for the first time on January 12, 1896,
							in Tammany Hall. He began, at once, to reside at Alexandria in a rented house, and in
							this house a chapel was arranged for the daily Mass. A small altar was purchased, and
							the crate, in which it had been shipped, was converted into a vestment case; and a few
							small benches were adapted to the room. In this chapel regular services were held, the
							sacraments administered and the Blessed Sacrament kept until the church was
							completed.</p>

						<p>In June, 1896, Father Baker saw his way clear for giving the contract for a two-story
							brick structure, 35x65 feet, with a wing, for a consideration of $7,000. The second
							floor, of this building, was to be used for church purposes, whilst a part of the
							first floor was arranged for school-rooms, and the other part for the Sisters'
							residence. The building, when completed, was placed under the patronage of the Blessed
							Mother of God. The first services were held, in the new building, on the 6th day of
							December. The Rev. A. B. Oechtering of Mishawaka presented the new St. Mary's parish
							with the pews of his old St. Joseph's Church, together with the Stations of the
							Cross.</p>

						<p>Until the opening of the school, Father Baker occupied <pb id="VAB8203-382" n="382"/>
							the resident part of the building. Three School Sisters of Notre Dame accepted the
							charge of the school, and it was opened on September 13, 1897, with an enrollment of
							eighty pupils. At the end of the first school year, however, 120 children were in
							attendance. On September 19th, Bishop Rademacher visited Alexandria, to dedicate the
							new building, and to administer the sacrament of Confirmation.</p>

						<p>Upon the arrival of the Sisters, Father Baker again lived in a rented house. In
							September, 1898, the priest's house was begun and completed in April, 1899, at a cost
							of $4,000. Five additional lots, directly north of the present site, were purchased in
							the fall of 1899. Three years had elapsed, and the school accommodations were found to
							be inadequate, and accordingly a two-story brick addition, 48x48 feet, at a cost of
							$6,000, was erected in the spring of 1900. The school building, at present, has five
							school-rooms and an attendance of 209 pupils. The eight grades are taught, by six
							Sisters.</p>

						<p>The church property covers a half block, and the grounds are being well cared for, by
							ornamentations, such as trees, shrubbery, flowers and lawn. The church property has a
							debt of $8,862 on it. The Rosary and Altar Societies, aside from their spiritual
							purpose, have supplied the church with vestments and other articles. The Sodality of
							the Blessed Virgin for young women, and the Children of Mary, have provided a library;
							whilst the St. Aloysius' Society for young men has done equally good service. The St.
							Cecilia's Men Choir is making earnest efforts to comply with the Holy Father's "Motu
							Proprio," on Church Music. St. Mary's Congregation numbers 210 families, with 1024
							souls.</p>

						<p>In 1853, Dunkirk was called Quincy. In 1869, it began to be visited by priests from
							Union City and Portland. From 1869 till 1896 Dunkirk was a station, visited by the
							following priests: Rev. Lawrence Lamoor, from 1869 till 1870, from Union City; Rev.
							John Bleckmann, from May 1870 for nine months, assistant at Union City; Rev. Frederick
							Von Schwedler, <pb id="VAB8203-383" n="383"/> from 1871 to 1872, from Union City; Rev.
							Martin F. Noll, from 1872 to 1875, from Union City; Rev. Jeremiah Quinlan, from 1875
							till 1888, from Union City; Rev. Joachim Baker, from 1888 till 1891, from Portland;
							Rev. Anthony J. Strueder, from October 1891 till October 25, 1894, from Portland; Rev.
							Charles Dhe, from 1894 till March 1900, from Hartford City; Rev. William S. Hogan,
							from March 1900 till September 7, 1902, was the first resident pastor; and Rev. John
							C. Wakefer is the second resident pastor, since September 7, 1902.</p>

						<p>Father Dhe, for two years when visiting Dunkirk, celebrated Mass in the Opera House.
							The number of souls at that time was about 100. In 1896, the first and present church
							was erected by Father Dhe. Its dimensions are 40x60 feet; it is of brick, on a stone
							foundation, has two steeples, and is constructed after the Gothic style of
							architecture. The cost of the building was $6,000.</p>

						<p>In March of 1900, Dunkirk ceased to be a mission by receiving its first resident
							pastor, in the person of Rev. William S. Hogan. He spent two years and a half here,
							paying off the greater part of the debt. He also had charge of Red Key and Albany. The
							present pastor, Rev. John C. Wakefer, took charge September 7, 1902. His first work
							was to pay off the remaining debt of $1,000. In 1904, the church was frescoed for
							$280, a chandelier and electric lights were put in for $200. Having provided the
							sanctuary and sacristy with many necessaries, including a baptismal font, he bought a
							bell, weighing 1535 pounds, which was blessed September 4, 1906. In October, of the
							same year, he installed a steam heating plant for church and house, costing $1,160,
							put a new roof on the church, repaired the house, put down cement side walks, and
							enclosed the entire church property with a beautiful fence. The seating capacity of
							the church is about 250.</p>

						<p>With the exception of one lot, the church grounds consist of a whole block, on the
							west side of Broad street, in the southeastern part of the town. The fifth lot of
							ground, having on it a two-story house, was bought for $825. This house is the
							priest's residence. The number of souls is 240, consisting of fifty-two families.</p>

						<p>St. Mary's Church has an Altar Society, organized January 1, 1903, with thirty-five
							members, which has charge of <pb id="VAB8203-384" n="384"/> the sanctuary. This
							society secured the money to buy the church bell, the largest and best bell in
							Dunkirk. The Young Ladies' Sodality, organized on December 8, 1906, has twenty-two
							members. The Young Men's Society has nineteen members. The debt on the church property
							is $2,200.</p>

						<p>The pastor at Dunkirk visits the mission, Red Key, on the first Sunday of each

							Casimir Kobylinski and Rev. Peter Kahellek. In 1896 Father Kobylinski secured six
							lots, on Baring avenue and One Hundred and Fiftieth street. The first church, a frame
							structure, 80x30 feet, was erected in the same year, under the supervision of the same
							Father. It was placed under the patronage of St. Michael, the Archangel. The number of
							souls at this time was about 200.</p>

						<p>The present church grounds were secured by Rev. John Kubacki in 1901, having an area
							of one block, 225x296 feet, fronting on Magoun and Forsyth avenues, and One Hundred
							and Fiftieth street. Additional five lots, 25x140 feet each, are located on Forsyth
							avenue. These grounds were secured by Father Kubacki, in 1901, at a cost of about
							$20,000. The church which stood on Baring avenue was removed to its present site,
							after which it was known as St. Stanislaus' Church. Rev. Joseph Bolka took charge in
							November, 1904. At a cost of $1,500 he built an addition, 36x30 feet, to the church.
							The Rosary Society for women and St. Cecilia's choir, in 1907, donated two side
							altars, costing $240. At the present time the church is being frescoed for $300. A
							lot, situated some distance from the church, was donated for the benefit of the
							congregation, by the Bell and Hoffman Land Company.</p>

						<p>The building used for school purposes was erected by Father Kubacki in 1901. It is a
							two-story frame structure, 22x64 feet, and cost about $1,800. It has four school-rooms
								<pb id="VAB8203-385" n="385"/> and can accommodate about 230 children. The parochial
							school is conducted in the six grades, by four Sisters of St. Francis, attended by 238
							pupils. The residence occupied by the Sisters stood on the ground purchased in 1901,
							and is a one-and-a-half-story frame building, which probably cost about $1,000. In
							1905 and 1906 Father Bolka expended an additional $1,000 in repairs and
							improvements.</p>

						<p>The parochial residence also stood on the grounds purchased in 1901. It measures
							22x56 feet, and its probable cost was $2,000. In 1905, Father Bolka improved and
							enlarged the building, at an expense of $2,000. The parish has 280 families, numbering
							1324 souls. The present indebtedness on the church property is $4,500.</p>

						<p>St. Stanislaus' Church has these societies: St. Michael's, for married men, 125

						<p>In the earlier days, the few Belgian families living in South Bend worshipped at St.

							year procured for them the services of Rev. J. Joos, a Belgian priest, from the
							diocese of Detroit. In 1896, the number of Belgian families had increased to fifty and
							the Rev. Henry A. Paanakker, C. S. C., a newly ordained priest, received the
							appointment as pastor of the Belgians, with instructions to organize a Belgian parish.
							He at once bought two lots of ground for $1,800, and on one of them he erected a
							two-story building, with a brick <pb id="VAB8203-387" n="387"/> basement, to serve the
							purposes of both church and school. This building was put up at an expense of $8,000.
							Father Paanakker, in the mean time, occupied one of the 9x12 feet sacristies, for his
							residence. Some time after he bought a two-story frame house, and moved it on the
							other lot for a priest's house, at a cost of $850. The location of the church property
							is in the residence portion of South Bend.</p>

						<p>The school is conducted by lay-teachers, having been taught at one time, for two

						<p>On February 12, 1895, Bishop Rademacher assigned the territory north of the St.
							Mary's river and to the New York, Chicago and St. Louis railway, and west of the Lake
							Shore and Michigan Southern railway, in and near the city of Fort Wayne, to the
							pastoral care of the Society of the Most Precious Blood. October 12, 1897, marks the
							beginning of the new congregation, when the Rev. Frank Nigsch, C. PP. S., entered upon
							the pastoral duties, within the territory mentioned. On the north-west corner of
							Fourth and Barthold streets, nine lots were bought for $2,500; and the additional
							purchase of the feeder, of the old Wabash and Erie canal, gave the church grounds the
							entire length on Fourth street between Barthold and Andrew streets, and 250 feet north
							of Fourth street. About 135 families resided within the parish limits; fifty-five of
							which had hitherto attended the Catherdal, forty-two St. Mary's and about thirty-eight
							St. Paul's. A two-story brick building, to serve the purposes of church and school,
							50x111 feet, at a cost of $9,945, was erected in 1898. The street, sewer and other
							improvements, and the furnishings of the second floor, for church purposes, including
							an organ, necessitated an additional outlay of $6,783.98. The school was opened on
							September 12, 1898, in charge of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood, with an
							attendance of 160 children. The eight grades <pb id="VAB8203-391" n="391"/> of a
							common school education are being taught. The School Society of the Precious Blood,
							organized in the same year, has the support of the school for its principal purpose.
							The same year the Fathers of the Most Precious Blood erected a Missionary House, which
							serves also as a pastoral residence, fronting on Barthold street.</p>

						<p>An assembly hall, 30x80 feet, being a one-story brick structure, furnished with a
							stage and necessary fixtures, was erected in 1902, at a cost of about $3,200. The
							present indebtedness on the church property is $1,832.65.</p>

						<p>In 1898 the School Society, the Rosary Society, the Young Ladies' Sodality and the
							Society of the Holy Infancy, were established; and in 1899 the Young Men's Sodality
							and the Sodality of the Children of Mary, with a total membership of 517.</p>

						<p>One of the boys of the congregation has entered a religious community, and is now
							studying for the priesthood; and one of the girls has become a Sister.</p>

						<p>The Rev. Frank Nigsch, C. PP. S., was the pastor of the congregation until January
							19, 1903, when he was transferred to Ottawa, Ohio. The Rev. Chrysostom Hummer, C. PP.
							S., has been the pastor since January, 1903. He reduced the debt to its present
							figure. The parish has 170 families, with total of 823 souls. The school, taught by
							four Sisters of the Most Precious Blood, has an attendance of 172 pupils. Besides the
							societies mentioned, there are the C. B. L., the C. K. of A., and the Ladies Catholic

							architecture <pb id="VAB8203-392" n="392"/> nor decorations to recommend it, and cost
							about $1,000. This building was enlarged in 1897 for $3,000, and again in 1902, at an

						<p>The Polish Catholics, residing in the north-western section of South Bend, constitute
							the St. Stanislaus' Congregation. <pb id="VAB8203-393" n="393"/> It was called Linden
							Place and Golden Hills. At the time of its organization, the number of families was
							about sixty. The church was erected in 1898. It is in the Gothic style of
							architecture, has a seating capacity of 425, and cost $23,000. St. Stanislaus, B. and
							M., is the patron Saint of the parish. Not the entire church according to the original
							plan was erected but only two-thirds of it, the other third, being the sanctuary is
							still wanting. At first the accommodations were ample, but at the present time it is
							much too small, three masses being necessary to give all the opportunity of hearing
							mass. The Rev. V. Czyzewski, C. S. C., pastor of St. Hedwig's Church, assisted by an
							able committee of lay-men and a willing people, organized St. Stanislaus'
							Congregation, bought the site for $5,000, and built the church.</p>

						<p>For fully three years and a half the pastors of St. Stanislaus' Church resided at St.
							Hedwig's. The Rev. H. Jarzynski, C. S. C., was the first temporary pastor. He resided
							with Father Czyzewski for six months. The present pastor, Rev. Roman A. Marciniak, C.
							S. C., who was appointed in 1900, resided at St. Hedwig's for three years. The
							basement of the church served as dining-room, and at times as bed-room for the pastor.
							In 1903, a commodious pastoral residence was built on the north side of the
							church.</p>

						<p>Although the accommodations in the basement of the church were not what they should
							be, yet a parochial school was conducted there, until 1905. It was in this year that
							the present roomy school-house was erected. At present St. Stanislaus' Church has 282
							families, numbering 1543 souls. The school is conducted by Sisters of the Holy Cross,
							with an attendance of 277 children. The societies are: St. Joseph's, St. Stanislaus'
							and the Holy Rosary, for married men, with 341 members; the Apostleship of Prayer, for
							married women, 154 members; St. Stanislaus', for single men, twenty-eight members;
							Holy Rosary, for single women, forty members; Children of Mary and Holy Angels', for

						<p>It was about 1860, that priests began to visit Fairmount, as a station. The first of
							these priests was Rev. John Ryan, who attended from Lagro, four times a year. After
							him came Rev. Bernard Kroeger, from Peru; Rev. John Kelly, Kokomo; Rev. B. T. Borg,
							Peru; Rev. C. Mougin, Rev. A. J. Strueder, Rev. F. C. Wiechmann, Rev. John Grogan; the
							latter four from, Marion. When visiting Fairmount, they would celebrate Mass at the
							homes of various families. The number of souls in the vicinity of Fairmount, at that
							time, was about 100, mostly Irish. Rev. Frederick Wiechmann visited Fairmount, as a
							station, from Gas City, from April 1894 till August 1898. During the pastorate of Rev.
							Joachim Baker, who attended Fairmount from Alexandria, from August 1898 till September
							1900, the first church was built, being ready for occupancy on September 15, 1899. The
							building was erected at a cost of about $3,000. At this time, the number of souls was
							about 350. The two lots that compose the church grounds, 75x150 feet each, were
							purchased by Father Baker, for $300. St. Cecilia's Church is a frame structure, with
							Gothic features, and is neatly furnished, having stained glass windows. The seating
							capacity of the church is about 350.</p>

						<p>The priest's house was built in 1902 by Rev. Henry C. Kappel, who was the pastor from
							July 14, 1901 to June 30, 1905. It is a frame building containing seven rooms, and
							cost probably $1,400. Owing to the general depreciation of value on real estate in
							Fairmount, the church property, at present, would command no more than $3,000. St.
							Cecilia's Church has three societies: The Rosary Society, for the Married People; the
							St. Aloysius' Society, for Young Men and Boys, and the Children of Mary for the Young
							Women and Girls of the parish. The number of souls, at the present time, is
							ninety-four, constituting twenty families. Fairmount, since it became a mission, has
							had these pastors: Rev. Joachim Baker, from August 1898 to September 1900, from
							Alexandria Rev. L. R. Paquet, from September 2, 1900 till January 1, 1901, residing at

						<p>In the year 1896, Father Czyzewski, anticipating the needs of Polish Catholics in the
							south-western part of South Bend, bought the four lots of ground on West Dunham and
							Webster streets. On September 11, 1898 Rev. Anthony Zubowicz, C. S. C., at the time
							assistant to Father Czyzewski and the director of St. Hedwig's School, was appointed
							the pastor of the new St. Casimir's Congregation. He began at once the erection of a
							building, which was to serve the purposes both of church and school. It is a two-story
							brick building, 65x125 feet, the first story containing six school-rooms and the
							second story having seating capacity of 749, costing $25,000. Whilst this building was
							being erected Father Zubowicz resided at St. Hedwig's. On March 4, 1899, the new
							structure was dedicated by the Very Rev. John Guendling, Administrator of the diocese
							of Fort Wayne.</p>

						<p>On April 11, 1899, Father Zubowicz resigned and was succeeded by Rev. Eligius
							Raczynski, C. S. C. During his pastorate many improvements were made: a beautiful
							organ was secured for $1,300, together with some statuary, and especially the new
							parochial residence of brick, 35x44 feet, which cost over $3,000. Quite suddenly,
							Father Raczynski in the prime of life expired, on June 11, 1902. Two days later,
							Father Zubowicz again took charge of St. Casimir's Church. Up to this time the school
							had been taught by lay men and women, but now it was placed in charge of the Sisters
							of Nazareth, who, six in number, live in a rented house one block from the church, and
							teach 543 children. Five boys of the parish have entered the seminary, and eighteen
							girls the convent. The census of St. Casimir's Congreagtion shows a record of 480
							families, with a total of 2595 souls.</p>

						<pb id="VAB8203-396" n="396"/>

						<p>The societies of the parish are: St. Casimir's, for men, since 1898, with 250

						<p>Until their parish was organized, the Hungarians of South Bend attended St. Patrick's
							Church, and also St. Mary's Church, because many of them spoke German. During this
							time, Rev. Charles Boehm, of Cleveland, and Rev. Robert Paulovits, of Toledo, Ohio,
							paid their country-men in South Bend repeated visits, and ministered to them.</p>

						<p>Rev. Michael J. Biro, C. S. C., shortly after his ordination in February, 1900, was
							appointed pastor of the Hungarian Catholics, and within a short time organized the St.
							Stephen's Congregation. A Methodist chapel, known as the Milburn Memorial Chapel, was
							for sale, and Father Biro negotiated its purchase, on July 3, 1900. The architectural
							style of this church is the Cross-Gothic-Romanesque, of the fifth century. The
							building was in good condition but had to be altered considerably to serve the purpose
							of a Catholic church. Three altars were secured, with statues of the Blessed Virgin,
							St. Joseph and St. Anthony. A choir loft was built and the stations of the Cross were
							erected. The entire church property was inclosed with an ornamental iron fence. All
							this was <pb id="VAB8203-397" n="397"/> done at a cost of $1,450. The original cost
							paid for the property was $14,800.</p>

						<p>Father Biro erected the parochial school in 1900. The building is 45x45 feet, has
							four class-rooms, each of which can accommodate fifty children. Three thousand dollars
							was spent on this building. The school is in charge of three secular teachers, one
							male and two females, who teach six grades. The attendance at the present time is 171.
							The priest's house was part of the first purchase, but Father Biro has spent on it
							$500 in repairs and improvements. The debt on the church property is $7,900.</p>

						<p>When Father Biro took charge in 1900 he found about sixty Hungarian families. At the
							present time there are 321 families, numbering 2166 souls. The seating capacity of the
							church is only 350, and the necessity of building a more commodious church is evident.
							St. Stephen's Congregation has the following societies: The Knights of St. Stephen,
							twenty members; the Holy Rosary, sixty members; the Children of Mary, fifty-six
							members. The Aid Societies are: St. Stephen's forty-five; St. Joseph's, 325; St.

						<p>A room 20x40 feet was partitioned off in the rear of the altar, and served as a

						<p>Rev. Louis de Seille was the first Belgian emigrant to America, who came to St.
							Joseph county to labor and die here, as we have recorded elsewhere. After him came
							other of his countrymen, settling in South Bend and Mishawaka. Rev. August B.
							Oechtering, pastor of St. Joseph's Church, Mishawaka, did all he could to welcome
							these brethern in the faith, and secured for them the services of priests of their own
							nationality, from time to time. Owing to the efforts made by Father Oechtering, the
							Bishop of Ghent sent a newly ordained Belgian priest, to take charge of the Belgian
							Catholics in Mishawaka. It was Rev. Charles L. Stuer, who arrived on September 29,
							1902, and took up his residence with Father Oechtering, as assistant. The death of
							Father Oechtering, at the close of 1902, discouraged the young Belgian priest and he
							concluded to seek another field of labor. Before going, however, he would give the
							Belgians a. mission, to dispose them for their Easter Communion. The attendance during
							this mission <pb id="VAB8203-400" n="400"/> revealed the fact, that the Belgian
							population of Mishawaka was much larger, than had been suspected. In response to the
							visit of a committee, Bishop Alerding visited Mishawaka, in March 1903, when it was
							determined to organize a Belgian parish. In less than three days, over $4,000 were
							subscribed, and in addition, Ivo Talleu donated six lots, and Leo Bultinck donated the
							present priest's house. On May 3, 1903 Bishop Alerding blessed a frame structure,
							85x35 feet, to be used temporarily as a place of worship.</p>

						<p>The corner-stone for St. Bavo's Church was laid, on May 8, 1904, by Bishop
							Meerschaert, Vicar-apostolic of Indian Territory, a Belgian by birth. It was on the
							first day of January, 1905, that the church was solemnly dedicated to the service of
							Almighty God, by Bishop Alerding. The parish has 201 families, numbering 975 souls.
							The amount of debt is $18,500. St. Bavo's has the Sodality of the Children of Mary,
							with twenty-seven members; the Rosary Confraternity, for Married Women, with
							fifty-four members; St. Bavo's Society, for Men, with seventy-seven members.</p>

						<p>In 1906, the building used temporarily for worship, together with an addition built
							to it, was converted into a school of four-rooms. Adjacent to this school building a
							commodious frame residence was erected for the Sisters. The Dominican Sisters have

							till 1879, Rev. Joseph Stephan made San Pierre his headquarters. From the year 1880
							until the fall of 1884 San Pierre was attended by the Franciscan Fathers, from

							current with the people. Priests of the Most Precious Blood Community, from the fall
							of 1884 until July 1885, when Rev. Dominic Shunk, C. PP. S., began to reside at San
							Pierre, attended San Pierre. The first church, already mentioned, was 18x12 feet, but
							in 1877 an addition of 10 feet was made; but, in 1885 Father Shunk planned a new
							church, which was built and ready for services in 1886. The pastor, having completed
							the church, used the old church building for his residence, during a period of eight
							years. In the fall of 1895 Wanatah became Father Shunk's place of residence. From here
							he attended San Pierre, until the fall of 1895, after which date the Rev. John

						<p>In 1836, some German Catholic families located in Hamilton county, about three and a

							Gueguen. When in 1857, the diocese of Fort Wayne was established the priests of
							Indianapolis ceased to visit here.</p>

						<p>The priests who attended Cicero, from 1857 until the <pb id="VAB8203-407" n="407"/>

						<p>In 1863, a church was built in Buscher's Settlement and was dedicated by Bishop
							Luers, in 1864. At the same time, a church was built in Mullen's Settlement, six miles
							northwest from Cicero. The Washington Glass Company, coming to Cicero in 1894, brought
							with it a number of Catholic settlers, who were anxious to have church accommodations.
							At their request, Bishop Rademacher instructed Father Biegel of Elwood to do for them
							what he could. On March 31, 1898, Father Biegel celebrated Mass at Cicero, and through
							his efforts six lots were bought, in August of that year. Father O'Reilly on leaving
							Frankfort had collected $600 for the new church. The corner-stone for the new church
							was laid on September 30, 1900, by Rev. Charles B. Guendling, of Lafayette, and Rev.
							B. Biegel preached the sermon. The church was dedicated by Bishop Alerding, on
							September 29, 1901, and a class of twenty-four was confirmed. The church is 43x72
							feet, with a nine-foot high basement and a brick veneered superstructure, with stained
							glass windows, three altars, fine pews and a baptistry. It has projecting towers and a
							side sacristy; the style of architecture is a modified Gothic. The cost of the

						<p>What has been said about Hartford City, with regard to visiting clergy in the early

							in March 1894, sent Rev. Charles Dhe to Hartford City as its first resident pastor,
							the Bishop gave him charge also of Montpelier, as a mission. By this time, the
							discovery of natural gas and oil had developed Montpelier into a lively and prosperous
							town. Father Dhe began at once to collect funds for a new church, and, on June 4,
							1896, Bishop Rademacher dedicated it. The church is a brick church after the Gothic
							style of architecture, and has two spires, one eighty and the other sixty feet high.
							The seating capacity is 200, and its cost was $5,500. About the year 1900, Father Dhe
							erected a commodious priest's house adjacent to the church. When Father Dhe was
							transferred from Hartford City, the church property at Montpelier was indebted to the

						<p>Rev. Frederick Wiechmann, of Wabash, was given charge of Warsaw in the spring of
							1874. The necessity of a church was apparent, and he at once bought a piece of ground,
							120x136 feet on West Market street, for $800. The corner-stone for the present church
							was laid on June 1, 1876, and the edifice was solemnly dedicated, by Bishop Dwenger,
							on the feast of the Sacred Heart, in 1877. The church is built of brick, 40x96 feet,
							in the Gothic style of architecture, with a spire 100 feet high. It has a seating
							capacity for 300 persons. The cost, including furniture, was $12,000. The number of
							souls at this time was about 120. In the autumn of 1877, Father Wiechmann transferred
							his residence from Wabash to Warsaw, where, until September 1884, he lived in a rented
							house. He was the <pb id="VAB8203-416" n="416"/> first and only resident pastor of
							Warsaw, attending also to Pierceton and Bourbon as missions. When in September 1884,
							Father Wiechmann was transferred to Anderson, the debt at Warsaw still amounted to
							$3,000.</p>

						<p>Rev. A. M. Ellering, who had his residence at Columbia City, was now given charge of
							Warsaw. The debt was too much for the poor people to pay, and with his Bishop's
							permission, Father Ellering took up collections in twenty-five churches, and
							house-to-house collections in twelve parishes, and within two years wiped out the
							entire debt. The proceeds of a successful fair, in 1899, made some necessary
							improvements on the church property possible. The number of souls is eighty-seven,
							consisting of seventeen families. One boy of the mission has become a priest. The
							League of the Sacred Heart has twenty-seven members. Warsaw is a mission, attended
							from Columbia City on the fourth Sunday of every month, and occasionally on week
							days.</p>

						<p>Wheatfield was part of the so-called Indian Ridge, a trail used by the Pottawottamies

							reclaimed by tiling and ditching. The earliest settlers were Germans, from
							Pennsylvania, emigrants originally from Baden, on which account Wheatfield was known
							as "Das Badische Settlement." Without doubt, some of the earlier missionaries came
							through these regions, but the first priest, whose name is on record as having visited
							the scattered farmers around Wheatfield, was Rev. Joseph Stephan who came from San
							Pierre, in 1872. He celebrated Mass on occasion of these visits in the log-house of
							William Grube. For a few years from 1880, Franciscan Fathers from Lafayette attended
							Wheatfield. They said Mass in the Eagle Hotel. The Fathers, whose names are remembered
							by the early settlers are: Fathers John and Ignatius.</p>

						<p>The succession of priests, who attended Wheatfield from 1886 till the present time,

							Koenig, Lowell, from September 1898 till August 6, 1905; Fathers C. PP. S., since
							August 1905, under the direction of Father Gietl. These Fathers were resident at the
							so-called Indian School, near St. Joseph's College. Father Shunk, in 1886, organized
							the congregation at Wheatfield, and constructed a log church, 12x16 feet, and
							dedicated it to the patronage of the Sorrowful Mother. At that time the parish
							consisted of six families. He attended from Wanatah, a distance of thirty miles. Some
							of the people had to come ten miles to hear Mass. Two years and a half were spent in

							church is a frame structure, and can accommodate 150 persons. Father Grussi, in his

						<p>It was at the home of Patrick McDonald, who settled at Winchester, in 1854, that Rev.

					<p>A Golden Jubilee is one of the occasions upon which a strain of eulogy is admittedly
						congruous to voice or pen. Mere self-glorification, the boastfulness of pretentious
						vanity is indeed perenially censurable; but the symmetrical rounding-out of a man's, or
						an institution's, full half-century of beneficent activity amply justifies the accents
						of panegyric in recounting the virtues of the one or in recapitulating the glories of
						the other. In the case of the fiftieth anniversary of a diocese, many of whose founders
						and builders have gone to the reward of their zealous labors, there needs no other
						warrant for encomiastic tributes than the scriptural counsel: "Praise we now the men of
						renown, our fathers in their generation." It will accordingly be not only permissable,
						but thoroughly in harmony with the purpose of this commemorative volume, to record
						herein the narrative of a district, the possession of which within its boundaries
						constitutes for the diocese of Fort Wayne a glory greater than accrues to any other see
						in this country, not to say the major part of the Catholic world.</p>

					<p>Even apart from its specific appropriateness to the present history, the tale of Notre
						Dame's humble foundation, rapid growth, and marvellous development is the story which,
						as illustrating the filial reliance of one Knight of Mary on the protecting care of the
						Mother whom he loved so tenderly, and as emphasizing the congruousness of unlimited
						trust in the Blessed Virgin, can scarcely be told too often. It is a story of notable
						deeds performed by men of faith; an account of <milestone unit="typography" n="---"/>

							O'Neill, C. S. C.</note>
						<pb id="VAB8203-430" n="430"/> Herculean labors undertaken with an eye single to the
						glory of God and His gracious Mother; a record of zeal rewarded, of sacrifices blest, of
						love triumphant over every obstacle.</p>

					<p>Sixty-five years ago, when a poor young foreign missionary priest and five poor foreign
						religious Brothers settled in Northern Indiana upon an uncultivated tract of forest
						land, with naught but a little rude log cabin to distinguish it from the merest sylvan
						wilderness, confidence in the Mother of God, supplemented by their individual labors,
						was the only capital they had to invest in the arduous enterprise of founding in this
						Western country a shrine of religious education. No princely endowments, no munificent
						donations of a million dollars, or a hundred thousand, or a thousand, came to accelerate
						their material prosperity; and yet never did dollars and cents invested in a business
						venture yield such magnificent results as have sprung from their steadfast reliance on
						our Lady's aid, and their constant endeavors to procure her favor. Much is written from
						time to time of the wondrous development, especially since 1871, of the great Western
						metropolis; but stupendous as has been the growth of the old-time village by Lake
						Michigan that has come to be Chicago, the political economist, taking account of merely
						human resources, will find it an easier matter to explain that growth, than to assign
						the causes of the marvellous transformation, that has made of the barren wilderness on
						the banks of the St. Joseph River the most splendid sanctuary of religion and science to
						be found on the continent. The true explanation is beyond the economist: Notre Dame was
						built with "Hail Marys."</p>

					<p>Essential to a proper understanding of what has been accomplished in this garden-spot
						of the Church in America is a brief account of the religious family that has attended to
						its cultivation. The Congregation of Holy Cross was in its inception, a by-product of
						the great French Revolution, or, rather, of the reaction from the frenzied hatred of
						religion and religious education that marked the decade, from the meeting of the States
						General in 1789 to the end of the Directory in 1799. As at present constituted; the
						Congregation is the result of Rome's officially uniting two distinct societies, the
						Brothers of St. Joseph, founded at Ruille in 1820, and the Auxiliary Priests of Mans,
						established in 1835.</p>

					<pb id="VAB8203-431" n="431"/>

					<p>An excellent summary of the purposes and activities of the amalgamated associations is
						given in the following letter, dated May 4, 1840, and addressed to Pope Gregory XVI by
						Mgr. Bouvier, Bishop of Mans: <q rend="blockquote">
							<p>"Basil Anthony Moreau, honorary canon, and former professor of theology and holy
								scripture in our diocesan seminary, has, with the consent of the present bishop,
								established a house<ref id="ref_004" rend="super" target="note_004">*</ref> near the
								city of Mans, and has there assembled certain priests burning with love for souls
								and enamored of poverty and obedience, who follow the community life under his
								direction, and are always ready to announce the word of God, to hear confessions, to
								conduct retreats for communities, etc. They are called Auxiliary Priests and are
								already fifteen in number. They live on voluntary offerings and on the profits
								accruing from the board and tuition of a hundred pupils.</p>
							<p>"As the Brothers of the Christian Doctrine do not undertake the charge of
								establishments unless they can live at least three together and receive an annual
								salary of six hundred francs each, they cannot be procured for schools in the
								country parishes and the small towns. A pious pastor of Ruille, James Francis
									Dujarie<ref id="ref_005" rend="super">#</ref>, about the year 1820 gathered into
								his presbytery a number of virtuous young men, kept them at his own expense, taught
								them, and prepared them to become primary teachers for the parishes in which the
								services of the Christian Brothers were unattainable. Thus were founded the Brothers
								of St. Joseph.</p>
							<p>"The present Bishop of Mans, seeing that the novitiate of these Brothers could not
								be suitably maintained in the country district, took measures to transfer them to
								the episcopal city. With the consent of the founder who was still alive, though
								weighed down with infirmities, he gave to the congregation as Superior the
								aforenamed Fr. Moreau. The latter, having nothing in view but the good of religion,
								assumed the heavy burden and united the novitiate to the Auxiliary Priests. Thus
								there are now in the same house the Auxiliary Priests, the pupils, the novice
								Brothers, and the teachers. This new institute already numbers eighty persons
								scattered through thirty-nine establishments, and forty-five novices. Yesterday

								priests, set out to build up an establishment in Algeria, Africa, and others will
								soon be sent to the diocese of Vincennes in America."</p>
						</q>
					</p>

					<p>The concluding sentence of Bishop Bouvier's letter affords the natural transition from
						the history of the Congregation's origin in the old world to the story of its initial
						activities in the new. Some years prior to the date of the foregoing letter, Vincennes'
						first bishop, Mgr. Brute of saintly memory, had made earnest and eloquent appeals in
						different diocesan seminaries of France for missionaries to aid him in the arduous work
						of spreading the gospel through Indiana; and his successor, Bishop de la Hailandiere,
						had, in 1839, specifically pleaded with Fr. Moreau for volunteers from the ranks of Holy
						Cross to work on the American mission. Volunteers were not wanting, but lack of material
						resources prevented for some months the execution of the desired project, the migration
						across the Atlantic of some priests and Brothers of the youthful religious family of
						Holy Cross. Not, indeed, till a year after the date of Bishop Bouvier's communication to
						Rome, did Mgr. de la Hailandiere receive the assurance that his hopes were about to be
						realized. In the summer of 1841 there came to him a letter from the young priest whom
						Fr. Moreau, with admirable, not to say prophetic, provision, had selected as leader of
						the American mission band. A brief extract from this hitherto unpublished letter merits
						reproduction here, as showing the quality of its author and the sentiments with which he
						looked forward to a life that humanly speaking, could scarcely be other than one of
						exile, privation, unceasing toil, and infrequent consolations: <q rend="blockquote">
							<p>"Never has Divine Providence appeared to me so kind, so merciful, so lovable; never
								has my heart been so touched with His goodness and so happy, as since I have learned
								that it is I whom He has deigned to select in order to give your Lordship one more
								priest to labor in your immense diocese for the glory of God and the salvation of
								souls. Would that I had been able, Monseigneur, to announce to you my happiness long
								before this, and to have sooner relieved your own anxious uncertainty with respect
								to our Community; but we had perforce to await the manifestation of Heaven's will.
								Personally, I have not the slightest doubt of that will. It seems to me <pb
									id="VAB8203-433" n="433"/> that our Good Master is leading me towards you by the
								hand, as it were; and 'tis this that fills me with ineffable joy."</p>
						</q>
					</p>

					<p>To the letter from which the foregoing paragraph has been extracted there was signed
						the name of a young Levite just twenty-seven years old, whose ordination as a priest of
						Holy Cross had taken place three years before. While his exemplary piety, his burning
						zeal, and his intellectual equipment justified his Superiors in expecting notable
						results from his labors in the field to which they appointed him, it is extremely
						doubtful whether Fr. Moreau who sent, or Bishop de la Hailandiere who received him, had
						formed at that time any measurably adequate idea of the magnitude which those results
						were to assume, even during the Levite's lifetime. Read by the Bishop of Vincennes in
						1841, the young missionary's name told little or nothing; read today, in the light of
						two-thirds of a century's experience, that name connotes a heroic figure in the history
						of the Church in America; a foremost champion of the twin causes that make for the
						permanent prosperity of our Republic, religion and education; and one of the most
						loving, dauntless, and victorious Knights of Our Lady that ever wore her colors and
						extended her sway in this Western hemisphere, Fr. Edward Sorin, Founder of Notre
						Dame.</p>

					<p>Accompanied by six brothers, Fr. Sorin took passage, in August, 1841, in the steerage
						of the packet boat Iowa at Havre; reached New York on September 13th; said his first
						Mass in the new world on the next day, by a happy coincidence the Feast of the
						Exaltation of the Holy Cross; and, proceeding by canal boat and stage coach, finally
						reached Vincennes on the second Sunday of October. An incident deservedly mentioned by
						all chroniclers of the arrival of Holy Cross' pioneer priest in America is his first act
						on landing at New York; he fell on his knees and, as earnest of his unswerving fealty to
						the country of his adoption, devoutly kissed the soil. In a similar spirit, he concluded
						his first letter to Fr. Moreau with-- "Here is the adoption of my inheritance; here will
						I dwell all the days of my life."</p>

					<p>The activities of the Holy Cross missionaries during their first year in Indiana found
						their scope at St. Peter's, twenty-seven miles east of Vincennes; but the religious were
						permanently settled only in the following year, 1842. Bishop de la <pb id="VAB8203-434"
							n="434"/> Hailandiere proffered to the Community, and Fr. Sorin gratefully accepted, a
						tract of land near the village of South Bend on the St. Joseph River. The gift was
						subject to two conditions: That a college and a novitiate should be built within two
						years; and that the Indians and the white settlers in the neighboring districts should
						receive Fr. Sorin's sacerdotal ministry. The acceptance of the gift definitely fixed the
						residence of the Congregation in a territory which, a decade and a half later was to
						form a portion of the new diocese of Fort Wayne.</p>

					<p>Of the territory in question, the author of "The Priests of Holy Cross"<ref
							id="ref_006" rend="super" target="note_006">*</ref> gives the following interesting
						historical sketch "Over this ground passed the saintly Marquette more than two hundred
						years ago and in an unknown grave some-where along the banks of the St. Joseph's River a
						mile away sleeps the ashes of the great Allouez. La Salle and Tonty and the picturesque
						Hennepin wandered through these woods, and within a short afternoon's journey from Notre
						Dame is the site of the old fort St. Joseph where was fought a brief but terrible battle
						in the days of discovery. In 1831 Fr. Stephen Theodore Badin, the first priest ordained
						in the United States, purchased a section of land surrounding the twin lakes with the
						express design of holding it as the site for a future Catholic college, and in 1836 he
						had given it to the Bishop of Vincennes to be used for that purpose. Fr. Badin had made
						Notre Dame a centre of missionary activity throughout Northern Indiana and Southern
						Michigan, and his successor Fr. Deseille, following in the footsteps of the zealous
						proto-priest, had made his home for five years in a room of the little chapel of the
						mission. In the autumn of 1837, however, this holy missionary fell into a mortal
						illness. <milestone unit="typography" n="***"/> An hour before he breathed his last he
						had himself lifted from his deathbed and borne in the arms of his sorrowing Indians to
						the chapel. Still supported on either side, he had strength enough to clasp the key of
						the tabernacle in his trembling fingers and to administer to himself the Holy
						Viaticum.</p>

					<p>"The next apostle of Notre Dame was Fr. Benjamin Petit. Two days after his ordination
						he was sent to 'succeed a saint,' as Bishop Brute told him in commissioning him to take
						up the <milestone unit="typography" n="---"/>
						<note id="note_006"><ref target="ref_006" rend="super">*</ref>Rev. John Cavanaugh, C. S.
							C.</note>
						<pb id="VAB8203-435" n="435"/> work of Fr. Deseille. Of all the early missionaries this
						brilliant and magnetic young priest was most affectionately regarded by both the
						settlers and the Indians; and when he died, scarcely twelve months after his ordination,
						he was loved as Fr. Sorin tells us, 'as none of his predecessors, excellent as they
						were, had ever been loved.'"</p>

					<p>To the district thus consecrated by the labors of zealous pioneer missionaries, and
						redolent of hallowed memories of saintly confessors and quasi-martyrs, came, then, in
						1842, the builder of the later Notre Dame, no unworthy successor to even the holiest and
						hardiest of those who had gone before him. His own account of his arrival reads less
						like the description of an Indiana journey of only sixty-five years ago than-of an event
						at least thrice as far distant "in the dark backward and abysm of time."</p>

					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"We started (from St. Peter's) on the 16th of November," he wrote, "and indeed, it
							required no little courage to undertake the journey at such a season. I cannot but
							admire the sentiments with which it pleased God to animate our little band, who had
							more than one hundred miles to travel through the snow. The first day the cold was so
							intense that we could advance only about five miles. The weather did not moderate for
							a moment; each morning the wind seemed more piercing as we pushed forward on our
							journey due north. But God was with us. None of us suffered severely, and at length,
							on the eleventh day after our departure, five of us arrived at South Bend, the three
							others being obliged to travel more slowly with the ox team transporting our
							effects.</p>
						<p>"A few hours afterwards we came to Notre Dame du Lac. Everything was frozen and yet
							it all appeared so beautiful. The lake, particularly, with its mantel of snow
							resplendent in its whiteness, was to us a symbol of the stainless purity of our august
							Lady whose name it bears, and also of the purity of soul which should characterize the
							new dwellers on these beautiful shores. Our lodgings appeared to us-- as indeed they
							are-but little different from those at St. Peter's. We made haste to inspect on the
							banks of the lakes the various sites which had been so highly praised. Yes, like
							little children, we went from one extremity to the other, in spite of the cold,
							perfectly enchanted with the marvellous beauties of our new <pb id="VAB8203-436"
								n="436"/> abode. Oh, may this Eden ever be the home of innocence and virtue! Once
							again in our life we felt that Providence had been good to us, and we blessed God with
							all our hearts."</p>
					</q>

					<p>The detailed story of the development of Notre Dame from the creation of the first
						college building, the corner-stone of which was laid in August, 1843, to the magnificent
						group of more than a score of handsome edifices-- collegiate church; central
						administration building; residence halls; institutes of science, technology, and
						electrical and mechanical engineering; theatre; gymnasium; provincial residence;
						seminary; novitiate; community house; printing offices; and half a dozen accessory
						structures-would occupy many times the space alloted to this chapter. The most that can
						be attempted is a rigidly summarized account of this gratifying growth and a brief
						mention of the especially notable events in the history of the University. Sadly
						prominent among these latter is the epidemic of cholera that ravaged the ranks of the
						Community in 1854, carrying off the members with a rapidity and a violence that
						threatened the total extinction of Holy Cross in America. It was a trial calculated
						permanently to discourage any leader of less than heroic mould; but, indomitable in his
						zeal for God's glory, and supremely confident in the unfailing assistance and protection
						of his Heavenly Mother, Fr. Sorin not only preserved his own courage but effectively
						rallied the drooping spirits of all his surviving co-workers, and the work of growth and
						expansion went on uninterruptedly.</p>

					<p>Eleven years after the cholera scourge, this expansion justified the erection of a new
						and a more commodious college building. Begun in 1865, it was completed early in the
						following year, and was dedicated on May 31, 1866, by Archbishop Spalding of Baltimore.
						The new edifice, a hundred and sixty feet long by eighty feet in width, was six stories
						high, and was surmounted by a colossal statue of Our Lady. These ampler accommodations
						were taken advantage of by a steadily increasing number of students, and the annals of
						the following thirteen years record a tale of continuous progress and prosperity.</p>

					<p>In 1879, however, the tale takes on another and a more sombre hue. On April 23, of that
						year, occurred a disastrous fire which in a few hours reduced to ashes not only the main
							<pb id="VAB8203-437" n="437"/> university structure but almost every other building in
						its immediate neighborhood. Apart from the destruction of much that money could never
						replace, the financial loss was, to a religious community, tremendous; and the available
						insurance was trifling. The way in which the disaster was met illustrates, better than
						would do pages of analytical exposition, the spirit that has ever dominated the builders
						of Notre Dame, and furnishes the key to the undeniably magnificent success that has
						crowned their efforts. With whole-hearted devotedness and whole-souled devotion they
						worked and prayed, may, rather, they prayed and worked. The first gift towards the
						building of a new university that Fr. Sorin received-- it was a check for one thousand
						dollars-- he sent to a priest in a distant city with a request for prayers and Masses in
						behalf of Notre Dame. Trust in Providence and in Our Lady was accompanied, in those
						heart-rending April days of 1879 as always in the history of the Congregation, by
						untiring personal exertion on the part of all its members. Before the ashes of the old
						buildings were cold the work of constructing the new ones was begun; and in September of
						the same year they were opened to a larger number of students than the fire had
						dispersed.</p>

					<p>Since 1879, no untoward event has occurred to arrest the progress of the University,
						whose teaching faculty of more than three score members now proffer to a body of
						students numbering from seven to eight hundred no fewer than thirteen collegiate
						courses-in classics, letters, economics and history, journalism, art, science, pharmacy,
						law, engineering (civil, mechanical, chemical and electrical), and architecture, in
						addition to thorough preparatory and commercial courses.</p>

					<p>It is certainly not strange that, looking upon the material evidences of the success
						which has so abundantly crowned the faith and zeal of Fr. Sorin and of his co-laborers
						and successors among the Fathers and Brothers of Holy Cross, men competent to speak
						authoritatively on the subject, have repeatedly averred that the University of Notre
						Dame is not merely a 'peerless blessing and unrivalled glory to the diocese of Fort
						Wayne, but the greatest tribute which the Western hemisphere has thus far offered to the
						Blessed Virgin. In very truth, the star-crowned colossal statue of Our Lady, dominating
						at a height of more than two hundred feet the golden dome of the <pb id="VAB8203-438"
							n="438"/> central edifice; the adjacent noble church, that treasure-house of religious
						art and beauty, from whose belfry a brazen-throated monster booms out the Angelus with
						an exultation that drowns the loudest shriek and roar of factory and railway; the
						number, variety, and thorough equipment of libraries, laboratories, halls, ancillary
						departments-- these naturally impress the minds and are apt to elicit the enthusiastic
						praises of even the most transient visitors to Our Lady's Indiana home.</p>

					<p>And yet, without minimizing in any degree the true significance of the noble
						University-- fully acknowledging, on the contrary, both the capital importance of the
						Catholic education for which it stands, and the far-reaching beneficent influence of the
						thousands who have learned, and are learning, within its walls to combine practical
						virtue with intellectual development,-- it may be questioned whether Fr. Sorin did not
						found a still greater work than the University, dower Fort Wayne with its most glorious
						possession, and establish his own highest claim to the Blessed Virgin's favor when, in
						1865, he began the publication of <hi rend="i">The Ave Maria.</hi> "They who declare me
						shall have life everlasting," was the significant text of the first sermon he ever
						preached on Our Blessed Lady; and assuredly through no other agency in either hemisphere
						during the past four decades have Mary's dignity and prerogatives, her beauty and her
						glory, the omnipotence of her supplication and the unfathomable depths of her
						compassionate tenderness, been declared so constantly and so adequately, with such
						loving enthusiasm and persuasive insistence, as through the salutary pages of that
						magazine, "devoted to the honor of the Blessed Virgin," and wearing as its appropriate
						title the Angel of the Incarnation's greeting to the Lily of Israel, the Judean Maiden
						"full of grace."</p>

					<p>The press in our day is rightly regarded as the university of the people; it is a
						perennial school and college from the influence of whose lessons and lectures no
						graduation-day will ever mark the people's deliverance. Catholic journalism in
						particular has come to be regarded, notably during the pontificate of Leo XIII and that
						of our present Sovereign Pontiff Pius X., as an apostolate whose practical importance it
						is difficult to overestimate. Of late years the members of the hierarchy in frequent
						pastoral letters, and the ablest pastors <pb id="VAB8203-439" n="439"/> in occasional
						pulpit utterances, have emphasized the duty, and, as a preservative of the faith, the
						quasi-necessity, binding the faithful to support the Catholic paper and magazine. Fr.
						Sorin, with the prevision of a seer, recognized the growing ascendancy of the press at a
						period when its coming dominance was not so patent as at present, and forthwith seized
						it as one of the engines with which he and his congregation should do mighty things for
						the glory of God, the honor of God's Mother, and the upbuilding of the Church in
						America.</p>

					<p>Of all the works of that venerable patriarch, the great good priest whose bronze
						counterfeit now meets one's gaze at the very entrance to Notre Dame, <hi rend="i">The
							Ave Maria</hi> has ever appeared to the mind of the present writer the very noblest,
						most blessed, and most meritorious; the worthiest of his offerings to his beloved
						Mother, and the Congregation of Holy Cross, most estimable service to the
						English-speaking Catholic world. It would be easy, were space available, to fortify this
						opinion with a wealth of testimony proffered by the prelates and the press of many
						climes, all certifying in terms of fervid eulogy to the notable excellence of this
						"ideal Catholic family magazine." Who, indeed, that even partially apprehends the import
						of the Catholic press in this day of virulant attacks on the faith from without, and, as
						Pius X has recently declared, of still more deplorable undermining of that faith by some
						of those within the fold; who that has seriously pondered the magnitude of the results
						to religion and society involved in the nature of the household's reading, will venture
						to estimate the measure of good that has been, and is being, accomplished by the weekly
						visits of Our Lady's magazine to tens of thousands of Catholic homes in this republic
						and in many a land beyond the ocean!</p>

					<p>Any mention of this special glory of the Congregation of Holy Cross would be inadequate
						did it fail to note one particular in which the magazine differs from the University, as
						from other works of the Community. Founded, like them, by Fr. Sorin, it has developed
						and prospered under the direction of one mind rather than many. The University of Notre
						Dame, as it stands today, is the resultant achievement of successive presidents; Fathers
						Dillon and Corby, Lemonnier and Colovin, Walsh and Morrissey and Cavanaugh; <hi rend="i"
							>The Ave Maria</hi> is <pb id="VAB8203-440" n="440"/> virtually the work of one man,
						who has stood at its editorial helm for upwards of three decades, and has identified his
						life with its progress, Fr. Daniel E. Hudson.</p>

					<p>Not that either the editor of <hi rend="i">The Ave Maria,</hi> or any one of the
						presidents just mentioned would dream of arrogating to himself alone the credit of the
						good accomplished and the success achieved. Devoted and energetic co-workers they all
						have had, not only in their fellow priests and the lay and teaching Brothers of the
						Congregation, but in the Sisters of Holy Cross as well. While the specific story of
						these Sisters will be found in another chapter of this book, the symmetry of the present
						chapter would be sadly imperfect, and the story of Notre Dame be lamentably incomplete
						if brief reference at least were not made to the genuinely important, if congruously
						unobtrusive, r61e played in that story by these self sacrificing daughters of Father
						Sorin. In the composing room of <hi rend="i">The Ave Maria,</hi> as in St. Edward's Hall
						of the University, in laundry and kitchen and infirmary and sewing room, they have, all
						through the years of Notre Dame's trials and triumphs, contributed their full share of
						cordial sympathy, ungrudging work, and efficacious prayer.</p>

					<p>So, too, of the Brothers of Holy Cross. A constituent element of the
						Congregation-numerically, indeed, its larger element-Notre Dame owes to their
						devotedness and their spirit of self-sacrifice far more than thrusts itself upon the
						notice of the superficial observer. Inconspicuous as the majority, especially of the lay
						Brothers, uniformly appeared; as hidden from the public gaze as are the stokers of a
						mammoth ocean liner,-- they have, throughout every decade since the winter of 1842, done
						valiant work not less essential to the rise and progress of Notre Dame than is the
						stoker's activity to the speeding of the steamship. Not only in class-room and
						study-hall, in students' office and on the campus, in residence halls and dormitories,
						in press rooms and publishing offices, but on the farm and in the garden, in sacristy
						and store, and in each of the score of different trades and handicrafts, the Brothers of
						Holy Cross have superabundantly justified both the wisdom of their original union with
						the Fathers of the Congregation, and the foresight of Father Sorin in counting largely
							<pb id="VAB8203-441" n="441"/> upon them for the assistance imperatively needed in the
						prosecution of his life work.</p>

					<p>The activities of Holy Cross outside the diocese of Fort Wayne can claim no space in a
						commemorative volume such as this; so nothing need be said of the Congregation's
						enterprises in other portions of this country, or in Canada, India, or Rome. Apart from
						the educational and journalistic work that is being accomplished at Notre Dame, its
						diocesan activities are comprised in the school at Fort Wayne and in the pastoral charge
						of the eight churches in the city of South Bend. The historical sketches of these
						parishes appearing in another portion of this book obviate the necessity of dwelling
						upon them here.</p>

					<p>It would, however, be an unpardonable omission in any story, however brief, of Notre
						Dame and its builders to forego mention of the cordial relations that have always
						subsisted between the Congregation of Holy Cross and the great body of the secular
						clergy of Indiana; and it would be a still more unpardonable omission to neglect
						recording in this Golden Jubilee volume the Congregation's grateful appreciation of the
						manifold powers, the sympathetic encouragement, and the not infrequent cooperation for
						which its sincerest thanks have been due and rendered to the successive bishops of Fort
						Wayne, and not in least measure, to the present venerated incumbent of the see, the
						Right Reverend Mgr. Alerding. Deference to ecclesiastical superiors is a duty sedulously
						inculcated in the novitiates of Holy Cross, and harmonious action with episcopal
						authority its administrators have found to be a prerequisite condition for the blessing
						of God upon their words and works. It is a genuine pleasure to testify that nowhere in
						the sphere of the Congregation's activities has the duty been more easy, or the harmony
						more constant, than here in Northern Indiana.</p>

					<p>One word as to the present status of Holy Cross, and the promise of future development
						which that status seems to hold, will be a not inappropriate conclusion to this sketch
						of a Religious Congregation having its Mother-house within the diocese. In 1841 the
						Congregation numbered in the United States one priest and six Brothers; today the roll
						of ecclesiastics counts about one hundred and fifty, while the Brothers are nearly two
						hundred strong. The recent erection at Notre <pb id="VAB8203-442" n="442"/> Dame of
						Dujarie Institute, a house for young men aspiring to the Brotherhood, is an indication
						that under the administration of Very Reverend Provincial Morrissey, renewed efforts are
						to be made to foster vocations to the religious life, vocations which very certainly
						exist, and will assuredly fructify if only they be properly developed. The dismemberment
						of the Congregation in persecuted France is a calamity not without at least one
						compensating feature. The presence in any community, or in any diocese, of a veritable
						man of God is a benediction of priceless worth, and not only Holy Cross but the whole
						diocese of Fort Wayne may well rejoice in one result of French anti-clericalism, the
						permanent residence henceforward at Notre Dame of the Superior General of the
						Congregation, Very Reverend Gilbert Francais, C. S. G.</p>

						<milestone unit="typography" n="---"/> THE CONGREGATION OF THE MOST PRECIOUS BLOOD (C.
						PP. S.)<lb/> 1854.</head>

					<p>The Congregation of the Most Precious Blood was founded in the beginning of the last
						century by Ven. Casper del Bufalo, a priest of Rome and a Canon at St. Peter's, for the
						purpose of spreading the devotion of the Most Precious Blood and of the giving of
						missions. Upon an invitation of the Most Rev. ,John B. Purcell, D. D., Archbishop of
						Cincinnati, through his Vicar General Henni, the saintly Rev. Francis Salesius Brunner
						with several companions: Revs. A. Meyer, M. J. Wittmer, M. Probst, J. Ringele, P. A.
						Capeder, J. Van den Broek and J. B. Jacomet, embarked for America and arrived in
						Cincinnati on January 1, 1844. The Archbishop assigned to them the church of St.
						Alphonse at Norwalk, Huron county, Ohio. From here they were to extend their
						administrations and missionary labors over the entire northwestern portion of the
						diocese of Cincinnati. The band of priests set out heroically for the wilderness and
						began their work, visiting the settlers dispersed through this region, and building
						churches where-ever they found a number of the faithful sufficient to form the nucleus
						of a parish. If the prospects for the growth of the Catholic population within a certain
						locality seemed favorable, a convent was also erected in connection with the church to
						serve as a home for the missionaries, and in some cases also for the Brothers and
						Sisters.</p>

					<p>Of the number of convents thus founded mention may be made of two: St. Charles Boromeo
						at Carthagena, Mercer county, Ohio, and St. Mary's Home near New Corydon, Jay county,
						Indiana. The former is the Mother-house and <pb id="VAB8203-444" n="444"/> headquarters
						of the American Province of the Congregation of the Most Precious Blood and the seat of
						the Seminary, and the latter is the first foundation within the limits of the present
						diocese of Fort Wayne. Founded in 1854 it was continued as a house for a small community
						of Sisters, who support themselves by the labor of their hands. The chaplain, as well as
						the pastor of the Holy Trinity Parish Church and his assistant, reside near the convent.
						St. Mary's Church in Adams county is attended from here. For a number of years this
						remained the only charge of the Fathers of the Most Precious Blood in the Diocese of
						Fort Wayne. Several of the Fathers, however, notably Rev. Cosmas Seeberger, were engaged
						as missionaries and assistants to the pastors.</p>

					<p>In 1873 Bishop Dwenger, a member of the Congregation of the Most Precious Blood, asked
						them to assume charge of St. Peter's Church at Winamac. The parish of Indian Creek,
						begun at the same time, was afterwards incorporated into that of Pulaski. Both have
						continued since in charge of the Fathers C. PP. S. Mention must also be made of the
						labors of Rev. Dominic Shunk, C. PP. S., and others who had care of the scattered
						Catholics of a large portion of northwestern Indiana, building churches and chapels, and
						nursing the germs of Catholicity in a very unpromising field. Some of the churches thus
						founded, such as North Judson, Wanatah and others, are now in charge of resident secular
						priests.</p>

					<p>In 1888 the Society took charge of the Indian School at Rensselaer, which had shortly
						before been erected by Miss (Mother) Catharine Drexel. Here many Indian children
						received the rudiments of an education, and a training in piety and character, until the
						withdrawal of the government support in 1896 made a continuance of the work impossible.
						The farm and buildings were then rented by the Fathers C. PP. S. from the Catholic
						Indian bureau and later acquired by purchase. The building is now the home of two
						monthly Catholic publications, <hi rend="i">The Messenger and The Botschafter.</hi> At
						the time the Indian School was confided to the Fathers, St. Augustine's parish at
						Rensselaer was also placed in their charge.</p>

					<p>A few years later the first steps were taken towards the foundation of a Catholic
						college to be conducted by the Fathers C. PP. S. As this is now a flourishing
						institution of learning <pb id="VAB8203-445" n="445"/> and the chief house of the
						Congregation in the diocese a more detailed account must be given of its origin and
						growth. Upon the place now occupied by the College, the diocese had maintained an orphan
						asylum which was discontinued about 1884, the girls being removed to Fort Wayne and the
						boys to Lafayette. Bishop Dwenger, desirous of having a college for Catholic youth
						exclusively, invited the Fathers C. PP. S. to found a college here, offering them the
						land here for this purpose. The offer was accepted and a handsome building erected,
						which opened its doors in September 1891, under the name of St. Joseph's College. Its
						first rector was Rev. Augustine Seifert, C. PP. S., who was assisted by a faculty of
						five professors. The register of students for the first year shows fifty-four names.
						During the next few years the College grew rapidly, extending its course of instruction,
						perfecting its plan of teaching and general equipment, and more than doubling the number
						of students. In 1893 the main building was enlarged to twice its size and in 1897 a
						separate structure was erected for the use of the junior students and pupils of music.
						The grounds were also beautified, and various smaller buildings were added to supply the
						growing needs of the institution.</p>

					<p>Having thus increased its capacity the College was enabled to add a Normal Department
						to those already existing, namely, the Collegiate, Commercial, and Preparatory. <hi
							rend="i">The Collegian,</hi> a monthly journal, published by the students, was
						launched in 1894, to stimulate the literary activities of the students.</p>

					<p>In 1896 the first class in the Collegiate department was graduated. Since then the
						growth of the College has been a steady one, advancing each year in material equipment
						as well as efficiency. Whatever defects were found to exist in the course were remedied,
						more attention was given to branches that are of practical importance and usefulness,
						the various courses were systematized and harmonized, and some of them were reorganized
						in accordance with modern methods and standards. In all these changes approved methods
						were not discarded, nor the course of instruction weakened by the introduction of
						useless matter at the expense of the more important branches. While the students are
						encouraged to improve their literary, dramatic and oratorical abilities under the <pb
							id="VAB8203-446" n="446"/> supervision of the professor, they are not permitted to do
						so to the detriment of their regular studies. Nor are athletic activities allowed to
						usurp the interests of the students and to interfere with their work in the study hall
						and class rooms.</p>

					<p>In 1904 a long felt want of the students was met by the erection of a new gymnasium, at
						a cost of $30,000, to serve them for various social and athletic purposes. All the
						meetings of the students are held in the large hall, as are also the entertainments and
						contests. The stage is provided with several sets of beautiful scenery.</p>

					<p>In 1906 the curricculum was once more extended by the introduction of a course in civil
						engineering. The College is at present attended by more than one hundred and seventy
						students, and has a faculty of sixteen, of whom two are lay-men.</p>

					<p>In 1898, in compliance with the wish of his predecessor, Bishop Dwenger, Bishop
						Rademacher established the Fathers C. PP. S. in the city of Fort Wayne. The Very Rev.
						Henry Drees, Provincial C. PP. S. sent the Rev. Francis Nigsch, C. PP. S., to organize
						the parish of the Most Precious Blood in the northwestern portion of the city by
						erecting a church and school and also a Mission House. The parish has enjoyed a steady
						growth and is in a flourishing condition. At present the Fathers have a chaplain at St.
						Joseph's Hospital in Fort Wayne and at the Kneipp Sanitarium in Rome City. The Fathers
						C. PP. S., it can be said, have always endeavored to cooperate with the diocesan clergy
						in parochial, missionary and educational work.</p>

						<milestone unit="typography" n="---"/> THE SISTERS OF HOLY CROSS.<ref id="ref_007"
							rend="super" target="note_007">*</ref><lb/> 1843.</head>

					<p>The Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, founded at Le Mans, France, by the
						Very Reverend Basil Moreau, was still a young and comparatively unformed religious body,
						when the priests and Brothers of the Holy Cross, under the intrepid leadership of Father
						Sorin, left France for the New World. They came in answer to the call of Apostolic
						missionaries-- among them the saintly Brute, Bishop of Vincennes, and his successor,
						Bishop de la Hailandiere,-- and, in November, 1842, we find the pioneer band of Holy
						Cross on the banks of the St. Joseph River, dedicating their new home to Mary
						Immaculate, under the title <hi rend="i">Notre Dame du Lac.</hi></p>

					<p>In June, 1843, the first Sisters of the Holy Cross arrived in this country, and, viewed
						in the light of future developments, the names of these foundation religious, Sisters
						Mary of the Sacred Heart, Calvary, Bethlehem and Nazareth, seem to symbolize the
						two-fold nature of the life to which the sisterhood was called, that of Mary and that of
						Martha. The same year brought a second colony, and the little community at once took
						charge of the sacristy, infirmary, laundry, dairy and other domestic departments,
						forgetting in their devoted labors the cost of their sacrifice.</p>

					<p>With more than mere human foresight, Father Sorin saw the need of establishing the
						Sisters permanently and of opening a Novitiate. That the proposed Mother-House should be
						convenient to Notre Dame, and, at the same time, sufficiently distant to insure
						favorable conditions of cloistral isolation, was understood and appreciated by Father
						Sorin and the Sisters, <milestone unit="typography" n="---"/>
						<note id="note_007"><ref target="ref_007" rend="super">*</ref>Communicated.</note>
						<pb id="VAB8203-448" n="448"/> and the extensive tract of land at the disposition of the
						Congregation offered more than one advantageous site. Bishop Hailandiere, however,
						fearing that the proximity of two religious communities of women-- he himself had but
						lately brought the Sisters of Providence to <hi rend="i">Sainle Marie des Bois,</hi>--
						would prove detrimental to the growth of both institutes, refused permission to
						establish a novitiate and mother-house in his diocese, that of Vincennes.</p>

					<p>Father Sorin then addressed himself to Bishop Lefevre, of Detroit, who consented to a
						foundation at Bertrand, Michigan, about eight miles from Notre Dame. This permission was
						almost immediately withdrawn, at the instance of Bishop Hailandiere; but, through the
						mediation of Bishop Purcell, later Archbishop of Cincinnati, objections were over-ruled,
						the prohibition was removed, and the Mother-House of the Congregation of the Sisters of
						the Holy Cross in America was opened, at Bertrand, in July, 1844. In September of the
						same year, the first investiture in the habit of the Order took place, marking the
						beginning of growth in the humble community.</p>

					<p>From 1844 to 1855, the Congregation shaped itself along the various lines of work which
						Divine Providence seemed to point out, and the close of the first decade of activity
						found the Sisters not only carrying out the primal object of their coming to the New
						World,-- that is, the conduct of domestic affairs for the priests and Brothers at Notre
						Dame,-- but also charged with the care of a home for orphans and deaf mutes, an
						Industrial School and an Academy at Bertrand, and a school for Indians at Pokagon. This
						summary of achievement includes much unwritten history, unwritten but not unrecorded in
						the annals of eternity. The period, though one blessed with a measure of success, was
						wanting in the sense of stability which cannot be enjoyed by the children of the Church
						when full episcopal approbation is withheld. There was no censure on the Community, but
						the atmosphere had not the clearness of perfect understanding, and this took from the
						value of material successes which came as answer to labor and prayer.</p>

					<p>In 1855, with the permission of Bishop de St. Palais, of the diocese of Vincennes, the
						Mother-House of the Sisterhood, including the Academy and other interests connected with
						it, was transferred from Bertrand to its present site, a mile and a <pb id="VAB8203-449"
							n="449"/> quarter from Notre Dame, on a beautiful plateau overlooking the St. Joseph
						River, not far from the historic spot known as "the portage." The first buildings at St.
						Mary's were frame structures brought from Bertrand and Mishawaka, where the Sisters had
						opened a mission, and it is in connection with this transfer of the Community's
						headquarters that the name of Mother M. Angela, (Eliza Gillespie) begins to stand out
						prominently in the record of the growth and well-being of the Congregation of the
						Sisters of the Holy Cross. A woman of rare powers of mind and heart, she was an
						inspiration to those she so long served as superior and guided as friend and counsellor.
						For thirty-four years, Mother Angela spent herself in the service of the Congregation,
						and her influence is felt today in all that is best in the varied branches of the
						educational and hospital work carried on by the Sisters.<ref id="ref_008" rend="super"
							target="note_008">*</ref></p>

					<p>A new era opened with the founding of St. Mary's,and yet, when one looks back at the
						work accomplished in Bertrand, one realizes that in those early years the seeds of the
						later achievements were sown and nurtured. The Community in that formative period was
						stamped with the characteristics held to be its distinguishing marks today,-- a spirit
						of progress, common-sense, zeal, devotedness and self-sacrifice. As early as 1852, an
						Association of Children of Mary was formed, and affiliated by Father Sorin with the
						Sodalities of Paris and Rome. In 1854, the Sisters were enrolled as members of the
						Association of Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Thus we see that at the
						altar of God and the shrine of Our Lady, help and strength and courage were sought and
						found.</p>

					<p>The Diocese of Fort Wayne was erected as a separate See in 1857, and in the first
						incumbent, Bishop Luers, the Congregation had a sympathetic and staunch adviser and
						friend. 1855 to 1865 were crucial years, but years blessed by God. They witnessed a
						remarkable development as regards numbers and establishments. With the enlarged sphere
						of activity, came also burdens of responsibility, and as the organization became more
						defined in its work and methods, difficulties naturally arose, some because of relations
						with France, others <milestone unit="typography" n="---"/>
						<note id="note_008"><ref target="ref_008" rend="super">*</ref>This brief sketch does not
							permit the mention of other names also recorded in the memory of the Congregation as
							noble, heroic religious, who at different times were charged with the administration
							of affairs. For further notice of these, the reader is referred to "A Story of Fifty
							Years," issued by the Sisters of the Holy Cross, in 1905, in commemoration of St.
							Mary's Golden Jubilee.</note>
						<pb id="VAB8203-450" n="450"/> from conditions incident upon extension of interests.
						Through all the trials, the spirit of faith sustained the Sisters, and God's power was
						recognized in dark hours as in bright.</p>

					<p>In 1861, there were one hundred and sixty-five religious of the Holy Cross owing
						allegiance to St. Mary's, the Sisters on the various missions founded from the
						Mother-House included, and when war's desolation began to be felt, about one-half of
						that number responded to the call of obedience and went to the care of the sick and
						wounded. Their services had been solicited by Governor Morton, at the instance of
						General Lew Wallace, and Father Sorin knew the spirit of the Community when he asked for
						volunteers. The services of the Sisters were given in the military hospitals at
						Washington, Memphis, Paducah, Louisville, Cairo and Mound City, and on the hospital
						boats that bore the suffering soldiers from the scenes of strife to where they might
						receive medical attention and the care they needed. Of the four-score Holy Cross
						Sister-nurses of the Civil War, only twenty-two answer the roll-call today. The others
						have found eternal peace; and each year, on Memorial Day, when the students of St.
						Mary's place a laurel-wreath and flag on each of the graves, the living learn anew from
						the dead the lesson of love of country and love of God.</p>

					<p>Meanwhile, the work of building up the Congregation went on at home and on the
						missions, which were yearly increasing, thus spreading the Community and multiplying
						ways and means of doing good. Through all the varied works of the Sisters, Father Sorin
						was director, guide, father and friend; and when there was threatened misunderstanding
						of his attitude towards the Community, on the part of authorities in France and Rome, he
						was ready to sacrifice his personal hopes in regard to the Congregation, which he
						virtually founded, rather than in any way militate against its well-being. This
						interested and disinterested zeal for the Sisters characterized Father Sorin's spirit up
						to his latest years, and when he died in 1893, his last whispered prayers mingled with
						those of his devoted children of the Cross who were with him when the final summons
						came.</p>

					<p>The severance of relations with France and the recognition at Rome of the Sisters of
						the Holy Cross as a distinct Order, with St. Mary's as the Mother-House, marked 1869 as
						a year of renewed courage, and the twenty years that followed were <pb id="VAB8203-451"
							n="451"/> crowned in 1889 with the Apostolic Approbation of the New Constitution of
						the Congregation, which superseded that framed by France in the early formative years.
						This temporary approbation of Rome, announced to the Sisters by Bishop Dwenger, was
						finally confirmed in 1896 when the Congregation took its place as an approved Order of
						the Church.</p>

					<p>The object of the Congregation is the sanctification of its members and the salvation
						of souls. To this end it is devoted to education,-- conducting schools, parochial and
						academic,-- and to works of charity,-caring for the sick and for orphans. Though founded
						in France, the Community is American in spirit, having no distinction in dress or rank
						of choir and lay religious. Its members, one thousand in number, represent many
						nationalities, but all are unified under the banner of the Cross.</p>

					<p>St. Mary's is truly the "Mother-House," with all that the name implies, to the
						establishments under the care of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. It is the nursery of the
						order, the training school of the teaching body, the home of the Sisters. To give an
						idea of the growth of the Community in little more than half a century, we quote the
						following extract from the Jubilee book, published two years ago: <q type="blockquote">
							<p>"The most convenient summary of the missions conducted by the Sisters of the Holy
								Cross will, perhaps, be according to location, rather than date of foundation, and
								those nearest home are the establishments in the State of Indiana. First of these;
								even antedating the present Mother-House, is the home of the Sisters employed at
								Notre Dame. At that great centre of varied activities, the Sisters of the Holy Cross
								have the care of the sick, are charged with the domestic work, are engaged in some
								of the branches of the publishing department, and teach in St. Edward's Hall. St.
								Joseph's Academy, South Bend, is also one of the old foundations, and seems almost
								like a part of the Mother-House; it is the centre from which are supplied the
								teachers of the parochial schools attached to St. Patrick's, St. Mary's and St.
								Hedwig's congregations. On the east side of the city are Assumption School, the
								parish school of St. Joseph's church, and St. Joseph's Hospital, a splendidly
								equipped new building, on a height overlooking the St. Joseph River and valley. Near
								Fort Wayne is a mission that is <pb id="VAB8203-452" n="452"/> endeared by many
								associations, for it claimed the special and personal interest of Father Sorin,--
								the Academy of the Sacred Heart,-- which dates back to 1866. Like St. Mary's, it has
								the charm of solitude, and in its beautiful environment traditions find a favorable
								atmosphere. St. Rose's, Laporte; Holy Angel's and St. Vincent's, Logansport; St.
								Charles', Crawfordsville; St. Michael's, Plymouth; St. Vincent's, Elkhart; St.
								John's, Goshen; St. Marys, Union City; St. Paul's, Valparaiso; and St. Mary's,
								Anderson, are the other schools in the diocese of Fort Wayne, at present under the
								direction of the Sisters of the Holy Cross.</p>
							<p>"St. John's Hospital, Anderson, founded through the munificence of Mr. and Mrs.
								John Hickey, represents an important phase of the Congregation's active life, in a
								constantly growing field of Christian charity.</p>
							<p>"At Morris, Illinois, the Congregation conducts St. Angela's Academy and the
								parochial school attached to the Church of the Immaculate Conception. St. Angela's
								was founded in 1857, and has won an enviable name in the world of Catholic
								education. <milestone unit="typography" n="***"/> St. Patrick's, Chatsworth; St.
								Mary's Academy, Danville; St. Mary's School, Westville; St. John's School, Peoria;
								St. Mary's Infirmary, Cairo; and Our Saviour's Hospital, Jacksonville, are also in
								the archdiocese of Chicago. Ohio has one house of the Order, Mt. Carmel Hospital at
								Columbus, an institution which embodies, as some one well expressed it, all that
								science and heart can give to a home for the sick. Attached to it is a well
								organized training school for nurses.</p>
							<p>"The Eastern houses are near enough together to give the community the strength of
								union in that province, and at least two of the foundations claim nearly as many
								years as does the Mother-House itself. St. Patrick's School, Baltimore, was opened
								in 1859, and St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum, Washington, D. C., was founded in 1856. The
								latter institution has come to be a landmark in the Capital, and its wise
								administration has won for it encomiums from men of prominence and national fame.
								St. Cecilia's Academy has seen much of the changing panorama of Washington life, and
								viewing it from the heights she has gone on quietly, unaffected by time's
								vicissitudes. The Sisters who teach St. Peter's School make <pb id="VAB8203-453"
									n="453"/> St. Cecelia's their home. Holy Cross Academy is in the west end of the
								city, on Massachusetts Avenue, and numbers among its friends and alumnae many people
								of prominence in the District. From Holy Cross are taught St. Matthews' and St.
								Paul's Schools. The Reverend Dr. Stafford's new school, St. Patrick's Academy, is
								also in charge of the Sisters of the Holy Cross.</p>
							<p>"St. Mary's Academy, Alexandria, goes back to 1869 for its beginning, but can point
								to its fine newly-appointed Colonial mansion should anyone refer to an old-time
								atmosphere about the historic Virginia town. In Baltimore, the Sisters direct St.
								Patrick's School, St. Patrick's Orphan Asylum, and the Dolan Aid Asylum, on South
								Broadway, while in St. Pius' parish, they conduct the parochial school and St.
								Catharine's Normal Institute, founded under the auspices of Archbishop Bailey.</p>
							<p>"The community is represented at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, by three schools, Sacred
								Heart Academy, Sacred Heart School and St. Anthony's School. Farthest east is St.
								Paul's School, connected with the Paulist Church in New York. The southern province
								claims two foundations,-- both in Texas, -St. Mary's, Austin, one of the community's
								most important houses, and St. Mary's, Marshall. On our way west, we may mention St.
								Mary's School, Davenport, Iowa. In Utah are some of the community's most ambitious
								foundations,-- St. Mary's Academy and Holy Cross Hospital, splendidly equipped
								institutions and each doing exceptionally fine work in its line. The Sisters also
								care for the children at St. Ann's, an orphan asylum which is a monument to the zeal
								and charity of Bishop Scanlan. Ogden has one of the finest buildings in the State in
								Sacred Heart Academy, which holds a place second to none among the schools of the
								west. St. Patrick's School, Ogden; St. Mary's, Park City and St. Joseph's, Eureka,
								complete the Utah list. In Idaho, the Sisters of the Holy Cross are to be found at
								St. Teresa Academy and St. Alphonsus' Hospital, Boise City, and at St. Joseph's
								School, Pocatello. In California, the Sisters at St. Augustine's, Fresno; St.
								Charles', San Francisco, and Holy Rosary, Woodland, call St. Mary's "home"; and
								sunlit and fair as is their western abiding place, in days of <pb id="VAB8203-454"
									n="454"/> trial as in days of jubilee, their hearts turn to the 'old home
								ground.'"</p></q></p>

					<p>St. Mary's, besides being the Mother-House of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, is a most
						important Catholic educational institution for young women in the west. It stands for
						the highest and best in Catholic education. It is almost a little town in itself, for
						its buildings include the chapel,-- really a church in size and dignity of
						architecture,-- a smaller chapel, a facsimile of the Holy House of Loretto, and enriched
						with the indulgences granted to the <hi rend="i">Santa Casa,</hi> the presbytery, where
						the two resident chaplains dwell, the Sisters' Infirmary, the student's Infirmary, the

						<milestone unit="typography" n="---"/> THE POOR HANDMAIDS OF JESUS CHRIST.<lb/>
						1863.</head>

					<p>The community of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ was founded by Miss Catharine
						Kasper, a native of Dernbach, Germany. She was born May 26, 1820, of humble parents and
						throughout her childhood displayed the virtues which characterized and ennobled her
						later life. Humility, charity, compassion for the poor and love of poverty permeated and
						filled her heart with a great desire of consecrating herself to God. She was animated
						with the piety of Mary and the activity of Martha and therefore wished to combine the
						contemplative and active life in the service of her Master. She and two other young
						ladies took their vows and professed themselves Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ, on
						August 15, 1851. Sister Mary (Catharine Kasper) was chosen Mother General of the newly
						founded community and continued as such until her death, February 2, 1898.</p>

					<p>Though poverty reigned in the humble dwelling, which formed the home of the first Poor
						Handmaids, they proceeded at once to carry out their plans of aiding the poor sick.
						Mother Mary's filial confidence in the All-providing Hand of our Father never wavered,
						but confidently awaited the development of his plans. "Behold the handmaid of the Lord;
						be it done unto me according to Thy word," was her motto and so trusting in God she
						planted the mustard seed, which sprouted and grew to be a tree whose branches reach far
						and wide throughout Germany, Austria, England, Holland and North America.</p>

					<p>Mother Mary Kasper at first had no intention of engaging in the education and training
						of the young; she thought that far too high a calling for her community, which she
						intended <pb id="VAB8203-457" n="457"/> should be consecrated simply to the care of the
						sick and poor and especially of the orphans. But God had other designs and intended that
						the infant community should also share in the blessed work of Christian education. The
						humble servant of God recognized this in the various circumstances, which made it seem
						expedient to add a teaching body to her young order. Accordingly a normal school for the
						education of the Sisters, who were to become teachers, was established. They soon
						entered upon this work and until the breaking out of the Kultur-kampf conducted, in
						their native country, parochial schools, academies, boarding schools, kinder-gartens and
						industrial schools. During these troubled times they were deprived of the parochial
						schools, but continued in charge of the other educational institutions and of the
						hospitals, sanitariums, infirmaries and private nursing. At present the community
						numbers about three thousand Sisters. The rules for their government were approved by
						Pope Pius IX in 1870, and were confirmed by Pope Leo XIII in 1890.</p>

					<p>Through the efforts of Bishop Luers and Rev. Edward Koenig, pastor of St. Paul's Church
						at Fort Wayne, the community entered upon their labors in the diocese of Fort Wayne, on
						August 3, 1863. The first little band of Sisters, who came to the New World, were eight
						in number: Sisters Mary Rosa, Eudoxia, Hyacintha, Facunda, Matrona, Henricka, Bella and
						Remigia. Sister M. Rosa was the first superioress. She returned to Germany in 1872. Of
						the other seven four are dead, while Sister Hyacintha is still pursuing her holy
						vocation in Fort Wayne, Sister Henricka in Centralia and Sister Bella in Chicago. The
						place of their first residence in the diocese was Hesse Cassel, eight miles from Fort
						Wayne, from which place three sisters were called to Chicago in.1869 by the Very Rev.
						Peter Fischer, V. G., to take charge of the German orphan asylum. That asylum began with
						twelve children, but now shelters more than six hundred orphans.</p>

					<p>The community established itself in Fort Wayne on May 9, 1869, in the building known as
						the Rockhill Place. The present convent and chapel were erected in 1883 at a cost of
						$32,000. This convent is the provincial Mother-House for all the Poor Handmaids of Jesus
						Christ in America. Since its establishment the convent has now its third chaplain, the
						Rev. <pb id="VAB8203-458" n="458"/> Thomas Eisenring, C. PP. S. The other two were Rev.
						Theodore Hibbelen till February 2, 1886 and Rev. Julius Becks till December 3, 1889. The
						first young lady, who entered the community of the Poor Handmaids in America, was Miss
						Catharine Baker (Sister M. Joseph) on February 2, 1871.</p>

					<p>The first parochial school, conducted by the Poor Handmaids in this country, was that
						of St. Paul's Parish at Fort Wayne, of which they took charge on October 5, 1896. They
						also had charge of the school at Avilla, where they were engaged likewise in the nursing
						of the sick and of the school at Hesse Cassel, from which schools however they were
						withdrawn in 1877. Since October 25, 1878 they have conducted the parochial school of
						St. Joseph's Parish at Mishawaka, where they are engaged also in private nursing. The
						St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum at Fort Wayne has been entrusted to their care since
						September 19, 1887. They have been engaged in the work of teaching and private nursing
						in Arcola since December 19, 1895. A convent of theirs was established at South Bend on
						September 8, 1899, where they act as private nurses, caring for the sick in their homes.
						St. Roch's Sanitarium for consumptives was opened December 3, 1899. Their Holy Family
						Hospital at Laporte has existed since March 1, 1900.</p>

					<p>The labors of the Poor Handmaids in the diocese of Belleville are extensive. They are
						engaged in teaching and private nursing in that diocese at Carlyle, Germantown, Trenton,
						St. Libory, Mascoutah, Fayetteville, Millstadt, Centralia, Wendelin, Columbia, Hecker,
						Beckemeyer. In the diocese of Belleville they also conduct St. Mary's Hospital in East
						St. Louis, St. Vincent's Hospital in Belleville, St. Joseph's Hospital in Breese, and
						the Sacred Heart Hospital in Aviston. St. John's Orphan Asylum at Belleville is also
						entrusted to their care.</p>

					<p>In the diocese of Alton the Poor Handmaids have charge of St. John's school and St.
						Vincent's Home, both in Quincy, and of St. Boniface's School in Edwardsville. In the
						diocese of Superior they conduct St. Joseph's Hospital at Ashland, St. Francis' Hospital
						at Superior City and St. Mary's Hospital at West Superior. In the Archdiocese of St.
						Paul they have charge of the St. Alexander Hospital at New Ulm. In the Archdiocese of
						Chicago they conduct the St. Ann's Sanitarium and the St. Elizabeth's Hospital and
						Isolation Hospital. From <pb id="VAB8203-459" n="459"/> their convents at 52 Newberry
						avenue and 212 Hudson avenue they go as private nurses to care for the sick in their
						homes. In connection with the latter convent is a Kinder-garten in charge of the
						Sisters. In the same Archdiocese of Chicago they teach St. Augustine's and St. Henry's
						schools and have charge of the Guardian Angel Orphanage in the city of Chicago and of
						the Sacred Heart school at Melrose Park.</p>

					<p>The provincial heads of the community in America were successively: Mother M. Rosa till
						1872 when she returned to Germany and was succeeded by Mother M. Prudentia who gave
						place to Mother M. Secunda in 1885 and was in turn succeeded by Mother M. Hyacintha till
						1904, when Mother M. Secunda, the present provincial superioress, was again placed at
						the head of the community. The Poor Handmaids in America number four hundred and nine
						professed sisters, forty-five novices and thirty postulants.</p>

						<milestone unit="typography" n="---"/> THE SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS OF PERPETUAL
						ADORATION.<lb/> 1875.</head>

					<p>The community of the Sisters of St. Francis of the Perpetual Adoration was founded with
						the approval of the Right Rev. Conrad Martin, Bishop of Paderborn, Westphalia, Prussia,
						on December 20, 1860, in the town of Olpe, by Mary Teresa Bonzel. Its constitutions were
						approved by the Holy See on April 13, 1897. Its objects are: The sanctification of its
						members, perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, nursing of the sick and the
						education especially of poor and neglected children. In Germany the congregation numbers
						about one thousand Sisters in eighty establishments.</p>

					<p>Towards the end of the year of 1875, at the invitation of Bishop Dwenger, six Sisters
						of this community came to the United States. They arrived on December 12th and two days
						later reached their destination, Lafayette, Indiana. Unknown and without means they
						entered upon their work of charity. A small house was placed at their disposal, which
						they occupied until October, 1876. A benefactor, Albert Wagner, donated two lots to
						them, and on these the first buildings of the present St. Elizabeth's Hospital were
						erected. The corner-stone was laid on Trinity Sunday, June 11, 1876 and the dedication
						took place on November 19th, following. In 1879 the east wing, and in 1883 the west wing
						and the chapel were built. With the growth and prosperity of Lafayette grew also the
						demands on the Sisters' charity, so that in the course of time the erection of a new
						hospital became necessary. It was built in 1896, and the formal opening took place on
						January 6, 1897, after a pontifical high mass celebrated by Bishop Rademacher. This
						hospital, at that time, was deemed of sufficient size to meet all requirements of the
						Sisterhood for many years, but <pb id="VAB8203-461" n="461"/> the institution grew so
						rapidly, that the building proved inadequate to meet the demands of charity, and in 1904
						a large addition was decided upon, one wing to serve as the St. Francis' Convent for the
						Sisters, and another to contain a spacious chapel and to complete the original plan of
						St. Elizabeth's Hospital.</p>

					<p>The last addition is a substantial three-story structure of brick and stone, with
						basement and attic. The basement contains kitchen, dining rooms, and rooms for domestic
						purposes. On the first floor are the offices, parlors, private rooms and dispensary. On
						the second and third floors are dormitories and private rooms; also, community rooms.
						The attic contains dormitories and storage rooms. All the floors are reached by
						elevator. Pressed brick, sand-stone and terra-cotta trimmings are notable features of
						the building's exterior.</p>

					<p>The new chapel is of Gothic design, 128x50 feet. Pillars divide it into three aisles,
						the middle one 46 feet 6 inches, the side aisles 29 feet high. From the capitols of the
						pillars rise the groined arches of the ceiling, which, like the walls, is decorated in
						chaste colors, showing various religious emblems and designs. The sanctuary is notable
						for the harmonious blending of the colors of the decorations with the artistic memorial
						windows encircling the main altar. Of these windows there are seven in the sanctuary,
						and two in one and four in the other transept; two are in front of the chapel and eight
						in the side walls. The main features, however, are the three altars and the communion
						rail, all exquisitely carved in pure white marble. The sanctuary, the aisles and the
						sacristy floors are inlaid with mosaic tiling of artistic design. The dedication of the
						new chapel and the consecration of the three marble altars was solemnly performed by
						Bishop Alerding, assisted by a great number of priests, on December 31, 1905.</p>

					<p>The first superioress of the six sisters who came to Lafayette in 1875 was Sister
						Clara. After her death in 1878, Sister Deo Gratias was appointed to the office. In 1884
						she was recalled to Germany and Sister Hyacintha became her successor. In 1886 she also
						returned to Europe, and was succeeded by Sister Alphonsa, who was, at the same time,
						appointed Superioress Provincial of all the establishments of the community in the
						United States. Sister Alphonsa remained at <pb id="VAB8203-462" n="462"/> the head of
						the community until May 18, 1900, when she was called to her eternal reward. The best
						tribute that can be paid to her memory is that given by the splendid development and
						achievements of the Order under her leadership. The office made vacant by her death was
						filled on June 21st by the appointment, as Superioress Provincial, of Sister Josepha who
						is still at the head of the community.</p>

					<p>Only a small part of the magnificent work done by the Sisters of St. Francis of the
						Lafayette community is manifested in their local establishment. Besides those in the
						diocese of Fort Wayne, the Sisterhood established and conducts branch houses in the
						dioceses of Omaha, Denver, Kansas, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Nashville, Lincoln, St.
						Joseph, St. Louis, Chicago and Louisville. They have the following hospitals in Indiana:
						St. Elizabeth's at Lafayette, St. Margaret's at Hammond, St. Joseph's at Logansport, St.
						Edward's at New Albany, St. Anthony's at Terre Haute and St. Anthony's at Michigan City.
						In Illinois: St. Francis' at Evanston. In Ohio: St. Alexius' and St. John's at
						Cleveland. In Tennessee: St. Joseph's at Memphis. In Kentucky: St. Anthony's at
						Louisville. In Colorado: St. Anthony's at Denver, St. Francis' at Longmont, and St.
						Francis' at Colorado Springs. In Nebraska: St. Joseph's at Omaha, St. Mary's at
						Columbus, St. Francis' at Grand Island, St. Elizabeth's at Lincoln. In Kansas: St.
						Mary's at Emporia.</p>

					<p>The Sisters of St. Francis have charge of the following schools. In Indiana: In St.
						Boniface's and St. Lawrence's at Lafayette, in Sacred Heart at Fowler, in St. Joseph's
						at Kentland, in St. Mary's at Dunnington, in Sacred Heart at Remington, in St. John's at
						St. John, in St. Martin's at Hanover, Centre, in St. Casimir's at North Hammond, and in
						St. Bridget's at Logansport. In Tennessee: In St. Mary's at Memphis. In Kansas: In
						Sacred Heart at Emporia, and in St. Joseph's at Olpe. In Missouri: In Immaculate
						Conception at Union, in St. Mary's at Wien, in St. George's at Hermann, in St. Ann's at
						Clover Bottom. In Nebraska: In Immaculate Conception at Omaha, in St. Francis' at South
						Omaha, in St. Francis' at Columbus, in St. Francis' at Lincoln, in St. Bernard's at St.
						Bernard, in St. Mary's at St. Mary, in St. Anthony's at St. Anthony, in St. Francis' at
						Humphrey, in St. Joseph's at Platte <pb id="VAB8203-463" n="463"/> Centre, in St.
						Stanislaus' at Duncan, in St. Michael's at Tarnov, in St. Boniface's at Monterey, and in
						SS. Peter and Paul's at Krakow. In New Mexico: In Our Lady of Guadalupe's at Pena Blanca
						and in Our Lady of Gaudalupe's at James. They conduct a high school in St. Mary's Parish
						at Memphis, Tennessee, and an Academy in St. Francis' Parish at Columbus, Nebraska.</p>

					<p>In 1893 the Sisters accepted the charge and management of the St. Joseph's Diocesan
						Orphan Asylum at Lafayette. The number of Sisters there is twelve. In 1897 the Sisters
						of St. Francis opened the St. Anthony's Home for the Aged in Lafayette.</p>

					<p>The total number of the members of the Lafayette community of the Sisters of St.
						Francis in the United States is: five hundred and thirty-five professed Sisters, ninety
						novices, nineteen postulants. The general mother-house of the Sisters of St. Francis of
						Perpetual Adoration is at Olpe, Westphalia, Germany. The Provincial Mother-house and
						Novitiate for America is St. Francis Convent at Lafayette, Indiana.</p>

					<p>The celebrated missionary, Rev. John Medaille, S. J., of Le Puy, was the founder of the
						Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph, in the year 1650. The purposes for which it
						was established were: First, that the members of it labor earnestly for their own
						sanctification, aspiring to the most sublime degree of Christian perfection; second,
						that they assist their neighbor, as far as possible, by every work of mercy, both
						spiritual and corporal.</p>

					<p>The Sisters came to America in 1836, under the auspices of Bishop Rosati, locating at
						St. Louis. Since that year they have been introduced into many of the dioceses of the
						United States. In the year 1888 three Sisters of St. Joseph moved by the apostolic
						spirit, left their convent at Watertown, New York. They journeyed to Cape Vincent, and
						at this point crossed the St. Lawrence river to Kingston, Canada. It was a hazardous
						trip, for the spring thaw had begun and the ice was beginning to break. It was not
						without difficulty that a stage driver was secured to take them across the river. Before
						mounting the box the driver informed his patrons, that he must drive rapidly, to lessen
						the risk of breaking through. As they sped along the ice rose and fell, under the flying
						hoofs of the horses, and it was with a sense of relief and many a fervent thanksgiving
						to God, that the now thoroughly frightened Sisters left the vehicle. From Kingston they
						continued their journey by rail. Passing through Canada they encountered severe
						snow-storms, and they were almost frozen waiting to make connections at three different
						points. Many other obstacles hindered their progress. But, divine Providence over them,
						they reached their destination, Tipton, on the afternoon of March 15th, after three days
						of travel.</p>

					<p>Tipton, at that time, was a small county seat depending almost entirely upon the
						farmers for its life and traffic. There <pb id="VAB8203-465" n="465"/> were few Catholic
						families in the vicinity and the church was a small brick building, of which Rev. F. G.
						Lentz was the resident pastor. This priest with the approval of Bishop Dwenger, had
						induced the Sisters to come, and he now met them at the station with every demonstration
						of joy. All the members of the parish, old and young, vied with each other to bid the
						Sisters welcome and to supply their needs. For two weeks the Sisters partook of the
						hospitality of a kind lady, until their little cottage, on North Oak street, was ready
						to receive them. Only one room of this cottage was plastered; being used as a parlor
						during the day, then when calling hours were over, beds were brought in and removed in
						the morning, that breakfast might be served. These were times of trials, but the Sisters
						never lost courage. Total strangers to the people they soon became acquainted, and
						visions of the good that was to be accomplished in this new and wild country rose up to
						cheer them.</p>

					<p>The parochial school composed of a few children, but recently organized, had been
						taught by a secular teacher. Two rooms were now formed and the classes established by
						September of the year of their arrival. The first years of the Sisters' life in Tipton
						were filled with labor and anxiety. Their numbers were few, and they were unable to cope
						with the work which they found awaiting them. Sometimes it required more than ordinary
						religious fervor and courage to sustain the thought, that anything was being
						accomplished; unless it be the complete self-abnegation of the Sisters teaching school,
						making linens for the altar, training the choir, visiting the sick and the dying, and at
						eventide repairing to their little home, and with voices that never faltered, giving
						thanks to God for the rough, yet blessed path, they had chosen as their own. At one time
						the star of the little community it seemed was about to set, when Reverend Mother
						Gertrude was stricken with fever; but after weeks of anguish and suspense, of watching
						and praying, she was restored to her former health. Then too, five mounds in the
						Catholic cemetery marked the place, where rest the mortal remains of five devoted
						souls.</p>

					<p>Providence, ever kind and propitious, inspired the wealthy father of Mother Gertrude to
						provide the means necessary for the erection of a suitable convent for the Sisters. This
						structure <pb id="VAB8203-466" n="466"/> was erected in 1891, when the little cottage on
						Oak street was abandoned, and the Sisters moved into their new and commodious St.
						Joseph's Convent. The first graduation class of the high school received their diplomas
						in 1892; and this was repeated each year until at the present time, the Sisters point
						with pride to the numerous membership of the St. Joseph's Alumna Association.</p>

					<p>In 1893 ,Bishop Rademacher appointed Rev. Anthony J. Kroeger the Spiritual Director of
						the Sisters. It was at his suggestion that the valuable two hundred acre farm, located
						about one mile from Tipton, was purchased. The treasury of the community being empty,
						Father Kroeger himself furnished the required purchase money. On account of the rapid
						growth of the institution, the demand for more room and better accommodations became
						urgent. A splendid structure was erected, in 1903, to supply the demand. The new
						building stands on the two hundred acre farm, over-looking a scene of rural beauty and
						peace. The pure country air and the delights of the rustic scenery contribute to make it
						an ideal home for the student. Here are seen beautiful drive-ways, cement walks,
						artistic flower-beds, numerous shade trees, and a large campus on which the young ladies
						indulge in out-door games, and especially the fine, new gymnasium. The building, which
						is the Mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph and St. Joseph's Academy for young
						ladies, has a frontage of over 150 feet and a depth of 53 feet, and including the
						basement is five stories high. The basement, constructed of granite bowlders skillfully
						cut and laid, is occupied by steam boilers, the kitchen, the laundry department, two
						refectories and store rooms. On the first floor are the parlors, the chaplain's
						apartments, the chapel, reception rooms and the private offices of the Mother Superior
						and the Secretary. The class rooms, music rooms, library, commercial hall, a large
						assembly room, and sewing rooms occupy the second floor. The rest of the building is
						devoted to private rooms and sleeping apartments. The building can accommodate about one
						hundred students.</p>

					<p>St. Joseph's Academy, the parish schools at Tipton, Delphi, Elwood, Kokomo and St.
						Bridget's in Logansport are conducted by the Sisters of St. Joseph, and are all in a
						flourishing condition.</p>

						<p>It was in Maine, a province of France, that the community of the Sisters of
							Pr6vidence sprang into existence in 1806. Maine was the first to repair the fearful
							ravishes of the reign of terror. First and foremost in this work was the saintly Abbe
							Dujarie, pastor of the church of Ruille-sur-Loir, diocese of Le Mans. His noble work
							materialized in the formation of a religious community, the Sisters of Providence. His
							community combined the active with the contemplative life. The end proposed was to
							honor divine Providence by the education of youth and works of charity.</p>

						<p>The new community grew so rapidly and spread so widely that its reputation crossed
							the Atlantic; and in 1845, when a call from the wilds of Indiana reached Ruille, six
							valiant heroines, Mother Theodore the leader, responded. Mother Theodore possessed
							extraordinary mental endowments with a remarkable talent for government and a charming
							personality. Her marvelous success in the supervision of first class institutions
							during her nineteen years experience in the community had attracted the attention of
							the Royal Academy, and a Prefecture of the "Forty Immortals," after a profound test of
								<pb id="VAB8203-468" n="468"/> her abilities, bestowed upon her medallion
							decorations of royal distinction. Thus was the saintly foundress eminently fitted for
							her apostolate of education in the New World. In the short space of fifteen years her
							work was accomplished-- she had solidly established the communtiy. Her work has been
							ably continued by her successors. It has spread from the home diocese of Indianapolis
							to the dioceses of Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids, Omaha, Peoria, and to the archdioceses of
							Baltimore, Boston and Chicago. The community now numbers nearly a thousand, with a
							charge of twenty thousand children. St. Mary's Academic Institute, at St.
							Mary-of-the-Wood, is one of the foremost educational centers in the country.</p>

						<p>The Sisters of Providence were the first religious teachers in Fort Wayne. At the
							invitation of Father Benoit three Sisters from the infant colony opened St.
							Augustine's school in September, 1845. God blessed the work; it increased and
							prospered. New buildings and additions were erected at various times, but the Academy

						<p>The community of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood, whose Mother-house is
							located at Maria Stein, Mercer county, Ohio, was established in 1834 at Loewenberg,
							Switzerland. The Very Rev. Francis de Sales Brunner assisted by his saintly mother,
							the Ven. M. Anna Brunner, was the founder. The little community was prosperous; its
							chief object was the <pb id="VAB8203-469" n="469"/> veneration of the Most Precious
							Blood. In 1844 it had grown to such proportions that it could extend its activity to
							the New World. Father Brunner remained the spiritual director of the community till
							his death in 1859. It was he who, in 1853, bought two hundred and forty acres of land
							in Jay county, Indiana. A small log house was erected, which served as the first
							convent in the diocese of Fort Wayne. For several years the Sisters had to contend
							with extreme poverty and untold hardships. The blessing of God, however, rested upon
							their humble work, and, some years later, a more spacious building was erected, large
							enough to accommodate from forty to forty-five Sisters. Two Sisters teach the
							parochial school, located about one-fourth of a mile from the convent.</p>

						<p>Prayer and manual labor form the occupation of the community. By day and by night the
							Precious Blood of Jesus is offered to the Heavenly Father not only for the needs of
							the community itself, but also in behalf of Holy Church in general and the world at
							large. The zealous Sisters, engaged also in the work of Catholic education,
							established a parochial school at Winamac in 1873, at Garrett in 1888, in St. Joseph's
							Church at Laporte in 1896, in the Precious Blood parish at Fort Wayne in 1898, and at
							Rensselaer in 1903. They have the care also of the culinary department in St. Joseph's
							College and the so-called Indian School near Rensselaer. In 1901 the Kneipp Sanitarium
							near Rome City came into their possession.</p>

							1865.</head>

						<p>On July 31, 1847, a missionary band of four Sisters, accompanied by their venerable
							foundress, landed in New York; these four Sisters, known in later years as Mothers
							Caroline, Seraphina, Magdalena and Mary, were the pioneers of the School Sisters of
							Notre Dame in America. St. Peter Fourier of Lorraine, founder of the Congregation of
							these Sisters in 1597, is venerated as their special patron. The Order instituted by
							him was introduced into Bavaria, but during the troublous times of Napolean I, it was
							suppressed in that country. However, religious education was not to cease, <pb
								id="VAB8203-470" n="470"/> for God raised up two holy men, Bishop Wittmann of
							Ratisbon and Father Sebastian Job of Vienna, whose life's aim was to found a teaching
							Sisterhood for the poorer classes. This they succeeded in doing, modifying the Rules
							of St. Peter Fourier, as the times and circumstances -demanded. Mother Teresa
							(Gerhardinger), born in 1797, for years a secular teacher under the guidance of the
							pious Bishop, became the first superioress of the new Congregation in 1833, at
							Neunburg, near Ratisbon. In 1841 the Mother-house was removed to Munich, and here the
							Mother-general of the School Sisters resided.</p>

						<p>At the invitation of Bishop O'Connor of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, the Sisters came to
							America, and their first mission, which they were obliged to abandon later, was at St.
							Mary's, Elk county, Pennsylvania, a small settlement in the wilderness. Mother Teresa
							remained one year in America, and when she returned to Munich the Sisters were
							teaching at St. Mary's in Pennsylvania and in three of the Baltimore schools. In the
							latter city Mother Teresa established the first American Mother-house. In 1850 Mother
							Caroline was appointed Mother-vicar of the American houses, and was directed to open a
							Mother-house in Milwaukee. In 1880 she was elected Commissary-general for America; and
							this office she held till her death in 1892. The Eastern houses were formed into a
							separate province in 1876, with the Mother-house in Baltimore. A southern province,
							with its Mother-house at Santa Maria in Ripa, South St. Louis, was formed in 1897.</p>

						<p>Mother Caroline's labors during the first forty-five years ofthe Congregation's
							existence in America merited for her the veneration due to a foundress. She enjoyed
							the esteem of the Bishops of Fort Wayne; and St. Mary's mission, at Fort Wayne was the
							first established in Indiana, on September 2, 1865. The first community consisted of
							three Sisters and a candidate; and they were welcomed warmly by parents and children.
							At that time the attendance at school was two hundred girls; the boys being taught by
							lay-men in the school building on the opposite side of the street. In 1880 the Sisters
							assumed charge of the lower and middle classes of the boys' school; and ten years
							later they took the higher class of boys also. The enrollment was at that time about
							four hundred and fifty, four Sisters teaching the boys and four the girls, with two
							grades <pb id="VAB8203-471" n="471"/> in each room. At the present time the school has
							an attendance of about five hundred and fifty pupils. The Sisters in community number
							fourteen, and eleven of these are engaged in teaching.</p>

						<p>The School Sisters took charge of the following schools in the diocese of Fort Wayne:
							Fort Wayne, St. Mary's, in 1865; Huntington, SS. Peter and Paul's, in 1868;
							Logansport, St. Joseph's, in 1877; Fort Wayne, St. Peter's, in 1881; Chesterton, in
							1894; Michigan City, St. Mary's, and St. Stanislaus', and Alexandria, in 1897; and

						<milestone unit="typography" n="---" rend="center"/> DIOCESAN ORPHAN ASYLUMS.</head>

					<p>The Civil War, which spent itself at the cost of much life and wealth, left after it
						the orphan. Many of these were Catholic and, although the State made public provision
						for their support, it was plain that something must be done to save these children to
						the Faith. It was Bishop Luers, who initiated this great work of charity in the spring
						of 1865, when he purchased a tract of land in the suburbs of Fort Wayne, as the site for
						an orphan asylum. First his Vicar-General, the Very Rev. Julian Benoit, and later on the
						Rev. E. P. Walters, were commissioned by the Bishop to solicit money, for the erection
						of the necessary buildings. When, in the fall of 1865, Pope Pius IX proclaimed a solemn
						Jubilee, for the gaining of the indulgence of which an alms was required for some work
						of charity, Bishop Luers designated the orphan asylum as this special charity. He also
						addressed several pastoral letters to his diocesans, in one of which he says: <q>"In our
							day, many sympathize as little with poor Jesus as did the Jews of old, who only longed
							for a rich Messiah. They seek Him to this day without finding him, as Christ Himself
							told them. The promises of God in regard to the poor are disregarded, because the
							painful vices of avarice and pride have taken possession of their hearts. The spirit
							of religion and the love of neighbor impelled our forefathers, to erect magnificent
							churches, schools, orphan asylums, hospitals, universities, and other like
							institutions, to give learned men and saints to the land. Within these institutions
							men were trained for the object of their existence, and while the Te Deum resounds
							within those time honored walls, it is reechoed by the saints above, who erected those
							buildings."</q></p>

					<p>Much as the Bishop desired to commence the erection of the asylum, in 1866, unavoidable
						delays occurred in carrying out his plans. The following extract from an admirable <pb
							id="VAB8203-476" n="476"/> address on this subject, sent out immediately after the
						spiritual retreat of the clergy held at Notre Dame in 1867, will explain the situation:
							<q>"Dearly Beloved in Christ:-- The number of orphans has lately increased to such an
							extent, that the erection of an asylum for them has become an imperative necessity. It
							is a holy duty, incumbent upon us all, to take care of the spiritual and bodily wants
							of those, who have no longer father and mother to do it for them, and who like
							strangers now wander over God's wide earth, imploring our pity, mercy, and love. A
							year ago I purchased twenty-five acres of land, adjoining the city, for the purpose of
							building such an asylum upon it; but as yet it has not been commenced. On this all
							important matter I consulted with the clergy, lately assembled in spiritual retreat at
							Notre Dame, and as building materials and labor are yet very high, the building to be
							erected would cost from $30,000 to $35,000, which amount would have to be on hand
							immediately. To obtain this seems to be a matter of impossibility. It was therefore
							unanimously agreed, to accept the favorable offer of the Spilter Farm at Rensselaer,
							for $18,000. This place contains 933 acres; 650 of which are under fence, 200 under
							cultivation, 200 wood, the balance prairie. There are on it two dwelling houses, one
							of which contains twelve rooms, affording accommodation for forty or fifty orphans.
							Experience teaches that not a few of those, who have been raised in the asylums of our
							large cities, for want of suitable employment and from other unavoidable causes, have
							not realized the expectations, considering the extraordinary care and attention
							bestowed upon them. Here, upon the farm selected, the children can have employment
							suitable to their age and strength, and growing up with industrious habits, they can
							become men, who will be an honor to the institution, and a source of consolation to
							their benefactors."</q></p>

					<p>Having purchased the Spilter Farm, Bishop Luers appointed the Revs. E. P. Walters,
						George Steiner, J. Mayer, P. P. Cooney C. S. C., to collect throughout the diocese, and
						to prepare the buildings on the farm for the orphans. The Rev. Joseph Stephan was given
						charge of the institution. In September of 1868, thirty-five orphans found shelter here
						under the care of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. A circular addressed to the Clergy and
						Laity of the diocese, and dated <pb id="VAB8203-477" n="477"/> at Fort Wayne December
						10, 1869, is characteristic of Bishop Luers, and reads as follows: <q type="blockquote">
							<p>"We shall soon celebrate the Festival, which commemorates the Birth of the Redeemer
								of the world, and presents to our view the Divine Babe, lying in the manger of
								Bethlehem. The recurrence of this Festival is an occasion of great joy, especially
								to those families, whose members habitually fulfill their religious duties; and if
								in some there is negligence in the service of God during the year, Christmas is a
								time of reconciliation; all may, therefore, participate in the joy of this Festival.
								In these days of rejoicing, when you give thanks to God for the birth of your
								Saviour, and for all the spiritual gifts that flow therefrom, as well as the
								comforts of life which you have received from His bountiful hand, remember the poor
								in the orphans, who appeal to you to help them in their need, to clothe them and
								give them shelter from the frost and rain, and to prevent them from perishing with
								hunger.</p>
							<p>"As God has given you the fruits of this world, lay up for yourselves a treasure in
								heaven, by giving of your abundance to those who are in want. Do not begrudge a
								couple of dollars to the orphans. Be more manly, more human and more generous, than
								to make a wry face over a small portion of your abundance, given to the poor. God
								loves a cheerful giver. Do not, then, part with a few dollars, as if so many sound
								teeth were being pulled out of your head. Open wide your purse, give with a generous
								heart; avoid the stigma of stinginess, that mark of little souls and sordid hearts.
								Have a laudable respect for yourselves, as men occupying respectable positions in
								society, as Christians professing to be followers of our Lord, who loved the poor,
								and do not give merely twenty-five cents, when you could give four times that
								amount; do not place ten cents upon the collection plate, when you could give at
								least half that number of dollars. That you all may have an opportunity of
								fulfilling your duty of giving alms, we hereby direct that on Christmas-day the
								usual collection be made, in all the churches and stations, for the benefit of the
								Orphan Asylum, in which you should all take the greatest interest. Invoking upon you
								the abundant graces, which the Infant Jesus desires to bestow upon you all, and most
								particularly wishing that your hearts may be touched by <pb id="VAB8203-478" n="478"
								/> compassion for God's suffering poor, we commend you all to the Sacred Heart of
								Jesus, and to the Patronage of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart."</p></q></p>

					<p>Bishop Luers seemed quite at home, with his children at the orphan asylum. He used to
						assign work to them, and took part in their devotions and in their sports. He looked
						after the interests of the asylum, wherever opportunity offered, and after his death it
						was discovered, that he had had his life insured for $10,000, for their benefit.</p>

					<p>The house on the Spilter farm was turned into a Sisters' residence and school. Bishop
						Luers erected a two-story building for $3,000, the fist story of which was used for a
						chapel, and the upper story for a dormitory and the pastor's residence, for which three
						rooms were set aside. Father Stephan, the first priest in charge, remained until 1870.
						He was succeeded by: Rev. Henry Renson, about one year; Rev. August Young, from August
						16, 1869 to October 1871; Rev. Bernard Kroeger, from September 1872 till March 1, 1875;
						Rev. B. Hartmann, from March 1, 1875 till August 1876; Rev. Matthias Zumbuelte, from
						August 1876 till January 27, 1887.</p>

					<p>Father Kroeger erected a two-story building, where St. Joseph's College now stands; the
						lower story of which was used for a school and two rooms for hired men, and the second
						story served as a dormitory for the girls. The cost of this building was about

						<head rend="center b">1. ST. JOSEPH'S ASYLUM FOR BOYS.</head>

						<p>The Rev. George A. Hamilton, pastor of St. Mary's Church, Lafayette, who died April
							8, 1875, bequeathed in his will real estate and money to the value of about $10,000,
							for the establishment of a manual labor school for orphan boys, in the vicinity of
							Lafayette. The real estate included 580 acres, located between Lafayette and the
							Battle Grounds. This land had been devised to Father Hamilton by William B. Davis,
							better known as Indian Bill. Besides this gift, another donation of fifty-one acres of
							land south of Lafayette, was made by Owen Ball and J. B. Falley. On this land, Bishop
							Dwenger began the building of St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum for boys, in 1875. It is a
							four-story structure with a basement covering <pb id="VAB8203-479" n="479"/> an area
							of 121x113 feet; the tower of it rises to a height of seventy-five feet, and affords a
							fine view of the city and surrounding country. The cost was $33,000. In April 1876,
							thirty-five orphan boys from the asylum at Rensselaer took up their abode here, in
							charge of seven Sisters of the Holy Cross, Rev. B. Hartmann being the chaplain, who
							remained till July 1880. After him, the Rev. John H. Guendling had charge until July
							20, 1898, when he was succeded by his brother, the Rev. Charles B. Guendling, who has
							had the care of the institution since July 20, 1898. When the Sisters of the Holy
							Cross were recalled to Notre Dame, the Sisters of St. Francis, from the Mother-House
							at Lafayette, succeeded them at St. Joseph's Asylum in 1894.</p>

						<p>Additional ground of eighty acres was bought by Father John Guendling for $4,300.
							This tract of land lies due east of the Asylum, extending to Ninth street and the Big
							Four railway tracks on the south. Within the past four years a fine stretch of land on
							the west side has been reclaimed from the condition of a swamp, and is now known as
							the Orphan Park. The Ferry-boat and equipment with admiralty rights on navigable
							rivers was bought for $1,200. The Board of Works of the city of Lafayette donated the
							institution perpetual free water, and the promise of the city Fire Apparatus when
							needed.</p>

						<p>The house on the farm was enlarged to double its capacity. The Ferry received a new
							outfit of boat, cable, ropes and ferry-man's house, at a cost of $1,350. After much
							hard work and the expenditure of considerable money the Asylum is in first class
							condition, and the surroundings present an attractive appearance. In like manner the
							farm has improved and is also at the present time all that could be desired.</p>

						<p>Father Charles Guendling states that during the past twenty-seven years the cash
							maintenance of a child averages annually about $44.00; this includes clothing, shoes,
							schooling, medicine, board and lodging, amounting actually to about eleven cents a
							day. The Asylum has had under its roof about 1284 children; 163 were baptized, 487
							made their first Communion there and 385 were confirmed; and thirty-eight died. At the
							present time the Asylum has the care of 133 children. It has been estimated that the
							improvements and repairs <pb id="VAB8203-480" n="480"/> made by Father John Guendling
							amounted to $27,000, and those made by Father Charles Guendling aggregating the sum of

						<p>In the years 18'86 and 1887, the twenty-five acres of ground, located within the

					<p>The diocese of Fort Wayne is rich in hospitals conducted by religious communities. They

						Christian Charity and of the most generous support by Catholics and non-Catholics. All
						these hospitals are in a most flourishing condition. A list of them with a short sketch

								<hi rend="center">1869.</hi>
								<p>St. Joseph's Hospital, located on the corner of Main street and Broadway in Fort
									Wayne, was established on May 9, 1869. The building on this site, known as the
									Rock-hill Place was remodeled and is now a part of the hospital. The convent of
									the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ, their Mother-house in America, is in
									connection with the hospital, as also a normal school for the teaching Sisters.
									Additions have been made of the south wing, 130x30 feet in 1892 and in 1896 a
									fourth story was added to the old building for a spacious operating room, equipped
									with all modern conveniences. The hospital has a second operating room on the
									first floor of the south wing. The average number of patients is from 800 to 900
									annually. It is open to all, rich and poor, regardless of race, language or creed.
									The chaplains of the convent also attend to the spiritual needs of the patients.
									These chaplains have been three in number: Rev. Theodore Hibbelen till February 2,
									1886, Rev. <pb id="VAB8203-482" n="482"/> Julius Becks till December 3, 1889, and

								<hi rend="center">1875.</hi>
								<p>When the Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration entered upon their work of
									charity, they were unknown and without means. Until October 1876 they lived in a
									small house placed at their disposal, but on June 11, 1876 the corner stone of the
									beginning of St. Elisabeth's Hospital was laid on two lots donated by Albert
									Wagner. The east wing was added in 1879 and in 1883 the west wing and the chapel.
									So great was the demand made on the hospital that further additions became
									necessary in 1896 and were formally opened on January 6, 1897. The present
									imposing structure completing the original plans of the hospital was perfected in
									1905, when on December 31st Bishop Alerding solemnly dedicated the institution and
									the new chapel. The building is a substantial three story structure of brick and
									stone with basement and attic. The basement contains kitchen, dining rooms, and
									rooms for domestic purposes. On the first floor are the offices, parlors, private
									rooms and dispensary. On the second and third floors are dormitories and private
									rooms. All the floors are reached by elevator. The physicians' lavatory and
									operating room are thoroughly equipped. All the arrangements are modern and
									complete throughout. Patients are received without distinction as to creed, race
									or nationality, whether rich or poor.</p></item>

								<hi rend="center">1882.</hi>
								<p>St. Joseph's Hospital at South Bend was established October 20, 1882 in a
									building, which had been utilized for church and parochial school purposes. The
									increasing demands for hospital accommodations led to the erection of the present
									building, situated on one of the highest points of the city and commanding a
									beautiful view of the surrounding country. <pb id="VAB8203-483" n="483"/> The
									corner-stone was laid with becoming solemnity by Bishop Alerding, on April 26,
									1903. The new building was ready to receive patients in February 1905. The
									structure is of red pressed brick with stone trimmings, with a frontage of 156
									feet and a depth of 100 feet; the main building is three stories and the two wings
									two stories each in height. It has a capacity to accommodate 100 patients. The
									hospital is in every respect perfectly equipped for its purposes.</p>
								<p>The Sisters of the Holy Cross have charge of the institution.</p></item>

							<milestone unit="typography" n="---" rend="center"/>

							<item n="4."><hi rend="center b">ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL, AT LOGANSPORT.</hi>
								<hi rend="center">1893.</hi>
								<p>The Franciscan Sisters of Lafayette purchased the property, which they now occupy
									in Logansport for Hospital purposes, in the year 1893, for the sum of $10,000. The
									hospital began to receive patients on the 4th day of October of the same year.
									Twelve beds was all the accommodation the hospital had in the beginning, with
									Sister M. Adriana Superioress, and three nurses. In the first year of its
									existence the hospital treated within its walls 108 patients; twenty-four of whom
									paid in full, ten paid in part and seventy-four were charity patients. So great
									was the patronage given the hospital during the first year of its existence, that
									in 1894 the building had to be enlarged. The sum of $3,000 was spent on the
									addition and now the building can accommodate twice the original number of
									patients. The hospital has all the modern improvements in regard to heating,
									lighting and water. It has six private rooms, two wards, operating rooms, drug
									store, and other necessary adjuncts. The average number of patients treated
									annually up to the present time is about 270. Quite a number of the patients
									became converts to the Church.</p>
								<p>The Rev. J. A. Mark was the chaplain from 1897 till 1904. The present chaplain is
									the Rev. F. A. King. The usefulness of St. Joseph's Hospital is made evident by
									the increased patronage bestowed on it to such an extent, that preparations are
									being made for the erection of a new structure.</p></item>

							<item n="5."><hi rend="center b">ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL, AT ANDERSON.</hi>
								<hi rend="center">1894.</hi>
								<p>St. John's Hospital, at Anderson, owes its existence to Mr. John Hickey, a native
									of Ireland and a resident of Anderson, since 1853. It was founded in 1894, in
									which year, on March 31st, he deeded his homestead, situated between Jackson and
									Brown streets, to the Sisters of the Holy Cross. The frame building was repaired
									and remodeled, but proved to be too small to accommodate all the patients desiring
									admission. In consequence one wing of the present building was erected in 1895; it
									being constructed of brick, 72x45 feet, two stories high, costing about $9,000.
									The main building was erected in 1900 and cost $23,600. The dedication took place
									on October 21st, of the same year. The hospital contains forty rooms for patients,
									exclusive of the chaplain's apartments. In 1906 the old frame building was moved
									back of the main building, where it is now utilized as a laundry. The grounds
									consist of ten acres and have been much improved by paved streets, a drive-way,
									etc.</p>
								<p>Rev. D. J. Mulcahy, pastor of St. Mary's Church attended to the spiritual wants
									of the hospital till June 17, 1897, when Rev. Julius Becks was made the first
									resident chaplain, remaining till his death on March 14, 1902. Since then the
									institution is attended by the pastor or his assistant from St. Mary's Church.</p>
								<p>The success and growth of this hospital is due above all to the generosity of Mr.
									John Hickey, who made many donations including his final bequest by will, when he
									died on March 3, 1906; then to the city officials, the manufacturing companies,
									the merchants of Anderson, the members of the leading societies and clubs,
									religious and secular, the devoted physicians and surgeons of the city, the pastor
									and his assistants, and last but not least, to the zeal and hard work of the
									Sisters of the Holy Cross themselves.</p></item>

								<hi rend="center">1898.</hi>
								<p>St. Margaret's Hospital, conducted by the Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual
									Adoration, was opened on February 2, <pb id="VAB8203-485" n="485"/> 1898. The
									dwelling house, which stood on the site purchased for the hospital, was used at
									the time; it afforded room only for twenty patients. The growth and the prosperity
									of the city of Hammond, and the demand on the Sisters' charity, soon rendered the
									erection of a larger building imperative. The corner-stone of the present building
									was laid by Very Rev. John Guendling, Administrator of the diocese, on October 1,
									1899. The hospital has a measurement of 50x100 feet with four stories and a
									basement; the whole being equipped with all modern improvements. It can
									accommodate seventy patients. The solemn dedication took place on October 4, 1900.
									In 1904 additional grounds were purchased, so that the extension of the building
									when necessary can be made. A building, entirely apart from the main hospital, is
									used for patients afflicted with contagious diseases. Desirous to do the greatest
									good to the greatest number patients are received without distinction as to creed,
									race or nationality, the rich having no preference over the poor.</p></item>

								<p>The Holy Family Hospital at Laporte is conducted by Poor Handmaids of Jesus
									Christ. Its doors were opened to receive patients on March 1, 1900, with Sister
									Helena superioress and four assistants. The building, a frame structure was bought
									for $2,500 and to it a year later an addition of <pb id="VAB8203-486" n="486"/>
									thirty feet was made. In this way accommodations were secured for about twenty
									persons. Later on an adjoining lot, which had on it a small house, was acquired
									for $1,500. This house was occupied by the Sisters and served also for hospital
									kitchen. Having provided a heating system as well as lighting and water appliances
									the Sisters had an outlay altogether of about $11,000. During the six years of its
									existence this hospital has had the care of about 1000 patients, of whom one-half
									or one-third received treatment and shelter without remuneration. The
									accommodations fall far short of meeting the demands made for
								admission.</p></item>

								<p>Until the year 1901 Doctor W. Geiermann had been conducting a Kneipp Sanitarium
									at Rome City, a noted summer resort in Noble county. The Sisters of the Most
									Precious Blood secured this sanitarium by purchase in the year named. The
									dimensions of this institution at the time were very limited. The Sisters set to
									work at once to provide more room and better accommodations for the rapidly
									increasing number of patients. The new building was completed in the spring of
									1903, but before three years had elapsed, the completion of this structure
									according to original plans had become an imperative necessity. The sanitarium
									affords accommodations for upwards of 100 patients. One of the principal features
									of the institution is its beautiful chapel which has a seating capacity of 200.
									The chapel was dedicated by Bishop Alerding on June 21, 1903. Besides carefully
									attending to the wants of the patients the Sisters are also engaged in the
									perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Prayer and labor are the constant
									occupation of these devoted adorers of the Most Precious Blood.</p></item>

									located one square West of the church. Here the Sacred Heart Hospital was opened.
									Father Young gave the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart charge of it. The
									accommodations were found wholly insufficient and in 1902 the erection of a new
									hospital was begun. The dimensions are 40x120 feet, having a basement of eleven
									feet in the clear and over it two stories with two verandas the full length in the
									front and on the south side. It is one of the finest and best equipped hospitals
									of its size. Two additional lots adjoining were secured giving the hospital
									grounds a frontage of 150 feet with a depth of 125 feet. The value of the
									property, which has cost upward of $62,000 and which is clear of every
									indebtedness, was presented by Father Young to the Franciscan Sisters of the
									Sacred Heart, in July 1903. The name of Father Young is inscribed on the face of
									the corner-stone. The hospital was solemnly dedicated by Bishop Alerding on May
									17, 1903. The number of Sisters in charge of the hospital is ten, and during the
									year 1906, 303 patients were cared for.</p></item>

								<hi rend="center">1903.</hi>
								<p>In 1902 Mrs. John Bluett donated an entire block on Wabash street between Ripley
									and Anne streets, in Michigan City, to the Sisters of St. Francis of Lafayette,
									for the purposes of a hospital. The citizens of Michigan City, Catholic and
									non-Catholic, took a very general interest in the coming St. Anthony's Hospital,
									which the Sisters proposed to erect. A general subscription was taken to collect
									the necessary funds and a fair and a number of festivals were held to assist in
									the enterprise. The lady who donated the ground, and the Hon. John H. Barker who
									gave in cash $10,000, are the principal benefactors of the institution. The
									corner-stone was laid on October 9, 1903 and the building was dedicated on
									November 11, 1904 by Bishop Alerding, amid the concourse of a vast attendance of
									people. The cost of the building was $85,000. Sister Valeria the local superior
									was most active in bringing about the erection of St. Anthony's Hospital. Her
									noble life was brought to an abrupt conclusion in an accident caused by <pb

									structure with a basement, three stories and an attic, constructed of brick and
									stone. The basement has in it the kitchen, the dining rooms and rooms for domestic
									purposes. The first two floors have the offices, parlors, private rooms and
									dispensary. The third floor contains the chapel, private rooms and operating room

						<item n="1."><p>The Old People's Home at Avilla was founded in 1876, by Mother Anastasia
								(Bischler), a member of the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart. In consequence
								of the Kulturkampf in Germany, the community was banished from their native country.
								Rev. Dominic Duehimig assisted the Sisters in every way to secure their
								establishment at Avilla. A farm which had on it a frame building was bought from
								Thomas Storey, for $12,000. This house and a small chapel erected in the same year
								served the Sisters from 1876 until 1883. During this time the Sisters took care of a
								few old people and a number of orphans.</p>
							<p>The present Home, a brick building, was erected in 1895, and the old house was
								removed. The Home, as it stands at present, has necessitated an expense of $40,000;
								most of this money being furnished by the Mother-house at Joliet, Illinois. The
								building and the grounds answer the purpose for which they are intended in every
								respect.</p>
							<p>The first chaplain of the home was Rev. Joseph Flach, who, recently ordained, also
								emigrated from Germany on account of the persecution of Catholics raging there. He
								crossed the ocean with the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart, and arrived at
								Avilla in the year 1876, remaining there as chaplain till March 1878. From that date
								until 1896, the following priests were chaplains at the Home; Rev. B. Theodore Borg,
								Rev. John Hoss, Rev. Sebastian Ganther, C. PP. S. The present chaplain, Rev.
								Bernardine Abbink, O. S. F.. has been chaplain at the Home since April 29, 1896.</p>
							<p> Since 1896 one hundred and twenty-one old people have <pb id="VAB8203-490" n="490"

					<p><hi rend="i">Historical Review.</hi>-- No history of the diocese of Fort Wayne could be
						written without giving special prominence to a subject, which has been one of the main
						factors in the development of the diocese, and has always been its pride and glory,-the
						subject of Catholic education.</p>

					<p>At the advent of the first Bishop of Fort Wayne in 1857, Catholic education was already
						here and extended to him a hand of welcome. No greater consolation could have been
						offered to Monseigneur Luers, as he faced the difficulties of his early administration
						and gazed with anxious eye into the future, than the hopeful promise he could discern in
						the fact that already there were in his young diocese, schools for the elementary and
						secondary education of the rising generation, and priests and people filled with an
						ardent desire to promote the work already begun. There were only three schools and one
						college when he came, but under his wise leadership they rapidly increased in number and
						when he died there were in existence forty schools and a university.</p>

					<p>It is impossible to give full credit to this worthy Bishop, to the priests, teachers
						and people, who in those days of poverty and frightful struggle for the necessities of
						life, made such heroic sacrifices for the cause of Christian education, and made
						possible the advantages which we now enjoy.</p>

					<milestone unit="typography" n="---"/>
					<note id="note_009"><ref target="ref_009" rend="super">*</ref>By the Rev. A. E.
						Lafontaine, Diocesan Superintendent of Schools.</note>

					<pb id="VAB8203-492" n="492"/>

					<p>Bishop Luers encouraged the building of schools everywhere he went, and in purchasing
						sites for churches, always included a site for the school. He was so out-spoken in his
						advocacy of Christian and Catholic education for our people that he was often attacked
						in the public press. Many of his priests helped to build the schools out of their own
						scant means and even taught the schools themselves notwithstanding their arduous duties.
						The people were correspondingly generous, and we are thankful, for we realize how
						difficult it would have been later on to establish Catholic schools and mould Catholic
						opinion to the proper appreciation of Catholic training in a Catholic atmosphere if the
						youth of those days had been educated in the new public schools which were just then
						springing up over the entire state. Other dioceses had to create their Catholic system
						of education in the presence of a well developed system of public instruction, with its
						many material advantages, and history tells us under what enormous difficulties they
						labored and how the most earnest desires and energetic efforts of zealous Bishops were
						thwarted for years.</p>

					<p>The schools of course labored under many disadvantages; the buildings were small and
						poorly suited to their purpose, the furnishings were of the most crude character and
						conveniences of all kinds were conspicuous by their absence. Sometimes the pupils were
						taught in the Church or in the house of the pastor. It was impossible to have long terms
						and more impossible still to exercise any choice in regard to the teachers, some of whom
						were men without professional training, whose main recommendation was their ability to
						instruct the choir and play the organ. Some were far from being models to the children
						they had to teach, others, however, be it noted, were men one would hardly expect to
						find in a calling so poorly remunerated in those days, graduates of a college or
						university eminently fitted to teach any school by their profound knowledge and splendid
						character. But these men it was hard to keep. They passed on to positions more suited to
						their attainments and the difficulties with regard to teachers in our elementary schools
						were only gradually overcome by the arrival in the diocese of the different Sisterhoods
						on whom we now depend and have depended ever since.</p>

					<p>Bishop Luers was taken away suddenly on June 29, 1871, <pb id="VAB8203-493" n="493"/>
						and was succeeded by Bishop Dwenger, a man in his prime, of vigorous mind and body, who
						devoted his splendid talents, strong convictions, boundless enthusiasm and indefatigable
						energy to continue the work so auspiciously begun under his predecessor. He became in
						truth the champion of Catholic education and was incessant in his urgings to his priests
						to gather the children of their own parishes into schools of their own, to protect them
						against the evil influences of Godless schools, to preserve them in their innocence, and
						simplicity of heart, to enlighten their minds with supernatural knowledge and to fire
						their hearts with sincere love for God, Church and country. His motto was, "Catholic
						schools for Catholic children." A frequent expression of his was: "Catholic schools now
						or empty churches a few years hence." He urged the Catholic people to make their
						rallying cry and leading principle: "Good parochial schools and a free Catholic
						education for our children."</p>

					<p>During his administration the diocese made wonderful progress; new churches and
						parochial residences were erected and in many places the inadequate frame school
						buildings were replaced by commodious brick edifices. In the parishes in which it was
						impossible to build a separate church and school house, the churches were built in two
						stories, the lower one serving as a school.</p>

					<p>In order to promote the success of education, he established a school board in 1879,
						giving to the diocese a distinction enjoyed by none other, if we except Rochester,
						before the Council of Baltimore. He also advocated the establishment of high schools and
						in a strong letter, he even commanded that central high schools for boys be erected in
						the large cities, through the common efforts of the different parishes. So successful
						was he in his zealous endeavors that when he was taken away, all too soon, and we might
						say still a young man, there were seventy schools and several academies in his
						diocese.</p>

					<p>A few quotations will serve to set in relief his convictions on the subject of Catholic
						education.</p>

					<p><q>"When we foster a generation of good, practical intelligent Catholics, we secure all
							the elements required to discharge every duty commanded by Holy Church and to fulfill
							all the works of charity implied in the Catholic name."</q>
						<q>"The Catholic <pb id="VAB8203-494" n="494"/> school should be looked upon as an
							essential and integral part of the church and hence the necessary expense for its
							support should be defrayed by the congregation in general."</q>
						<q>"In the teaching of the secular branches required in the ordinary affairs of life,
							the parochial schools of the diocese must not allow themselves to be excelled by any
							institution of similar grade in the land."</q>
						<q>"Catholics should be taught to understand and feel that the school is an integral
							part of the church, yea, in our age and country the very foundation thereof. They
							should be taught to understand and feel in their consciences that it is as necessary
							to have a good Catholic school to give their children a good Catholic education, as it
							is to have a Church, divine service and the word of God preached to them. It is a most
							sacred duty of parents to send their children to a Catholic school where such exists
							in their midst. Neither guilty parents neglecting to do this, nor willing children
							frequenting the Godless public school instead of going to the Catholic school, may
							receive the sacraments. If they do receive absolution from a strange priest by
							concealing the truth they commit a sacrilege. This duty of Catholics is so plainly
							taught by reason, by Sacred Scriptures, by the numerous decisions of Popes and
							Councils that there can be no doubt of it. We refer to the words of St. Paul, that he
							who neglects those of his household has denied the faith and is worse than an
							infidel."</q></p>

					<p><q>"There can be no doubt that in our age and especially in our country our youth will
							lose their religion unless they are thoroughly instructed in Catholic schools. The
							dangers to religion are so great and so manifold that unless we prepare our children
							well they will certainly fail. If we allow the pure fertile field of their innocent
							hearts to become covered with weeds, it will be almost useless to sow afterward the
							seed of our holy faith. If they grow up as heathens it will be very hard or impossible
							to convert them. Children who have to answer the fierce and constant warfare waged
							against our holy faith, must be well instructed and disciplined. In this contest the
							school is as necessary as the Church and in its peculiar place even more so. Our work
							is not perfect, but we can work and work we will cheerfully and harmoniously for the
							greatest and most important object of the present time-- Catholic <pb id="VAB8203-495"
								n="495"/> Education."</q> His interest in school matters and great foresight appear
						in what follows: <q>"I fully agree that the frequent change of teachers is a great evil.
							It takes a long time before a new teacher learns the antecedent qualifications, the
							disposition and talents of the scholars. The period during which a new teacher is
							making a reputation in the school room is always a critical period, the seldomer the
							experiment is tried the better for the schools. I am aware, however, that there are
							occasions, when even good teachers belonging to a religious community must be changed,
							but I have always expressed the opinion that such changes should be made only when
							very necessary and as seldom as possible. It is our wish, therefore, that wherever
							possible steps be at once taken to provide for graded schools. In towns and cities of
							two or more Congregations, this can be done without any very great difficulty. Very
							few Congregations, even in large cities can support the different grades or
							departments required to give an advanced education; but by all the Congregations
							within a suitable distance uniting and supporting one advanced school, this great want
							can be supplied and the work can be done far better than is now sometimes attempted by
							divided and single-handed efforts. This necessity appears to be more pressing in
							regard to schools for advanced boys: and it is plain, that as our people acquire more
							wealth whereby they will be enabled to send their boys longer to school and require a
							higher grade of education than heretofore, this necessity will become more pressing
							and at the same time far more disastrous. Wherever then, in towns and cities it may be
							possible to establish a high school, priests should unite and work hand in hand to
							found and support such a school. This is our wish, this is our positive
						order."</q></p>

					<p>Bishop Rademacher succeeded Bishop Dwenger in October, 1893. He continued the policy of
						his predecessor concerning the schools, which continued to grow in numbers and increase
						in efficiency. During the first five years of his administration sixteen new schools
						were built, at an expense of over forty thousand dollars. He never spared himself when
						the interests of education were at stake and in spite of his arduous labors he would
						travel the length and breadth of his diocese, in order to encourage by his presence the
						efforts of the children at their commencement exercises. His splendid character and many
							<pb id="VAB8203-496" n="496"/> most amiable qualities gained the deep love of his
						priests and they vied with each other in their efforts to satisfy his every wish.</p>

					<p>He was succeeded by the present Bishop, Right Rev. H. J. Alerding who became
						immediately known among the Priests as a most ardent school man. He found the Diocese no
						longer in its infancy, with the tide of immigration spent, and the schools therefore,
						could not be expected to increase in numbers by leaps and bounds as in the past.
						Nevertheless, under his loving and paternal care, his wise direction and enthusiastic
						devotion to the cause, the schools have improved their condition, have become more
						perfectly organized, and have vastly increased in efficiency.</p>

					<p>As a proof of his tender solicitude in this regard, he wrote a pastoral letter on
						vocation to the religious state. Among other things he says: "It is they (who enter the
						religious state), next to the priests who keep alive the faith and quicken the spiritual
						life of the Church. Pastors of souls will readily testify of what immense influence for
						good these religious are in parishes. Indeed, what would become of our schools if we had
						not these teachers. The vows they have taken qualify them in character and the special
						training received makes them the best educators for our children. The providence of God
						has given the Church these religious communities as an endowment upon which no money
						value can be put. There is not money enough on earth to furnish one religious. God's
						vocation alone and His grace together with faithful cooperation can train these
						religious, both brothers and sisters. <milestone unit="typography" n="***"/> I wish to
						bring to your notice that the Church is being hampered in her work of educating her
						youth because the number of teachers, brothers and sisters is inadequate.</p>

					<p><q><p>"We have evidence that Catholic education has at last become the concerted work
								of the Church in this country. The schools are increasing everywhere, new schools
								are being organized and the attendance at the schools already existing is increasing
								wonderfully year by year. This is as it should be. Yet, though the work is
								increasing, the number of the workers is not increasing in proportion. The cry all
								over the land is: WE MUST HAVE MORE BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO TEACH OUR SCHOOLS. To
								carry on the <pb id="VAB8203-497" n="497"/> work of high schools for boys, the
								number of brothers is woefully deficient, out of all proportion to the number
								needed."</p></q></p>

					<p><hi rend="i">School Board.</hi>-- In 1879 Bishop Dwenger desiring to improve the
						condition of the schools and create a diocesan system, at the instance of Rev. J. H.
						Oechtering and the Rev. M. O'Reilly, established a diocesan school board composed of the
						following members: Very Rev. J. Benoit, President, Rev. M. O'Reilly, Secretary, Rev. W.
						Corby, C. S. C., Rev. E. Koenig, Rev. J. Rademacher, Rev. H. Meissner, Rev. J. H.
						Oechtering. The board resolved to prepare an annual report for the following reasons,
						which they expressed to the Bishop: <q>"By means of a well prepared annual report, Right
							Rev. Bishop, it will be in your power to perceive at a glance what is being done for
							the education of Catholic youth in your diocese. In your hands are placed statistics
							from the most humble as well as the more opulent localities under your jurisdiction,
							which may justify a timely reproof or elicit a word of encouraging approbation. You
							can learn where zeal begins to flag, or where charity begins to grow cold; for with
							indifference toward the Catholic education of youth begins the moral death of the
							Congregation. The Clergy of the diocese will be able to compare the effects of their
							charitable labors with those of their neighbors. The people are by no means
							indifferent to their best interests, and when they are once led to apprehend the
							untold blessings of a good Catholic school, the most difficult part of the Pastor's
							labor is ended."</q></p>

					<p>The Board also at the first meeting, considered the question of text books which they
						termed deplorably irregular, but did not deem it judicious to prescribe a uniform set of
						text books and command an immediate change. They thought the solution of this question
						should be left to the good judgment of the Pastors and Teachers for some years at least.
						A statistical report of forty-four schools giving the number of pupils, the number of
						teachers, the text books and the branches studied was published. A perusal of this
						report shows how much the schools differed from each other, and showed the wisdom of
						trying to gather these scattered units under diocesan direction. In its yearly reports
						the School Board turned its attention to the different phases of school work and made
						many valuable suggestions and attempted much needed reforms.</p>

					<pb id="VAB8203-498" n="498"/>

					<p>Among the topics discussed and recommended were the necessity of establishing a system
						of examination for secular teachers, <q><p>"we plainly see that the power for good, a
								well qualified teacher, should have in the Congregation and school room, is
								neutralized and more or less inoperative until he or she can exhibit the voucher of
								competency witnessed by the Episcopal seal. This cannot be brought about effectively
								and with all the exterior evidences of thoroughness and impartiality until the
								general system of examination is adopted, that must pass, in all its details, under
								the impartial eye of Episcopal jurisdiction.</p>
							<p>"The necessity of avoiding too frequent changes of teachers.</p>
							<p>"Next to a high grade of qualifications in a teacher the most important point to be
								considered affecting the well-being of our schools, is, change of teachers. It is a
								high encomium on the ability of the many teachers employed in the diocesan schools
								up to the present time, when we assure you that for the one injury done by not
								promptly removing an incompetent teacher, ninety-nine evils have arisen from changes
								without apparent cause.</p>
							<p>"The division of the Diocese into districts.</p>
							<p>"We hope that you may consider the time near at hand when you can divide the
								diocese into districts, over each of which, you will appoint a competent priest,
								whose duty it will be to visit the schools, preside at examinations, and assist the
								School Board in carrying out your plans for the general good.</p>
							<p>"The establishment of graded schools.</p>
							<p>"However remote the completion of your hopes may be, in regard to establishing
								graded schools in towns and cities containing two or more Congregations, we would
								deem it very important should you be pleased to permit your views on the subject to
								be published for the instruction of all those, who may be expected to engage in this
								important undertaking.</p>
							<p>"Course of study for the Parochial Schools.</p>
							<p>"There are many reasons why this idea should be reduced to practice. Pastors and
								teachers will have an outline of the studies expected to be pursued in the Parish
								Schools. Parents will be enabled to see what their children should have accomplished
								before they can be justly taken away from school, and pupils themselves will be able
								to determine their own standing <pb id="VAB8203-499" n="499"/> in the course, and
								will be thereby encouraged to complete with honor the few years' order of study
								outlined for them. There will be always some exceptions to the best devised plans,
								but it is thought that a moderate and well arranged course of study presented to the
								schools, and followed as far as practicable will result in more general good than
								anything that may follow from the irregularity and indefiniteness that now pervades
								our schools. We present the following course for our parochial schools, not making
								it of obligation but indicative of what should be attempted to be done:</p>
							<p rend="center">PRIMARY GRADE.</p>
							<p>"First Year, I.-- Age of children 6 to 7 years.</p>
							<p>"Charts, primer, phonic spelling, primary spelling, first reader, drawing and
								printing or writing on slates. Verbal religious instructions.</p>
							<p>"Second Year II.-- Age of children 7 to 8 years.</p>
							<p>"Phonic spelling, verbal orthography, elementary arithmetic, second reader, drawing
								and printing or writing on slates. Verbal religious instructions.</p>
							<p>"Third Year III.-- Age of children 8 to 9 years.</p>
							<p>"Verbal and written orthography, mental arithmetic, primary arithmetic with book
								and slate, oral elementary geography, third reader. Catechism.</p>
							<p rend="center">INTERMEDIATE GRADE.</p>
							<p>"Fourth Year I.-- Age of children 9 to 10 years.</p>
							<p>"Verbal and written orthography, arithmetic, mental and practical; oral grammar,

							<p>"Verbal and written orthography, simple dictation exercises, No. 2 geography,
								intermediate grammar, arithmetic, mental and practical, penmanship, fourth reader,
								catechism.</p>
							<p>"Sixth Year III.-- First Communion Year-Age of children 11 to 12 years.</p>
							<p>"Written orthography, daily; No. 2 geography completed, intermediate grammar
								completed, arithmetic, mental and practical; sacred history, dictation exercises,
								fifth reader, catechism.</p>
							<pb id="VAB8203-500" n="500"/>
							<p rend="center">SENIOR GRADE.</p>
							<p>"Seventh Year I.-- Age of children 12 to 13 years.</p>
							<p>"Written orthography daily; grammar school speller, arithmetic, mental and
								practical completed, No. 3 geography, advanced grammar, sacred history, physiology
								(optional), original composition weekly, fifth reader, catechism.</p>
							<p>"Eighth Year II.-- Confirmation Year.-Age of children 13 to 14 years.</p>
							<p>"Grammar school speller completed, grammar completed (not including prosody), No. 3
								geography completed, physiology (optional), U. S. History with written reviews of
								each lesson, percentage reviewed, bookkeeping (single entry), letter writing weekly;
								catechism."</p>
						</q>
					</p>

					<p>It will be noticed that this course of study divided the school period into eight years
						and three grades and defined the subjects to be pursued in the schools of the diocese.
						This was a valuable help, no doubt, in the establishment of more systematic study in the
						schools, and answered the purpose expressed by the members of the board of a line of
						separation between the Parochial schools and High schools. It also helped the children
						to know their position in the school and how many years they would be required to
						attend. As a course of study, however, its vagueness would prevent rather than assist
						uniformity in the schools, as each different teacher would be free to interpret the
						amount to be learned in each grade according to his own ideas. This may be easily seen
						by comparison of any topic, say arithmetic in the fourth, fifth and sixth years.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">School Visitors.</hi>-- Another very important matter was the division of
						the diocese into school districts and the appointment of priests to act as visitors. In
						1882, six districts were created under the supervision of the Very Rev. J. Benoit, Rev.
						E. Koenig, Rev. John Oechtering and Rev. F. Koerdt, for the first district; of Rev.
						Henry Meissner for the second district; of Rev. E. P. Walters for the third; of Rev.
						Joseph Rademacher for the fourth; of Rev. August Oechtering for the fifth; of Rev. M.
						O'Reilly for the sixth. These Reverend Fathers were supposed to visit the schools
						assigned to them at least once a year and to render a report in writing to the School
						Board at its annual meeting. Their annual reports were to cover every <pb
							id="VAB8203-501" n="501"/> point pertaining to the improvement of the schools, the
						qualifications of teachers, the progress and standing of pupils, the state of school
						buildings, the conveniences in the school rooms, the play-grounds and surroundings. In
						1883 the School Board expressed the opinion that nothing could promise more valuable
						benefits than the division of the diocese into school districts and the appointment of
						school visitors. However, in that year there were no reports of the visitors, and it was
						decided to grant them another year's experience. As was to be expected there was
						difficulty in obtaining complete and correct reports from the schools and Bishop Dwenger
						referred to the matter in the following terms: "The Bishop can command and does command
						that this duty be performed and the Bishop will personally take cognizance thereof and
						enforce it." At the meeting of the School Board in October, 1885, the "Visitors"
						presented a report showing the result of their work in visiting each school assigned
						them and holding examinations. These reports made manifest that the schools of the
						diocese were in a satisfactory condition. They informed the Board that in a number of
						instances these examination days were made a sort of holiday for the parents, who
						crowded into the halls and school rooms and manifested quite an interest in the
						proceedings and looked with much pleasure upon the invitation of their pastor to attend
						the school examinations. The Board, however, resolved not to publish the reports of the
						visitors. An interesting item is the following: <q>"The school visitors of the several
							districts were unanimous in asking the Board to recommend in their report to the Right
							Rev. Bishop, that teachers should seek to keep the entire school occupied; and that
							whilst one portion of the school was engaged in recitation, the other portion shall be
							engaged in preparing a lesson."</q> Another topic discussed was the system, now so
						much in vogue in many of our schools, of loading the child with too many lessons to be
						learned at home in the evening. At this meeting of the Board it was decided to publish
						two pedagogical articles to be prepared by members of the Board, one on Principles of
						Education and one on School Punishments, and at the same time it was resolved not to
						publish the reports of the examiners in a yearly pamphlet as had been the intention, but
						to submit them to the Bishop alone for perusal.</p>

					<pb id="VAB8203-502" n="502"/>

					<p>The zeal of the School Board, therefore, did a great deal for the schools of the
						diocese, but it desired to do more. The schools were improving certainly, but each one
						in its own way; there was no unity in standard, grading, studies or text.</p>

					<p>The visit of the examiner was announced beforehand and prepared for, and all he could
						do was to attest that the children knew the matter which had been prepared. What
						branches had been studied did not depend on him; whether they were suited to the grade
						or to the age of the children and what method was used in imparting them were questions
						outside of his province; in fact, all the many problems of school management were to him
						as a closed book. If the efficiency of the work were to be increased the Board felt that
						a system should be created which would not only look at the child on examination day,
						but would inquire scientifically into all the problems which make for real progress in
						education and which would influence for the better all the schools of the diocese at the
						same time, and all the time.</p>

					<p>Finally in the fifteenth annual report of the School Board a suggestion of the greatest
						importance was made to the Right Rev. Bishop: <q type="blockquote"><p>It must be to your
								Lordship an ever growing pleasure to note the constantly increasing zeal of Pastors
								and Teachers. Still you will also realize the necessity and great value of greater
								concentration in school affairs and a more homogeneous curriculum in our schools.
								Our Priests, it is true, are eminently qualified to direct the work of education in
								their respective parishes. Before their ordination many years were spent in studying
								under capable instructors, thus leaving the ecclesiastical seminary thoroughly
								educated men. Their knowledge too is not altogether theoretical; for all through
								their course it received a practical turn. Their zeal for souls impels them to study
								the latest and most improved methods of imparting the truths of religion and the
								facts of science to the youthful mind. They enter their respective schools with a
								mind stored with knowledge and a heart full of affection for the children committed
								to their charge. As they move from class to class encouraging the diffident, urging
								on the slothful, rewarding the deserving, cheering the despondent, correcting the
								wayward, their influence for good is felt by the entire school and <pb
									id="VAB8203-503" n="503"/> parish, young and old coming to regard them as their
								benefactor, their Father and their friend. In spite of these facts, experienced
								Priests acknowledge with all sincerity, that the many onerous parochial duties do
								not give them sufficient time for the proper study of school matters. Hence, both
								the utility and necessity of assigning this work to some efficient and experienced
								Priest, who would not be burdened with parochial cares, in whom the Pastors had
								confidence and to whom they would yield obedience in school matters. Who could study
								methods and books; who could bring about concentration and supervision. Father
								Shanahan, Superintendent of Parochial schools at Philadelphia, says: <q>'This is the
									only way by which we can compete with and surpass public schools. Only those
									ignorant of the benefit of a definite system and uniformity in the methods of
									teaching, underrating the arduous duties of teachers with the concomitant
									difficulties will insist that each Pastor should run the school to suit
									himself.'</q></p>
							<p>"Eminent and experienced men of the School Boards of other dioceses acknowledge:
								'The end aimed at by the institution of school boards, viz: A higher standard of
								education among our children, will not be reached until the matter is placed in the
								hands of one man, a Priest whose sole occupation will be to busy himself about the
								schools, a system which has been adopted and works most satisfactorily in Boston,
								Philadelphia, Brooklyn and Rochester.' Hence the School Board would repeat its
								request of last July, that we may come to a proper course of study for city and
								country schools, that several years be given for the preparation thereof and in
								compiling the same the schedules for studies for elementary schools, followed by the
								various teaching orders of the diocese be carefully examined and
						followed."</p></q></p>

					<p>To this proposition of the School Board to appoint a diocesan Superintendent for the
						schools of the diocese, Bishop Rademacher gave his hearty approval, regretting, however,
						that the project would have to be delayed for sometime.</p>

					<p>On account of his sickness and death, the subject was not resumed for several years,
						and it was not until 1901 that Bishop Alerding, at a meeting of the School Board,
						finally decided to appoint Rev. A. E. Lafontaine to the position.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">Appointment of Superintendent.</hi>-- The new Superintendent <pb
							id="VAB8203-504" n="504"/> was directed to become acquainted with the conditions of
						the schools of the diocese during that year and to report to the Board at the next
						meeting.</p>

					<p>After a careful visit of the schools he found that in spite of the recommendations of
						the School Board a great deal had to be done in the work of organization and
						systematization. Many schools were not graded, those that were did not agree in the
						number of grades nor in the branches to be studied. Often the teacher classified the
						pupils according to his own ideas or according to first, second, third or fourth reader.
						In fact, there was an almost total lack of unity and each school was a law unto
						itself.</p>

					<p>In regard to method too many teachers required the pupils to memorize by heart the
						lessons of the text book and to recite word for word.</p>

					<p>The text books also were unnecessarily multiplied. It was soon realized that the
						position of Superintendent was one of great difficulty and responsibility. On account of
						his relation to the teachers and pupils on the one hand and to the Bishop and School
						Board on the other, the position was like the keystone of the educational arch. He would
						have to be examiner, inspector, and superintendent all in one. As examiner he would have
						to be able to inquire intelligently into and determine all matters pertaining to the
						qualifications of teachers and pupils. As inspector, he would have to be able to
						ascertain the quality of the teaching, the character of the management, detect whatever
						might be wrong in matter or method and point out the means of correction. As
						superintendent, he would have to be able to oversee carefully, advise wisely and direct
						intelligently. The best schools of the Union would have to be visited, the latest
						developments in pedagogy studied, the best text books considered and chosen.</p>

					<p>The intention of the School Board was to allow him several years to prepare plans for
						his work, but it was recognized that it would take years in any case to produce tangible
						results even with prompt action. As soon as possible, therefore, a program was prepared
						of which the following is a summary: A uniform course of study.-- Uniform
						examinations.-- Exhibits of the work of the pupils.-- Co-operation of religious orders
						in inspection.-- Reliable statistics by means of daily registers and <pb
							id="VAB8203-505" n="505"/> teachers' reports.-- Means to influence the normal training
						given to the teachers.-- Greater uniformity in text books.-- Improved methods of
						teaching.-- Regulation of the daily program.-- Exact determination of the limits of the
						grammar schools and high school entrance requirements.-- Means to obtain high schools
						covering a complete course equal to that of the state and satisfactory to the Catholic
						colleges.</p>

					<p>This program discussed before the School Board and approved by the Bishop was the first
						step in the reorganization and is still in process of development.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">Course of Study.</hi>-- The course of study for the grammar schools in the
						diocese has been divided into eight grades, allowing one year to each grade. In some
						schools the first grade is given more than a year. Six months or less are allowed to
						what is called the primary class. Throughout all the other grades, the time allotted is
						practically followed.</p>

					<p>The branches to be taught comprise: Catechism and bible history, reading, spelling,
						arithmetic, geography, history, grammar, penmanship, nature study, physiology, vocal
						music, drawing, literature, algebra, bookkeeping, and art as derived from the greatest
						paintings of the world.</p>

					<p>The main object of the course is not only to fit the child thoroughly for high school
						work, but to provide for the case which so frequently happens, in which the grammar
						school is the end of the child's schooling. It endeavors to give him all that he
						requires to earn an honest living in the world of industry; it provides for his
						religious and moral instruction and pays great care to his culture and refinement.</p>

					<p>The subjects to be taken up in each grade are prescribed by the diocese; they are also
						outlined with sufficient detail to direct the teacher in the attainments which he is to
						require from his pupils. Too much detail, however, is avoided in order to preserve some
						elasticity in the course, in order to meet the different conditions of numbers or
						grades. No subject is really optional, but in certain cases, what are called
						fundamentals are temporarily given precedence.</p>

					<p>The teachers are not allowed to give instruction in the matters not pertaining to their
						grade. When teachers have different grades in a room, they are allowed to hold combined
							<pb id="VAB8203-506" n="506"/> recitations in certain subjects, whenever by so doing
						they may save time without detriment to the pupils.</p>

					<p>Although the religious instruction is left under the direct supervision of the Pastor,
						it is the duty of the teachers to create a religious atmosphere and to permeate all the
						daily studies with the spirit of religion.</p>

					<p>The teachers are considered the best judges in matters pertaining to the promotion of
						the pupils, but in cases where the school has a principal charged with supervision of
						the classes, classification and promotion are within his province.</p>

					<p>When a child is seriously deficient in any of the branches, he should not be promoted
						to the next grade. However, he should not be kept in one grade longer than two
						years.</p>

					<p>Children of the eighth grade who desire to be formally recognized by the diocese as
						graduates of the grammar schools are obliged to pass a written examination given by the
						Superintendent. If they pass this examination in a satisfactory manner and receive
						testimonials of scholarship and good conduct from their teacher and Pastor, they receive
						a diploma, which entitles them to entrance into any of our high schools, and gives
						formal testimony to the fact that they have completed in all its branches the grades
						prescribed by the diocese.</p>

					<p>In order to determine whether the course meets with success or failure in actual
						practice, and also to maintain uniformity in the different grades in all the schools of
						the diocese, a written examination is given by the Superintendent in April of each year.
						The value of these examinations resides not only in the information which they give
						concerning the knowledge of the students, but in the fact that they reveal the different
						methods in use and their comparative worth, covering as they do the entire work of the
						school. They reveal the habits of thought, of industry and of thoroughness of both the
						pupils and teachers. They furnish permanent records for the guidance of the
						Superintendent and for discussion with the teachers. They enable the Board to pass
						judgment on the standards of the different schools and they show the interpretation
						given to the subjects of the course.</p>

					<p>This course of study under proper supervision has been the occasion of incalculable
						improvement in the schools of the <pb id="VAB8203-507" n="507"/> diocese taken as a
						whole. Even schools laboring under extra-ordinary difficulties have advanced in a
						remarkable manner. Some, for example, which five years ago graduated pupils with the
						bare rudiments of English grammar, offered this year candidates for the diploma who
						passed without difficulty an examination in English, which comprised not only the
						complete grammar with punctuation and prosody, but a thorough literary study of several
						standard authors.</p>

					<p>Others that have been satisfied with common fractions in their higher grades, today are
						teaching algebra and book-keeping. While still others who thought it impossible to teach
						anything but catechism, reading, writing and arithmetic are now taking with pleasure and
						success all the other branches including the so-called culture studies.</p>

					<p>It is not to be denied that special studies such as hygiene, music, nature and art work
						present some difficulty and the work is not carried out in all the schools as it should
						be, but the progress is constant and the future is promising.</p>

					<p>Of course no curriculum of study may remain the same for many years in a progressive
						school system, and the course prepared by the diocese will naturally undergo many
						changes, but these changes will rarely be radical and will be made only when required by
						necessity and after thorough discussion with the teaching body and when experience will
						have shown that the subjects introduced have passed the experimental stage and give
						assurance of solid benefits.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">Supervision.</hi>-- The Superintendent is expected to visit the schools
						personally as often as possible. The teachers are supposed to teach in his presence
						whatever subject may be assigned to them and in that way he studies their manner and
						method as well as their fitness. He also examines the pupils either orally or by written
						work. When he finds defects in organization or method he points them out afterward and
						keeps a note of them. He offers suggestions for improvement also. As the work of all the
						teachers of a community is generally very similar, he often finds that a remark made to
						the community inspector or to the Superior General has a wide reaching influence.</p>

					<p>In order to obtain perfect records of attendance, daily registers have been prepared by
						the aid of which each teacher <pb id="VAB8203-508" n="508"/> is enabled at the end of
						the scholastic year to furnish an accurate report covering the following items: Number
						of pupils enrolled.-- Average attendance.-- Average age.-- Number of days school was in
						session.-- How the course of study is followed or modified.-- If the authorized text
						books are used.-- Number of years experience.-- Number of years or months in the present
						school.-- Number of grades taught.-- Number of pupils in each grade.-- Number of visits
						of inspector.-Number of visits of superintendent.-- Number of visits of pastor.-- Number
						of maps and globes.-Area of blackboard.-How often the school is swept.-- How often
						scrubbed.-- How often the walls are cleaned.-- How many hours are taught daily.-- How
						many days the school was in session.-- What suggestions they wish to make in the
						interests of the schools.-- How they have divided and worked out their daily program.--
						How many hours given to each subject weekly.</p>

					<p>On account of the number of schools, of the large size of the diocese and of the many
						duties of the superintendent, his visits must necessarily be infrequent and short. This
						is a serious drawback to efficient supervision. In order to counteract this defect, the
						superintendent recommended one remedy that could be successfully adopted, namely, that
						the religious communities be invited to appoint from among their experienced teachers,
						inspectors with the duty of visiting and examining their schools. With only a few
						schools to visit, they could spend sufficient time in the class rooms to become
						thoroughly acquainted with all their phases. Being in such close touch with the Sisters
						of their own order, they could express the actual sentiments and views of the teachers
						and could furnish the superintendent with all the information necessary, to devise means
						to produce the greatest harmony and solidarity in the whole system. If this plan could
						be followed we would have eleven or twelve inspectors and the organization and
						supervision of our schools would be almost perfect.</p>

					<p>For the reports of these inspectors a form was prepared embracing the following
						questions: What is the number of pupils in each grade?-- Their average age.-- What is
						their standing in the different subjects?-- What is their deportment?-- What is the
						general impression?-- What is the condition of the school in regard to floor, ceiling
						and walls, windows and <pb id="VAB8203-509" n="509"/> doors, heating, ventilation, desks
						and seats, blackboards, maps, globes and charts?-- What are the conditions of the
						grounds, water supply, etc.?-- What are the improvements needed in the school?-- What
						are the names of the teachers?-- What are the remarks which they wish to suggest as a
						result of their inspection?-- What was the date of their visit?</p>

					<p>Unfortunately only a few communities have been able so far to accede to this desire,
						but all favor it and there is reason to believe that in a short time it will be
						satisfied.</p>

					<p>Parents are also kept advised of the progress of their children by means of monthly
						reports.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">Training of Teachers.</hi>-- Accepting the dictum: "As the teacher is, so
						is the school," the Superintendent made an effort to control or influence the
						examinations of the teachers. The object was not to inquire into their academic
						training, because almost without exception, our teachers are perfectly well equipped in
						the knowledge of the subjects which they are to teach, but to enable the Diocese to give
						direction in the special technical training in the science and art of teaching. He was
						convinced that only good could come to the body of schools, if our young teachers were
						given reasonable regulations and wise directions concerning the study of psychology and
						child study, the history of education, methods of teaching, school management, school
						law, practice work and philosophy of education, because it is a great source of
						suffering to the teacher to be obliged to grope in the dark until he has learned the art
						of his calling through bitter experience, and the child shares in the agony.</p>

					<p>While there is no immediate examination of the teachers by the Diocese, it must not be
						inferred that the teachers' training is neglected; on the contrary in most of the
						communities, it is tended to with great care and in a most practical manner. This is the
						way it is carried out in one of the best organized communities. The future teachers
						having completed the high school course, receive special training for two years during
						the novitiate, and if obliged on account of the scarcity of teachers to take a class
						before the two years have elapsed, they must return to the training school as soon as
						they are free. After the novitiate they receive each year, five weeks normal training
						under experienced teachers, in <pb id="VAB8203-510" n="510"/> matters pertaining to the
						grades with which they are working, and at the end of the five weeks they must pass a
						written examination. This institute work and written examination is taken by all the
						teachers every year, until they have had twenty-live years experience, after which time
						they are excused.</p>

					<p>During the institute time, besides the regular course, they attend once a week lectures
						given by prominent educators of the United States, and for thirty minutes every morning
						they listen to the criticisms or commendations and special directions of the community
						inspector, who has visited their schools throughout the year.</p>

					<p>Such a system evidently insures learned, competent and practical teachers. It also
						acquaints them thoroughly with the most advanced thought in education. It is also a
						deadly enemy to routine.</p>

					<p>Other communities although perhaps less perfectly organized, fully recognize the
						importance of trained teachers and give the subject the most serious attention, and as
						much time as circumstances will permit. Some of the communities also send their most
						promising pupils or candidates to the State normal school in order that they may be
						acquainted with the methods in use.</p>

					<p>The Superintendent also exercises a direct influence on the teachers by addresses and
						meetings, by criticisms and encouragement, by bringing before them the practice of the
						best teachers, by showing the work of the pupils of the best schools to those less
						advanced, and by introducing to their notice whatever may give variety or interest to
						their teaching.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">Organization of the Schools.</hi>-- A parochial grammar school must be
						erected in every parish and the proper means for its support must be devised. The pastor
						who neglects this important duty renders himself liable to removal. It is for the Bishop
						to decide whether in given cases, exception can be made. In this Diocese the school
						system consists of parish schools, high schools and academies, colleges and one
						university.</p>

					<p>The parish schools and high schools are organically connected by means of courses of
						study and examinations conducted by the Superintendent of Schools. Although desirable,
						there is so far no close connection between the schools and the <pb id="VAB8203-511"
							n="511"/> colleges or university. These institutions of higher learning are conducted
						by religious orders and governed by them in their own way, subject only to the general
						authority given to bishops in the government of their diocese.</p>

					<p>Each parish school is under the immediate superintendence of the pastor; it is his duty
						to visit the school at least once a week, watch over the morals of the children,
						stimulate their zeal, teach them in person the catechism and bible history, or at least
						see that this be done by competent teachers. It is also his duty to control the
						attendance of the children, the order and discipline of the school, the reverence and
						obedience of the pupils to their teachers and the love and loyalty of the children to
						the Church. It is also his exclusive privilege to determine whether a child may be
						dismissed or not.</p>

					<p>Above all it is on the pastor that the material support of the school depends, without
						good teachers we would have poor scholars, without diocesan supervision we might have
						imperfect standards, want of organization and arrested progress, but without good,
						zealous, self-sacrificing pastors we would have no schools at all. It is true that our
						good people contribute the funds, but the funds become available only through the work
						of the pastors. How true this is, history tells us. Parishes that had schools saw them
						disappear, while others so small that a school seemed impossible saw it grow and
						flourish and the ultimate cause of these changes was the pastor. Hence, if we have so
						many schools, not magnificent it is true but in excellent condition for the purpose for
						which they are intended; if we are able to make a yearly expenditure of what would be
						equivalent to over $400,000, if computed on the basis of $27.67, which it costs the
						public schools of Indiana to educate each pupil, full credit must be given to the
						pastor, whose indefatigable energy and undying zeal have made such things possible.</p>

					<p>Up to the present the support of the school is furnished in great part by tuition fees
						supplemented by contributions from church societies and from the funds of the parish.
						Pastors however are required to make every possible endeavor to have the school a free
						school and some have succeeded.</p>

					<p>A diocesan fund has been started to furnish the needed support for the poorer
						schools.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">Sites and Premises.</hi>-- The regulations of the School Board <pb
							id="VAB8203-512" n="512"/> regarding sites for school houses are not specified, nor is
						it possible to enter into much detail. The only requirements are, that the school be
						placed on grounds well drained, in a locality not detrimental to health, where a
						sufficient quantity of pure water can be obtained and the light be not obstructed. Other
						requirements are left to the judgment of the pastor.</p>

					<p>When a school is to be erected in a parish, the pastor is the judge of the plan, style,
						materials and cost of the building, and he also superintends the erection. After he has
						given his ideas to a competent architect and received plans and specifications, he is
						obliged to send them to the Bishop, who generally subjects them in turn to the
						Superintendent of Schools, but approves or rejects them according to his own judgment.
						Should he approve them, the Building Committee is notified and is obliged to visit the
						location of the proposed building and enter into a thorough discussion of all the
						practical details.</p>

					<p>The following recommendations are made by the School Board. All about the school should
						be kept in proper repair; the walls should be cleaned or white washed once a year; the
						floors swept and washed as often as cleanliness, neatness and the laws of health
						require; cloaks and hats should not hang in the school room; suitable means of
						ventilation should be provided, and heating apparatus should be sufficient to easily
						maintain a uniform temperature of 70 degrees throughout all the school rooms. Single
						desks should be preferred and should be adapted to the size of the pupils; they should
						be placed in the school room so that the light may fall over the left shoulder of the
						pupil; as much blackboard surface as possible should be provided, and of course a school
						is not considered properly equipped unless it has charts, globes, maps, dictionaries and
						other appliances which are necessary for the proper teaching of the different subjects
						embraced in the course.</p>

					<p>The water closets for the sexes should be under different roofs and all possible
						precautions should be taken to keep them clean and in a sanitary condition.</p>

					<p>Whatever be the source of drinking water, it should be protected with great care from
						any surface drainage or sewage of any kind.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">The Duties of the Children in Regard to Attendance.</hi>-- All children of
						required age are obliged to attend the parochial <pb id="VAB8203-513" n="513"/> school,
						unless they have been excused for reasons approved by the Bishop. This also applies to
						children advanced in their studies if the course for which they are fit is taught in the
						Catholic schools. Wherever there is a parochial school, no child will be admitted to
						first Communion, unless he has attended the parochial school for at least two years.</p>

					<p>Children living at a distance of four miles or more from the parochial school are
						exempted from the obligation of attending the parochial school.</p>

					<p>Children under ten years of age, living at a distance of from three to four miles from
						the parochial school are not obliged to attend the parochial school.</p>

					<p>Children under eight years of age, living at a distance of from two to three miles from
						the parochial school are not obliged to attend the parochial school.</p>

					<p>Parents who persistently refuse to send their children to the Catholic school cannot be
						absolved.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">Special Schools.</hi>-- While the progress of the primary schools in the
						diocese has been magnificent, the same cannot be said of the high schools for boys.</p>

					<p>As far back as in 1884 Bishop Dwenger urgently appealed to the priests, having charge
						of city parishes, to combine together and erect at least one high school for boys in
						each large city. So far, this appeal has remained unanswered mainly on account of an
						obstacle thus far insurmountable, lack of funds. Another serious difficulty is the
						scarcity of male teachers, combined with the refusal of the religious communities of
						women to teach boys over fifteen.</p>

					<p>We have no high school for boys if we use the term in its commonly accepted sense, for
						we have no school which offers the full four year high school course or the full
						counts.</p>

					<p>We are not, however, without schools teaching above the eighth grade even for boys.
						Several parishes have more advanced grades covering one or two or even three years, the
						course offered being mainly commercial. Typical among these is the school conducted by
						the Brothers of the Holy Cross in the Cathedral parish of Fort Wayne, the course
						occupies three years and offers English, Latin, Algebra, Bookkeeping, Stenography,
						Typewriting, Commercial Law and of course Religious Instruction.</p>

					<pb id="VAB8203-514" n="514"/>

					<p>It is well to note that the young men who desire to follow the classical or the
						scientific high school course, may do so within the diocese at the colleges of
						Rensselaer and Notre Dame, which conduct preparatory classes equivalent to those of the
						high school.</p>

					<p>In the matter of high schools for girls, the diocese is very fortunate. At least eight
						schools offer a four-year course comprising all the subjects taught in the best schools
						with the sole exception in some places of Chemistry, which is replaced by a sound course
						in Logic and Metaphysics.</p>

					<p>Much good could be accomplished if the plan to standardize all these high schools,
						which is now under serious consideration, could be successfully carried out. A course is
						now being prepared, which it is hoped will meet with hearty approval and gradually be
						adopted.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">Schools of Higher Learning.</hi>-- In this respect the diocese of Fort
						Wayne is especially blessed. At St. Mary's-of-the-Lake the Sisters of Holy Cross conduct
						a college for young women, which is thoroughly modern and equipped with the necessary
						botanical, physical and chemical laboratories. They offer the full collegiate course,
						not to mention unexcelled facilities for the study of art and painting, and vocal and
						instrumental music.</p>

					<p>At Collegeville there is an institution conducted by the Fathers of the Precious Blood,
						which offers to our young men at the most reasonable terms a four year classical or
						scientific course, a four year normal course, a three year commercial course, a course
						in civil engineering and German.</p>

					<p>Finally we have at Notre Dame, Indiana, besides a college, the crown of the educational
						system, a Catholic university under the direction of the Fathers of the Holy Cross. This
						great institution, with its fifty or more professors and instructors, is housed in
						magnificent buildings surrounded by spacious grounds and gives to the students, who come
						to it from all parts of the world, advanced courses in the following subjects:
						Philosophy, Greek, Latin, English, Elocution and Oratory, Ancient, Medieval and Modern
						History, Political and Social Science, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Provencal,
						Gaelic, German, Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Astronomy, Mechanical
						Engineering, Electrical Engineering, <pb id="VAB8203-515" n="515"/> Architecture,
						Artistic Drawing, Mechanical Drawing, Chemistry, Physics, Botany, Zoölogy, General
						Biology, Microscopy, Human Anatomy, Human Physiology, Bacteriology, Geology, Pharmacy,
						Music, Evidences of Christianity, Journalism, Law and Commerce and Telegraphy.</p>

					<p>It is incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana and grants the Degrees of
						Doctor of Laws, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Letters, Bachelor of Philosophy, Degree of
						Civil Engineer, of Mechanical Engineer, of Mechanical Engineer in Electrical
						Engineering, Degree of Pharmaceutical Chemist, of Bachelor of Laws and Degree of
						Graduate in Pharmacy.</p>

					<p>Briefly summing up therefore, the Diocese of Fort Wayne in its fifty years existence
						has walked far in respect to education, in the path of solid progress. It has passed
						from the log house school to the splendid modern edifice. It has passed from three
						schools with a handful of teachers and about a hundred and fifty pupils to one hundred
						institutions of learning with four hundred and seventy five teachers and professors and
						fifteen thousand seven hundred children. It has passed from the teacher that merely
						happened to a great body of pious, efficient and self-sacrificing men and women destined
						from their infancy to their high calling and leaving it only at the bidding of the Angel
						of Death. It has established an effective system of superintendence and supervision. It
						can take the child at the age of six years and watch over his education for a period of
						sixteen to twenty years. If at the end of the grammar school course he is prevented from
						going further, he finds himself reasonably equipped for his duties in life, as a good
						Catholic and good American citizen. If he pursues his studies through the high school,
						he enters life with a wide knowledge of English literature, science and mathematics and
						the requirements of a good business training. If a professional career is his choice, he
						will find at the Catholic University all the facilities for achieving success and even
						distinction in his chosen profession.</p>

					<p>Much of course remains to be done, but the history of the past augurs well for the
						future and the Diocese of Fort Wayne has every reason in this year of its Golden Jubilee
						to raise its voice in thanksgiving to God, the Author of all light and knowledge who has
						bestowed upon it His choicest blessings.</p>

						<hi rend="b">FORT WAYNE-ST. MARY'S CHURCH.</hi></head>

					<p>The handsome amount of $15,000 is being expended on the thorough renovation and
						interior decoration of St. Mary's Church in Fort Wayne. The frescoing is in light,
						delicate tints, blending from cream to buff on ceiling and on walls from cream to warm
						buff. The mouldings are treated in cream and gold. Along the moulds are seen arabesque
						ornaments running to the apex of ceiling, culminating in a fine Gothic center. The
						sanctuary is exceptionally rich in turquoise blue of ceiling and on the walls are two
						Gothic panels to match with windows; below which all around the tapestry is of rich
						design. In the sanctuary are the figures of two angels with trumpets: inscription over
						the angel on the gospel side, being "Tu solus sanctus," and below the angel, "Gloria in
						excelsis;" the inscription above the angel on the epistle side, "Tu solus Dominus," and
						below the angel, "Te Deum laudamus." The side altars having been thoroughly renovated
						have inscriptions over the Blessed Virgin's altar, "Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis;" and
						over St. Joseph's altar, "Sancte Joseph, ora pro nobis." Beneath these inscriptions we
						find exquisite damask tapestry with gold ornamentations.</p>

					<p>The base of the entire church to height of windows is treated in a solid rich pattern.
						The shafts of the columns are cream color, and the caps of columns are a very light
						shade terra-cotta, high lighted with gold. The general effect of the frescoing in light
						tones is to bring out the beautiful Gothic arches in bold relief.</p>

					<p>The panels of the transept ceiling contain eight figures of heroic size: Abraham,
						Moses, David and Elias of the Old Testament; and St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke and St.
						John, the four Evangelists of the New Testament. The walls of the transept have four
						large figures: the Archangels, St. Michael, battling with Satan and St. Raphael, the
						guide of Tobias; and <pb id="VAB8203-518" n="518"/> two angels bearing scrolls with the
						inscription, "Ehre sei Gott in der Hoehe," and "Friede den Menschen auf Erden." Back of
						the main altar are seen two angels and the inscription "Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus." We
						may add the entire ornamentation of the church is in true Gothic style and in chaste
						effects.</p>

					<p>The middle entrance has received three glass doors, the the center one large, the other
						two smaller. The aisles are covered with cork matting. The floor of the sanctuary is
						rich mosaic. The principal feature of the sanctuary is a new Carrara marble altar which,
						together with the Calvary group entailed an outlay of $7,000. The electric light is also
						one of the improvements, which with its very pretty Gothic fixtures will do much toward
						bringing out in full view the various ornamentations enumerated. The marble altar will
						be consecrated with becoming solemnities in October next.</p>
