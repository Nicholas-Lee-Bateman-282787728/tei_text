          <p>For three decades the presentation of classical plays has been a great factor in the effort to

                        presentation of Greek plays: their appeal is so universal that they bridge the chasm of the
                        centuries and arouse interest, not merely as spectacles of past grandeur, but as living works of
                        art, which move to sympathy and to tears as strongly as the work of the latest dramatist of the

        <p>All of these energies were felt on the campuses of Indiana's colleges. Greek and Latin
                    professors monitored the revivals of Greek drama with fascination, but none took the next step that
                    would lead to an actual production until 1908. Despite the fact that the institution had been slow
                    to make room for the arts, Wabash College was perhaps the first Indiana school to attempt production
                    of the classics. Although some dramatic readings by college literary societies had been popular
                    after the Civil War, little drama was seen at Wabash until after the turn of the century. In fact,
                    the first reference to the theater at Wabash dates back to 1836, four years after the founding of
                    the college, when the faculty passed a resolution banning "Thespian
                        amusements."<hi
            rend="sup">7</hi> Resistance to theatrical activity slowly eroded
                    during the last decades of the century, paving the way for the productions that were the dream of
                    young Professor Hains. He had noticed that student energies were divided at this time as new
                    disciplines were introduced into the curriculum and a variety of extracurricular activities
                    burgeoned. Hains became concerned about waning interest in the study of Greek and the classics in
                    general, and he began to work aggressively to generate new interest in the study of the classics. He
                    determined that an effective way of inspiring interest on the campus, and in the greater Indiana
                    community, was to attempt to produce the finest of the Greek tragedies in a manner that closely
                    approximated the staging traditions employed by the ancient Greeks themselves. Hains was also
                    influenced by Anglin's productions, which he felt were "magnificently staged and
                    splendidly acted,"<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and the productions at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
          </placeName> and the University of <placeName>
            <region reg="cau" type="state">California</region>
          </placeName>. In fact, surviving photographic evidence suggests that the reusable setting
                    constructed at Wabash for the plays was modeled on the University of <placeName>
            <region reg="cau" type="state">California</region>
          </placeName>'s Greek Theatre as much as on the surviving archaeological evidence of the
                    actual ancient theaters. This setting appears to have been used for most of the productions Hains
                    mounted, with slight modifications made depending on the needs of a particular play.</p>

                            January 16, 1837, for violating the rule. It seems Powers was committed to perform in a
                            theatrical exhibition of the local "Thespian Society" in December, 1836,
                            before the rule was passed. Later, the faculty decided that the penalty was perhaps too
                            severe in light of the offender's previous obligation to perform and his ignorance
                            of the rule, so they were content to settle for a reading before the college of an admission
                            of violation of college law.</item>

        <p>By any standards the "Greek Plays" featured elaborate settings, costumes, and
                    programs and were ably performed by the students of Wabash and some <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>

          </placeName> citizens. Although Hains had initially considered presenting the plays in the original
                    Greek, he finally opted for English translation: "I do not believe," he wrote,
                    "that the results would compensate for the additional labor involved, and I am sure that
                    the spectators would not be moved so deeply by the power of the tragedy, were they compelled to
                    follow the action by means of a libretto."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> In reflecting on the
                    productions, Hains stressed the difficulty of producing classical plays with amateurs. He faced the
                    added problem of an all-male student body at <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash</region>

          </placeName>, which meant that men would play women's roles as had been done in the ancient
                    productions although it was an unfamiliar convention to modern audiences. He felt this was
                    appropriate, however, and in the casting of the women's roles he noted, "in this
                    case it is not merely a question of dramatic ability but also of face and
                    figure—complexion makes no difference: the ‘make-up’ box will
                    remedy deficiencies along that line—but it is essential that the actor who plays a
                    feminine part shall have delicate features."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> At Wabash competition
                    for the roles intensified each year, and Hains noticed that students were taking classics courses,
                    in part as a way of preparing themselves for the productions.</p>

        <p>Hain's instinctive commonsense approach to preparing the plays would ultimately serve as a
                    model for many Indiana schools and groups who would borrow his costumes, props, and, most
                    importantly, his ideas. Rehearsals for each play began as much as four months before the actual
                    performances with some aspect of the play dealt with everyday during that period. Hains worked with
                    the leading actors first since they were burdened with the <list type="footnotes">

                    chorus members, many recruited from the Glee Club, who faced the most difficult task of performing
                    in unison the complicated choral odes and having to project their voices over long distances
                    outdoors (weather permitting, Hains held rehearsals outdoors as often as possible). Music composed
                    for the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>

          </placeName> and University of California productions accompanied the choral passages with piano,
                    flute, clarinet, violin, cornet, and harp being used at various times as Hains experimented with the
                    most effective combination. He found that in these days before microphones the cornet was
                    "particularly valuable in carrying the air in the open; the piano can be heard but a short
                    distance if there is any breeze stirring, and there is need of a strong lead to keep the singers
                        together."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Although Hains had virtually no professional training as a theatrical director, he wisely endeavored
                    to keep the staging simple and austere, carefully plotting entrances, exits, and
                    "picturesque" stage compositions. He emphasized a close study of the text but felt
                    that "almost as much can be done by the hands, face, and body as by vocal
                        expression."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> To this end he worked with the actors on their
                    movements, beginning with the "use of the hands, not in set gestures, but to aid in the
                    interpretation of the part. ‘To talk with the hands’ is quite an art and it
                    can be mastered only after long practice, but it is very essential.’ The goal for Hains
                    was "to secure as accurate an interpretation as possible of each phrase, line, and
                    scene." Elaborately choreographed dances were often employed for the choral scenes in
                    classical productions of the era, but Hains made "no attempt to introduce dancing; there
                    are no girls at <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash</region>

          </placeName>; we do not have a dancing master for the boys; and, besides, the choral music has taken
                    so well that it has not seemed necessary."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Hains was assisted in the mounting of these productions by his wife, Lulu Britton Hains
                    (1873–1945), who, with minimal assistance from faculty wives and local women and modest
                    financial support, designed and constructed the appropriate period costumes. For the costumes Hains
                    advocated the use of "unbleached muslin, which costs about as much as the cheesecloth used
                    in many places and drapes far better."<hi
            rend="sup">15</hi> Under the guidance of a
                    professional scenic artist, students constructed and painted the scenic elements, which were made of
                    "regular ‘flats’" fastened to a two-by-four framework. It
                    all cost "seventy or eighty dollars, including material, labor, and the bill of a

                    the tragedies and applauded other colleges and universities similarly attempting to revive the
                    classics. He also raised several significant issues about the problems of staging ancient drama in
                    the modern era. In a lecture he presented at the Sixth Annual Meeting of the Classical Association
                    of the Middle West and South in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

          </placeName> on April 30, 1910, Hains wrote that his desire to produce the classic dramas stemmed
                    from a "belief in the dramatic power" of the works and to "show a modern
                    audience the masterpieces of a civilization which, though it passed from the stage long ago, has
                    still a mighty influence on the life of the present."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

          </placeName>, listing them in a small notebook that covered professional, college, and even high
                    school productions. Sophocles' <hi
            rend="i">Antigone</hi> was, by far, the most produced,
                    with nearly two dozen productions listed between 1910 and 1915. In Indiana, Hains noted productions
                    at Notre Dame University and Earlham College along with several high schools and little theater
                    groups. Some groups, perhaps feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the ancient dramas, produced
                    smaller-scale Grecian pageants based on classical myths; these included titles such as <hi rend="i">Galatea</hi> (presented at <placeName>

                    these Indiana productions profited directly from Hains's experience; properties and
                    costumes were borrowed repeatedly by many groups. The Wabash College Archives' files on
                    Hains's work include a considerable collection of correspondence requesting advice as well

                    exceeded his own expectations in contributing to a heightened interest in the classics.</p>

        <p>Hains resigned from the faculty of Wabash College in 1916 for a career in business (although he
                    served as a member of the Wabash Board of Trustees from 1919 to 1924), but not before directing two
                    more productions unrelated to the series of "Greek Plays." These were John
                    Galsworthy's <hi
            rend="i">Pigeon</hi> and Shakespeare's <hi
            rend="i">Taming of the
                        Shrew</hi> for the Wabash College Dramatic Society, started by Professor Lucian Cary
                    (1886–1971) of the Department of English. The society was dedicated to complementing
                    Hains's work by producing significant contemporary dramas (their first production was
                    George Bernard Shaw's comedy <hi
            rend="i">Arms and the Man</hi>, performed in the spring of
                        1909).<hi
            rend="sup">34</hi> No classical play was produced at Wabash in 1916 (or for many years
                    thereafter); instead, an elaborate all-college pageant was presented in celebration of the
                    anniversary of Indiana statehood. In eight short years, however, Hains had far exceeded his
                    professed goals. As early as 1910 he had written that performances of the Greek plays "have
                    been given at forty-seven institutions and to the number of a hundred and one. … The
                    increasing number of such performances augurs happily for the future of the classics in our schools
                    and colleges."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Hains himself had contributed mightily to the bright future for the classics that he envisioned;
                    certainly in Indiana he was responsible for an intensified interest in classical studies. Closer to
                    home, he had established a permanent niche for drama, classical and contemporary, at Wabash College
                    and undoubtedly throughout the state. In responding to a letter praising the emotional power of a
                    chautauqua performance of one of the "Greek Plays," Hains asked, "Can we
                    not hope that this will be repeated many times in the future upon many audiences and that by this
                    means many who now think of Greek as a ‘dead language' may find their ideas
                    decidedly in need of revision?"<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

                            with the local news of our county, humor, drollery and keen sarcasm. Its sole editor and
                            proprietor was William D. M. Wickham, an original genius of the first water. The press
                            itself was decidedly pioneer, the bed of it was the top of a sycamore stump, and the lever a
                            long pole inserted into a mortise in a tree standing by its side; on this he printed his <hi

                            timbers. This he called "Wickham's Velocity Press," and did what

          </placeName> history (1921), A. L. Gary and E. B. Thomas wrote: "Wickham was certainly not

                    outfit up here [to Rushvillel could have hauled a small press at the same time, hence the suspicion
                    that the sycamore stump story is mythical. Certainly the type faces were not whittled out of
                    shoe-pegs, and it is equally likely his press was not cut out of a sycamore log."<hi

                    probably lasting halt to printing, warping the press's wood frame and rusting the metal
                    parts as well as ruining the paper stock and playing havoc with the type cases. More logically, as

                    imagination to believe he had access to metal working tools that could turn out such machined parts

        <p>If Wickham's unhappy apprenticeship ran its usual course, it would have ended after five to
                    seven years, or at the earliest, which seems likely, around 1823. Under whom Wickham trained besides
                    Burchfield cannot be determined, nor is it even certain that he was in <placeName>

            <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
          </placeName> printing office at some point before December, 1818, thus yielding the day-to-day
                    operation of the newspaper to Burchfield, who in turn may have left the establishment in early 1819,
                    leaving John DuFour the sole principal. A printer named John Douglass (1787–1851), who

                            Rushvillians remembered Wickham as "a tall, angular man." Moses,

                            whose frame often became permanently stooped from years of pulling the impression bar of his
                            press, a strenuous task. In a small town such a person would stick out like a signpost. But
                            was Wickham "tall"? Apparently he was not if Burchfield's
                            description of him was accurate, which it undoubtedly was. A youth in his middle teens in
                            1818, Wickham probably did not grown much taller.</item>

                    boroughs, and the number of their inhabitants, the names of rivers and creeks with their sources and

          </placeName>. At the time Scott may have been thinking about bringing out his Indiana gazetteer as
                    well. Likely strapped for money to meet his debts to the newspapers that carried his prospectus,
                    Wickham in February, 1825, offered "a first rate shot gun" for sale, which could
                    be seen at the office of the <hi

                    still unsold by early April.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Either within a few weeks or within several
                    months Wickham quit Keen's printing office. In the autumn of 1825 Edmund Buxton, editor of

            <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
          </placeName>
          <hi rend="i">Public Leger</hi>, queried Keen about the gazetteer: "A few weeks since we

            <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>

          </placeName> Register when the Indiana Gazzetteer would be published, to which he returned the
                    following: ‘William D. M. Wickham, who proposed publishing the ‘Indiana
                    Gazzetteer,’ has left this place.—I know not when it will make its appearance,
                    consequently I am unable to give my friend, the editor of the Leger, the information

            <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>

          </placeName> or if he made a sudden departure for the rapidly developing New Purchase area. In
                    either case his gazetteer was never published, perhaps because of lack of sufficient subscribers. It
                    is also possible, however, that Wickham had a falling out with Keen, known for driving a hard
                        bargain,<hi

                    to use the <hi rend="i">Register's</hi> equipment. More intriguing, though, is that John
                    Scott could have been the motivating factor in Wickham's relocation. Fearing that
                    Wickham's gazetteer would appear before his, Scott might have lured Wickham to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
          </placeName> with an offer that the young printer found irresistible—or so it is
                    interesting to conjecture.</p>

        <p>Soon after his arrival in Indiana in 1816, Scott apparently began gathering information about
                    settlements and resources with the intention of publishing a guide for ernigrants.<hi
            rend="sup">36</hi> When, in late 1824, Wickham's prospectus arrived at Scott's printing

                    received a small, paper-covered, 142-page book containing geographic and demographic data,
                    information that Wickham intended for his abandoned project. Unfortunately, Scott did not include an

        <p>Hiram H. Martin thought of himself as just an ordinary fellow. Looking back on his life as he began
                    penning the reminiscences he was to leave behind for his daughters, he concluded that he had not
                    done anything that called "for any especial commendation."<hi rend="sup">l</hi>
                    Yet the story of his life—particularly that part of it spent in the service of his
                    country—is well worth considering, if for no other reason than because it is a story that
                    has been repeated many times over by the young men and women who have left their civilian pursuits
                    in times of national emergency and answered the call to arms.</p>

            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName>, Martin remembered his early years as "the happy days of inocent childhood
                    when it took but little to satisfy the mind … ." In 1851, however, his father
                    died unexpectedly, and the innocent days of childhood came to an end. In later years Martin
                    attributed his failure to accomplish some great thing to "my father dying when I was so
                    young, [a circumstance which] prevented in part, my not having an opportunity to obtain But a meager

                        of his life. A man with a keen sense of history, he had been frustrated in his attempts to learn
                        about his parents and grandparents by the paucity of information that was available to him, and
                        he was determined that his descendants—if they were so inclined—would not

                    for 75,000 volunteers went out at the fall of Fort Sumter, Martin had to bide his time. At the end

                        were transcribed from photocopies of the original handwritten memoir. Martin himself apparently
                        edited his account at some point, scratching out certain words and phrases and adding others.
                        Every attempt has been made to select Martin's preferred version of his reminiscence.
                        Material written above the line or in margins has been inserted in what appears to be the proper
                        place in the text. Abbreviations have been brought down to the line, and those written as
                        2", 4", l", for example, have been transcribed as 2nd, 4th, 1st, etc.
                        Martin sometimes used dashes, and occasionally what appear to be commas, to end sentences. All
                        such closing marks have been transcribed as periods. Where there is no end punctuation at all,
                        double spaces have been used to designate sentence breaks. In two instances Martin inserted
                        unnecessary question marks in the text, perhaps to remind himself to check factual information
                        that he had included. Those marks have been deleted. Although every attempt was made to
                        determine Martin's intent regarding paragraphing and

        <p>"We got through without a skirmish. The nights had begun to get quite cool and there was a

                    have forgotten to mention was our drilling. It was drill drill nearly all the time. It was laughable
                    to see how awkwerd some of the new recruits were. It seemed almost impossible for some of them to
                    learn to drill or become used to the manuel of arms. While I knew nothing about it before, it did
                    not come very hard for me, and I would not take a back seat for any one in our company, in drilling

                    the diffirence between the farms and buildings of the north and those of the south. The out
                    buildings, fences, and general appearance of their plantations were slovenly, and looked uncared
                    for. Labor that was controled by the lash was not like the free labor of the north, it had its
                    blighting effect upon every thing it touched. Although of course there were many pretty places
                    there.</p>

                    wagons with our tents the long roll beat to arms, and as the boys grabed their guns and fell in,
                    they began to realize that we were near the scene of conflict, and a trembling was noticeable in
                    some. But it must be remembered that many of them were like my self only boys of 18 years of age,
                    and many of them knew nothing of the use of arms. The cause of the alarm was an attack on the picket

                    five non Commissioned Officers at our Post, and none of us were on guard, but had our belts off, and
                    guns laying some distance from us. They gave us a lecture on the duties of soldiers, while on
                    picket, but blamed our officers more than they did us. Sweet potatoes suffered at that picket post
                    as there was a patch of them very near us.</p>
        <p>"Every one dreaded picket on the other side of the river, for when we left camp in the

                    beginning to get cold, and rainy. It was a mixture of wind snow &amp; frost, and the soft side
                    of a rail was our only bed, if we wanted to sleep, and keep out of the mud.</p>

                    good many calls upon the Dr. I was troubled with Diarrhoea considerably, and had an attack of
                    Intermittent fever. But the climax came about Jan. 1st [1862] when one day I was on duty as Corporal
                    of the Guard. The duty of the Corporal was to place the guard on picket around the camp, and see
                    that they attended to their duties and if any thing should happen, or one of the guards wanted to be
                    relieved, or any one wanted to get in or out, the guard wold sing out, <hi

                            lieutenant colonel, Alfred D. Ellet. Ellet's "marines" were
                            organized in the fall of 1862 after the navy, citing lack of manpower, turned down Admiral
                            David Porter's request for an authentic marine brigade to work with the Mississippi
                            Squadron in keeping the rivers clear of guerrillas. The Mississippi River Marine Brigade
                            resembled a modern "task force" and included elements of infantry,
                            artillery, and cavalry—all transported aboard a small fleet of packet boats. The
                            brigade performed excellent service until 1864 when it was disbanded—some say
                            because of Ellet's refusal to transfer the ships and men under his command to the
                            navy and to recognize the authority of the admiral in command of the Mississippi Squadron.

                        Red River, which did not come until the second week in March. In a dispatch to the secretary of
                        the navy dated March 2, 1864, Porter wrote: "I came down here [to the mouth of the Red
                        River] anticipating a move on the part of the army up toward Shreveport, but as the river is

                        to this Red River expedition. With all the existing evidence there can be little doubt that some
                        prominent party or parties on the opposing sides were in cahoots with each other, the object
                        being to sell Southern cotton through Northern civilian dealers. By such a procedure the
                        Northern armed forces would be collecting Southern cotton for transport and sale, its owners
                        would be reimbursed in due course, and the furtherance of the rebellion would thus be assisted.
                        Ordinarily the Federal forces were not in a position to seize much cotton and carry it off for
                        condemnation. When they did take any privately owned cotton or other valuable property the usual
                        procedure was to give receipts for it payable after the close of hostilities. Confederate
                        government property was of course seized outright or destroyed. Most of the suspicious-looking
                        events [such as just happening to have ‘two or three empty coal barges’
                        along when a cache of cotton was discovered?] which came to pass in connection with the Red
                        River affair certainly appear to be part of the cotton-collecting plan. Something, at any rate,
                        brought about several moves which seem very peculiar from a military standpoint. Be it said to
                        the credit of practically every rank and file on both sides, however, there was no pulling of

                        toward the same objective. By April 10, Porter had pushed up the river to within thirty miles of
                        Shreveport only to find that Banks had not made it, having been stopped by Confederate forces at
                        the Battle of Sabine Cross Roads two days before. There was nothing for Porter to do but to
                        fight his way back down the river. Battling both Confederates and low water, he finally was able

          <hi rend="i">Wendell Willkie: Hoosier Internationalist</hi> is a remarkable and useful compilation of
                    essays from several standpoints. Prepared to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of
                    Willkie's birth, the book contains a series of thoughtful and well-written essays from
                    scholars in the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>, <country reg="fr">France</country>
          </placeName>, and the Russian Federation, the purpose of which is to explore
                    Willkie's legacy to the world. The volume is an excellent introduction to
                    Willkie's career for those who do not know him, a solid summary of the historical
                    scholarship on Willkie, and an important contribution to the literature for those who are familiar
                    with him. Furthermore, the essays are valuable not only as an exploration of Willkie's
                    career but also for the insight they provide into the ways historians and biographers explain the
                    lives and actions of politicians.</p>
        <p>Born in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Elwood</settlement>
          </placeName>, Indiana, in 1892, Willkie was both a contradiction and confirmation of some of the
                    stereotypes of a Hoosier politician. The subtitle of the book suggests that there was something
                    unique about being a "Hoosier Internationalist"; indeed, as James H. Madison
                    points out in his splendid introduction, "To label Willkie a Hoosier internationalist might
                    seem like an oxymoron." He was an internationalist from a land of isolationists. Early in
                    life he flirted with socialism, became a Wilsonian Democrat imbued with the ideals of the League of
                    Nations, continued to play an active role in Democratic politics until his sudden switch to the
                    Republican party in 1939, and, without ever holding public office, captured the Republican
                    nomination for president of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> in 1940.</p>
        <p>According to the authors of these essays, two concepts came to dominate Willkie's political
                    philosophy during the course of his political odyssey: civil liberties and international
                    collaboration. He became a champion of the civil rights of African Americans long before either
                    party embraced the idea. He saw the struggle for civil rights in the <placeName>

                    world. He, perhaps more than any other man except F#2 D. Roosevelt, contributed to the end of
                    American isolationism and envisioned an "American era" in which the <placeName>

          </placeName> would be the dominant force in shaping world peace through a global economy and
                    political cooperation.</p>
        <p>As is the case with all aspirants to the presidency, Willkie's public and private persona
                    were often at odds, especially if one accepts the mythology in which Americans enshroud presidential
                    candidates. Several of the essays effectively explore the man and the myth, particularly those of
                    George T. Blakey and Mark H. Leff. Was he a good Hoosier? Does he qualify for the distinction even
                    though he spent ten years in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Akron</settlement>, <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>, and his most productive years in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
          </placeName>? Was he the rumpled country hayseed the press (and his campaign) portrayed him to be,
                    or was his only brush with country living the view of Central Park from his apartment window? Harold
                    Ickes called him "the simple barefoot Wall Street lawyer," and therein lies a tale
                    well explored in this volume.</p>
        <p>Essayists also assess Willkie's famous book <hi
            rend="i">One World</hi>, written after a
                    whirlwind world tour in 1942. <hi rend="i">One World</hi> became a runaway best seller in 1943, and
                    it contains the best single statement of Willkie's internationalist views and his
                    dedication to equal rights for all people. Yet, as French scholar Andre Kaspi points out, the work
                    was both farsighted and shortsighted. Kaspi is critical of Willkie for his failure to address the
                    extermination of Jews, his limited understanding of French circumstances, and his failure to put
                    forward a comprehensive plan for postwar Europe.</p>
        <p>Finally, the volume is useful and quite refreshing in the way it explores Willkie's
                    definition and practice of liberalism. <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>

          </placeName> Sitkoff discusses Willkie's contributions to the civil rights movement and his
                    collaboration with Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
                    (NAACP). But the volume concludes with a wonderful speech that Willkie delivered at Indiana
                    University in 1938. In the address Willkie defines liberalism not as the exclusive property of
                    either political party but as an <hi rend="i">"attitude of mind"</hi> (p. 160).
                    Willkie saw liberalism as a centrist position between the extremes of the Right and the Left. The
                    emphasis of the liberal, he said, is on "individual freedom, while in the ideologies of
                    either the Right or the Left it is upon social control" (p. 160). He also described the
                    major transformation in the application of liberalism in the early decades of the twentieth century
                    from a struggle against Big Business to one against Big Government. There is much to be learned from
                    Willkie's life, and much to be gleaned from this volume.</p>

            <region type="county">Marion County</region>
          </placeName> Public Library (I-MCPL) in anticipation of the library's centennial in 1973.
                    Unfortunately, the project lay dormant for a number of years, and it was not until 1989 that
                    Lawrence J. Downey began to verify, edit, and expand the earlier work. Downey, who started his
                    library career as a high school page, joined the I-MCPL staff in 1951 and served in a variety of
                    capacities until 1988 when he retired as associate director for Management Services.</p>
        <p>In twenty-five chapters Downey describes and commemorates the institution that Eliza Gordon Browning
                    (sixth librarian, 1892–1917) wanted to become "a live thing in the whole
                    town" (p. 27). Beginning with brief mention of Indiana's earliest libraries, the
                    author provides a context for the establishment of the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName> Public Library in 1873. The first ten chapters, with the exception of Chapter
                    5—which is devoted to the construction of the Central Library—are organized by
                    librarian, beginning with Charles Evans and concluding with Raymond Gnat. The remaining chapters
                    address such topics as the formation of the city-county library system in 1968, divisions and
                    departments, branch libraries and service to neighborhoods, staff education and training, the staff
                    association and publications, noteworthy gifts, and the I-MCPL foundation.</p>
        <p>Although librarians are committed to the preservation and dissemination of the human record, the
                    profession as a whole has a tendency to ahistoricity. Librarians, as well as readers interested in
                    state, local, and cultural history, will benefit from perusing this volume. Highly readable, the
                    text is lavishly illustrated with photographs of individuals, buildings, activities, and numerous
                    historical documents. The chapters on service to neighborhoods, branch libraries, and extension
                    agencies provide glimpses of the city's educational system, immigrant communities, and
                    women's club movement. Finally, this volume also includes lists of library trustees, I-MCPL
                    Foundation members, assistant librarians, associate directors, and branch and bookmobile managers.</p>

        <p>Readers who wish to explore some of the many topics discussed in this work will be frustrated by the
                    complete absence of footnotes. Although the author ‘evidently examined a wide range of
                    archival materials, the bibliography (pp. 241–42) is sparse and fails to include even
                    such a basic and relevant title as Edward Holley's biography of Charles Evans. Nonetheless,

                    Dreiser's experiences as a young journalist is a masterful example of textual scholarship
                    and an absorbing autobiographical account of the coming of age of one of America's, and
                    Indiana's, most important authors. Though Dreiser had become accustomed to the kind of
                    "sanitizing" that editors and publishers inflicted on his manuscripts to make them
                    palatable to the conservative reading public of the early 1900s he was never happy about the
                    process. He often expressed his hope to friends such as H. L. Mencken and others that restored
                    versions of his memoirs and novels would be published after his death. "The fact that he
                    preserved the holograph and both typescripts of <hi

                    to the University of Pennsylvania strongly suggests that he hoped this book would someday be
                    published in an uncut edition," writes editor T. D. Nostwich (p. 745). The Pennsylvania
                    edition of <hi rend="i">Newspaper Days</hi> would surely have received the author's
                    approval.</p>

                    Nostwich brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the task of establishing a critical text for
                    this volume. Adhering to traditional standards of textual editing that seek to reveal authorial
                    intention by relying on the text that is closest to the author's own hand, Nostwich uses
                    Dreiser's holograph manuscript as the base text for this edition and allows alterations
                    into that text through a complicated priority system that gives highest priority to
                    Dreiser's handwritten revisions. The result is an eclectic text that represents a synthesis
                    of all relevant texts rather than an exact reproduction of any existing text. "It is
                    … a new work of art," explains the editor, "never before published, and
                    it must be approached freshly and interpreted anew" (p. 751).</p>

          <hi rend="i">The Protestant Experience in Gary, Indiana, 1906–1975: At Home in the
                    City</hi>. By James W. Lewis. (<placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
          </placeName>: University of Tennessee Press, 1992. Pp. xv, 285. Illustrations, tables, notes,
                    bibliography, index. $39.95.)</head>
        <p>James W. Lewis's study is at the cutting edge of a new interest in congregational studies.
                    Lewis demonstrates that congregational histories can serve as "building blocks"
                    for a richer national religious history (p. 8). Well versed in urban history, sociology, and
                    religious history, he also shows that religion played a more central urban role than historians have
                    generally acknowledged.</p>
        <p>Lewis's central theme is that Protestants were neither uncomfortable nor unsuccessful in
                    industrial cities. Lewis may exaggerate previous authors’ emphasis on Protestant
                    anti-urbanism, but he makes a telling point: "Gary's Protestants knew at first
                    hand that the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> was becoming an urban society and were among its creators—proudly and
                    self-consciously urban" (p. 10). They were "energized," not
                    "immobilized," by the city's plethora of problems (p. 205). Though a
                    religious minority, they assumed broad responsibility for the city's welfare.</p>
        <p>Lewis first establishes the context for his examination of two of Gary's principal churches.
                    He traces the city's creation, political history, and ethnic, racial, and religious
                    diversity and documents the Protestant contribution to the settlement movement, political and moral
                    reform, an innovative public program of religious education, and ecumenical and interracial
                    cooperation.</p>

        <p>The two congregations to which Lewis subsequently turns represent different theological and social
                    orientations within mainstream Protestantism. Both were influenced by evangelicalism <hi
            rend="i">and</hi> the Social Gospel. His examination of each congregation's formation, building
                    programs, and pastoral leadership reveals, however, that First Presbyterian stressed its ministry to
                    its own members <pb

          <pb id="VAA4025-089-1-071" n="65"/> more than public-sector activities, while City Methodist
                    emphasized more strongly its public mission.</p>
        <p>Despite their differences both churches took a public role for granted and were "at home in
                    the city," at least until the 1950s, when they began to flounder. Like downtown churches
                    elsewhere, they benefitted from Gary's vitality in the 1920s and again after World War II,
                    but profound economic shifts, suburbanization, and rapid increases in the black population
                    constituted insurmountable problems. First Presbyterian survived only by merger in 1975; City
                    Methodist closed its doors that same year. Not anti-urbanism, but overwhelming environmental
                    changes, made them "no longer at home in the city" (p. 133).</p>
        <p>Lewis's choice of elite churches leaves the reader wondering how blue-collar Protestants and
                    Protestants in the Fundamentalist, Pentecostal, and Holiness traditions fared. One might also expect
                    greater attention to the laity. Nevertheless, Lewis provides a valuable comparative perspective,
                    based on a use of local religious records that other congregational studies might emulate.</p>

        <p>Located in the American Bottom, just across the Mississippi River from modern <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
          </placeName>, Cahokia was a Mississippian ceremonial and commercial center that flourished between
                    600 and 1300 A.D. and whose population during the late eleventh century may have reached twenty
                    thousand. The site was first excavated during the 1920s, and during the past half-century
                    archaeologists have continued their investigations and have attempted to ascertain the cause of the
                    city's emergence and decline, its influence upon surrounding regions, and its relationship
                    to other Mississippian communities. The volume contains seventeen essays focusing upon these
                    subjects and represents the current state of scholarship in this field.</p>

        <p>Although not all of the essayists agree, there seems to be a general consensus that Cahokia was
                    developed by a population indigenous to the ecologically rich American Bottom but that initially it
                    was heavily influenced by other Mississippian centers to the south. The introduction of maize into
                    the region in approximately <pb
            id="VAA4025-089-1-072" n="66"/> 750 A.D. facilitated the growth of a
                    larger, more permanent population, which in turn resulted in a more stratified society, a richer
                    ceremonial complex, and an expanded trade network. After 1300 climatic changes and the introduction
                    of northern flint corn into the region encouraged a population dispersal that caused the site
                    eventually to be abandoned. Most of the essayists agree that Cahokia's influence was
                    focused primarily to the north, and although there is little evidence to suggest that Cahokia sent
                    out colonists who eventually settled in northern Illinois or the upper Mississippi valley (with the
                    exception of the Spoon River, Apple River, and Red Wing sites), Mississippian communities developed
                    in these regions through indigenous people's contacts with Cahokia and the American Bottom.
                    Once established, however, these northern communities probably maintained closer ties among
                    themselves than with Cahokia.</p>
        <p>This is an important book and will be welcomed by both professional historians and general readers
                    who are interested in the pre-Columbian history of the upper Mississippi valley. Unlike numerous
                    archaeological site reports that delineate, in great detail, the artifacts discovered at a
                    particular site, the essays in this volume generally synthesize archaeological data and attempt to
                    place such information within a historical context. Obviously, some of the essayists disagree about
                    various facets of Cahokia's influence and decline, but their cogent and careful arguments
                    should be of considerable interest to nonspecialists. Moreover, their focus upon Cahokia and its
                    influence will be very useful to those professional historians who wish to further their knowledge

        <p>This is a book about Native American religious power—how it was acquired and how it was
                    used. A little studied and not well understood phenomenon, Native American religious power, Dowd
                    argues, underlay the important resistance struggle waged by Eastern Woodlands Indians from at least
                    the early eighteenth century until the period of the War of 1812. This resistance movement, called
                    "nativistic" by Dowd, was a systematic, organized, and theoretically informed
                    commitment by Native American religious leaders to unite all Indians from the Great Lakes to the
                    Gulf of <pb

          <placeName>

          </placeName> in a concerted, often militant, effort to preserve Indian cultures, lands, and
                    political and economic independence.</p>
        <p>The prophets Dowd writes about are well known to scholars. Neolin, Tenskwatawa, Tecumseh, Handsome
                    Lake, Josiah Francis, and others, the author claims, drew from a common prophetic heritage that
                    linked them across time and space to the mythic past and informed their efforts to acquire spiritual
                    power. Properly invigorated with ritual and ceremony, such power could be harnessed to shape the
                    future for the benefit of all Indian people. But the prophets and their nativist followers met stiff
                    resistance within as well as outside Indian country. Native people differed in their interpretations
                    of events. Some believed their future was best served in association with Europeans, not in
                    opposition to them. These "accommodationists" rejected the nativism of the
                    prophets and sought power elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Dowd finds this history divided into three periods. During the mid-eighteenth century nativists and
                    accommodationists opposed each other. In the Revolutionary period they united in alliance with the
                    British against the Americans, but by the 1790s they were again at cross purposes. This pattern of
                    factionalism, Dowd argues, is a significant factor in the ultimate failure of the nativists to
                    achieve their goals.</p>

        <p>Dowd's contribution lies in his approach. Anthony F. C. Wallace, R. David Edmunds, and other
                    recent scholars have fleshed out the histories of the prophets Dowd discusses. But Dowd puts them,
                    and their movements, into a broad context that emphasizes cultural similarity across tribal lines,
                    that links their prophetic visions and teachings to both the ancient past and to each other, that
                    stresses Pan-Indianism, and that above all gives life and meaning to their search for spiritual
                    power. In this Dowd finds a place next to Joel Martin's <hi rend="i">Sacred Revolt</hi>, a
                    recently published study of the early nineteenth-century Creek prophetic movement.</p>
        <p>Dowd understands the earlier period better than the later and the North better than the South, and
                    while his notes attest to the breadth of his research, they also reveal the gaps in the evidence.
                    This is nevertheless a fascinating, important, and impressive book. Dowd has revitalized the
                    discussion of this very significant period of Native American history.</p>

        <p>This evocative work continues John Seelye's meditations on rivers and their place in the
                    American culture. Geopolitical imagination is the objective of Seelye's
                    research—such grand images of <pb
            id="VAA4025-089-1-074" n="68"/> collective purpose
                    spread out on continental maps as were the stock-in-trade of early American geographers, patriotic
                    poets, explorers, speculators, boosters, and political founders.</p>
        <p>Borrowing contemporaries' appreciation for rivers as natural spatial organizers, Seelye
                    explores writings about rivers, seeking clues to the evolution of American national purpose (he
                    calls it the "republican plan"). What he finds is an unanticipated reversal in the
                    promise of America's waterways. At the dawn of national existence George <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

          </placeName> had seen a providential opportunity for integration, coherence, and unity through
                    inland navigation; the next generation experienced instead centrifugal pressures that fostered
                    ambition, competition, and disintegration. Both visions yielded empire, to be sure; but where the
                    first promised order and enlightenment, the second favored chaos, individualism, and aggression.
                    Seelye unpacks this contrast slowly, carefully explicating for the reader the contents of such
                    important texts as John Filson's <hi
            rend="i">Discovery and Settlement of Kentucke</hi>
                    (1784), Jedidiah Morse's <hi
            rend="i">American Geography</hi> (1789), Joel
                    Barlow's <hi rend="i">Columbiad</hi> (1807), the expedition journals of Zebulon <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
          </placeName> (1808) and Meriwether Lewis (1814), Elkanah Watson's <hi rend="i">History of
                        the … Western Canals</hi> (1820) and many others.</p>
        <p>Seelye's literary methods required him to treat with care the rhetoric of visionary writers,
                    and his path of inquiry often raises questions that his sources do not readily address.
                    Seelye's nuanced reading of texts beautifully traces a distinction (too little acknowledged
                    by historians) between the designs of the founders and the mere desires of their liberated children,
                    between an almost mathematical rhetoric of enlightenment projection and its selfish echo in a
                    generation of political and economic hucksters. Unfortunately, Seelye's literary sources
                    cannot explain the causes of this cultural sea change. Thus the brilliant contrast between a heroic
                    George <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> and a scurrilous James Wilkinson (pp. 213–24) seems rooted in the
                    latter's bad character (a historical accident). The same limitation encourages Seelye to
                    jump prematurely from the celebration of the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
          </placeName> Canal to an almost inevitable sectional crisis because of cultural change. Such a
                    conclusion may be very true, but the rich history that sustains such truth is not provided in this
                    volume.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="i">Beautiful Machine</hi> is an important book, and Seelye's title suggests the
                    reason why: the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> was conceived as a beautiful machine, and there was from the beginning a close
                    connection in the minds of the founders between rivers and the republican plan. If Seelye does not
                    explain the whole connection over time, he still exposes it skillfully to' public view.</p>

        <p>With immigration having had the most fundamental impact on the demographic development of North
                    America, immigrant letters—especially those written by the millions of nineteenth-century

            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> and in the respective "old country." The present
                    work—based on a 1988 <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
          </placeName>-language edition—is the result of transatlantic cooperation and is the first

                    "This Edition" (25 pp.) takes up selection and editing criteria and the crucial
                    question of handling the inherent discrepancy in numerous immigrant correspondences: the desire to
                    communicate via letter and the writer's handicap with spelling and punctuation. This
                    nightmare of transcribers and translators is hardly evident in the present sanitized English version

          </placeName> immigrant letters. Only a few examples of misspellings, mostly geographic in nature,
                    are retained, and they serve as reminders also of the newcomers' early struggle with a
                    foreign tongue (Yndianaponis, Indianaponis, Indianaponnis—but, after three months,

        <p>The roughly 350 letters of this volume were selected from the growing Emigrants' Letter
                    Collection at the Ruhr Universitaet Bochum (ca. 5,000 at this time). Only series of letters were
                    considered, "sequences of letters written by one person or members of one family over a
                    period of several years," for "a series provides evidence of the process of change
                    in circumstances and attitudes such as an individual's adaptation and integration into the
                    society of his new home" (p. 45). Aware of the usual overrepresentation of the highly
                    educated in immigrant history, the editors offer a historically more justifiable socioeconomic
                    stratification. The letters are then divided into those of "Farmers" (210 pp.),
                    "Workers" (200 pp.), and "Domestic Servants" (67 pp.). Each of
                    the letter writers is introduced with succinct information as to origin and environment in the home
                    region and in the new American setting, all meticulously documented. The letters proper are
                    carefully abbreviated from their originals, with bracketed cue words giving contents of omissions.</p>

          </placeName>: Greenwood Press, 1991. Pp. viii, 157. Notes, note on sources, index.
                    $39.95.)</head>
        <p>In <hi rend="i">Women of the Grange</hi> Donald B. Marti seeks to define the roles which women played
                    in that agricultural organization as well as to uncover ways in which their participation therein
                    led them to be a part of the women's movement. He argues that the Grange's
                    structure, which included women from the first, reflected the mutuality of rural life that has been
                    documented by other scholars. Both in the Grange and on the farm, men and women worked and lived
                    together—mutuality. At the same time Grange activities gave rural women a chance to
                    socialize with one another and cooperatively to serve their common interests as mothers, wives, and
                    farm women—sisterhood.</p>
        <p>By looking at the activities, writings, and lives of leading women in the Grange, Marti outlines the
                    roles women played in that society and tries to explain what the organization meant to its women
                    members. He traces the evolution of women's roles from the symbolic offices of Ceres,
                    Pomona, and Flora, which positions women held in Grange ritual in the early years, to their more
                    substantial participation as lecturers and assistant stewards. In the 1880s they gained a place in
                    the regional and national levels of the organization, and by the twentieth century women were a
                    majority of the lecturers and even filled the highest offices at local and state levels.</p>

        <p>Marti develops a collective portrait of active women in the Grange. He finds that they tended to be
                    well educated and were generally religious. They shared a domestic focus and were concerned with the
                    need to reduce the drudgery of farm women's work through efficient and modern methods. The
                    women's writings in the Grange publications that Marti surveyed frequently touched on this
                    topic and offered myriad suggestions for improvements to the farm home. Although most of these women
                    saw their responsibilities as principally domestic, they were also attentive to issues of <pb
            id="VAA4025-089-1-077" n="71"/> "public housekeeping." Active Grange women supported
                    temperance and suffrage and persuaded the organization (contrary to assurances of its founders) that
                    this latter cause was a "clear implication of its first principles" (p. 148). They
                    also engaged in a variety of community improvement campaigns through their Women's
                    Committees and their work with the juvenile Grange.</p>

        <p>Marti makes use of a wide variety of sources and provides a strong introduction and an informative
                    bibliographic essay, both of which comment upon recent work in the history of rural women and the
                    Grange movement. <hi rend="i">Women of the Grange</hi> is a useful addition to the scholarship on

            </placeName>, 1880–1940</hi> is a provocative contribution to debates among
                    researchers on rural women. Contrary to the view that rural women experienced more egalitarian
                    marriages because of their shared labor and essential economic contributions to the family farm,
                    Fink concludes that rural women in <placeName>

                    (and that of their children) was exploited, and their isolation deprived them of community support
                    that made them more vulnerable to domestic violence (p. 190). Fink has no patience for the
                    continuing glorification of agrarianism. Defining it as "the belief in the moral and
                    economic primacy of farming over industry" and the "superiority of farm
                    life" over urban life, she asserts that this "false" and
                    "irrelevant" ideology, which incorporates women only as subordinate appendages to
                    men, has provided a woefully inadequate basis for public policies (p. 11, 12, 194).</p>
        <p>Her case study assesses the impact of geography, class, and gender on the lives of rural women and
                    illustrates why the experiences of agrarian women defy facile generalization. The bleak, treeless,
                    and arid plains of Nebraska presented special challenges to farm families—difficulties
                    not encountered in the more humid cornbelt regions of <placeName>

          </placeName>, or Indiana.
                    Without trees, settlers lived in dugouts or soddies; without water, their crops failed. One finds
                    abundant evidence of neighborliness among rural <pb

            <region reg="nbu" type="state">Nebraska</region>
          </placeName>, Fink argues that isolation was common, especially for poorer women. Landless families
                    moved frequently and failed to develop close friendships and social networks, but even women in more
                    prosperous farm families experienced physical and emotional isolation. By the end of the 1930s Fink
                    notes that only 17 percent of <placeName>
            <region type="county">Boone County</region>
          </placeName> farms were accessible by graveled or hard-surfaced roads. It was usually men who went
                    to town and saw friends and women who remained at home. The influence of class affected other
                    aspects of rural women's lives: food provisions, housing and furnishings, and most
                    importantly, the nature of work performed on the farm. As in Indiana, women living on marginal
                    farming operations were the most likely to engage in field work themselves and to witness
                    interruptions or terminations of their children's educations because they were needed as
                    unpaid farm laborers.</p>
        <p>Fink perceives the 1930s as the pivotal decade for rural women of all classes. "…
                    agrarian life was crumbling," and women found that despite their extra work they could not
                    "ease the burdens of the depression …" (p. 129). <placeName>
            <region type="county">Boone County</region>
          </placeName> women rejected the agrarian life in several ways: leaving farms in large numbers,
                    remaining single, divorcing, and if married, becoming "less tied to the farm
                    economy" (pp. 129–30). Fink's discussion of the fundamental changes in
                    this decade is convincing and based on an impressive variety of sources.</p>
        <p>Among the most valuable sources in <hi
            rend="i">Agrarian Women</hi> are Fink's interviews
                    with over thirty-five women. Since the quotations from her fieldwork are so illuminating, it is
                    regrettable that she did not incorporate more of the women's own words into her <hi
            rend="i">text</hi>. More troubling, her conclusions that struggles <hi
            rend="i">to</hi> survive
                    led to alienation rather than bonding between husbands and wives and that an intrinsically violent
                    Plains culture, coupled with women's isolation, made them more susceptible to the brutal
                    rages of spouses are based on inadequate evidence and rely heavily on Mari Sandoz's <hi rend="i">Old Jules</hi>, an account of her father. Fink's contention that the book
                    about a gifted intellectual who "beat and tyrannized his wives and children" and
                    "refused to do farm work" was widely read in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Boone County</region>
          </placeName> and that "men admired Old Jules and sought to emulate him" is
                    unsubstantiated (p. 78). Questions about behavior within marriages are crucial in debates on the
                    lives of rural women, but as Fink's generally fine study demonstrates, this private
                    behavior is also the most difficult to document.</p>

        <p>After the Civil War the federal government freed four million African Americans and, through the
                    urgency of Radical Republicans, guaranteed constitutional rights for black people with the
                    Reconstruction amendments. With their newfound freedom African Americans set out to be responsible
                    American citizens, committed to the Protestant work ethic, education, and the success of future
                    generations. Unfortunately, African Americans soon learned that freedom for them meant greater
                    limitations to equal opportunities than for other Americans. Historian Rayford W. Logan in <hi rend="i">The Betrayal of the Negro: From R#2 B. Hayes to Woodrow Wilson</hi> (1965) termed the
                    era "the nadir" in reference to oppressive measures meted out to Americans of
                    African descent. The period 1910–1925, which Carole Marks and James R. Grossman address
                    in their respective studies, represents another of America's failed promises of democracy
                    in regard to African-American citizens. Marks and Grossman agree with Logan's assessment,
                    showing also that as late as the 1940s, and after seeking better conditions in the North, African
                    Americans could not gain equal access to American freedoms.</p>
        <p>Both authors describe the political, social, and economic problems African Americans confronted in
                    the South in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Terrorism, the grandfather clause,
                    literacy tests, and poll taxes removed black males' right to the vote. Jim Crow laws
                    limited African Americans' access in public transportation, theaters, and recreational
                    facilities. Segregated housing and schools, generally inferior, resulted in shortfalls for black
                    children who had to struggle against institutional racism that followed them to adulthood. Peonage
                    and sharecropping further exploited black workers. Sporadic violence almost always compelled black
                    people to leave the South. Grossman summarizes white people's failure to understand the
                    needs of black people as the main problem. He traces the phenomenon back as far as the American
                    Revolution when African Americans fought for the British because colonists refused to let them fight
                    for America. If white Americans could have understood that black people wanted no more than white
                    Americans enjoyed, the situation could have been positively better by the early twentieth century.</p>

        <p>If migrants could be motivated by factors that pushed them from the South, they could find great hope
                    in factors that Grossman <pb
            id="VAA4025-089-1-080" n="74"/> summarized as "bettering my
                    condition" (p. 6). The better conditions included various aspects of political, social, and
                    economic equality, not the least of which was the greater control of one's work hours and
                    wages, however meager. Personal independence, therefore, proved to be the greatest impulse for
                    movement. The key pull factor for northern movement was the willingness of white employers to
                    experiment with black workers at a time when European immigrants almost completely stopped coming to
                    America.</p>
        <p>While both authors cite the general push-pull factors relating to the movement of black people to the
                    North, each offers a unique view of the Great Migration. Marks, looking at the South in general for
                    information on black migrants, concludes that largely urban skilled laborers, not the general
                    agricultural workers, left the South for perceived equal opportunities in the North. She also finds
                    that the slow growth of southern industrialism forced them to look to the North for greater
                    opportunity. Furthermore, she says that "mobilization … was orchestrated in the
                    board rooms of northern industrial enterprises" (p. 3). Marks also pays attention to
                    women's contributions to the Great Migration. Black women's work usually fell in
                    the category of domestic service, which often meant that they fared less well than male workers.
                    Marks's location of the migrants included points North in general. She often compares black
                    migrants to immigrants, sometimes failing to comprehend fully African Americans'
                    limitations prescribed by racism, a factor that did not restrict immigrants to the same degree.</p>
        <p>Grossman looks largely at black migration to the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName> area from <placeName>
            <region reg="msu" type="state">Mississippi</region>, <region reg="lau"

          </placeName>, and <placeName>
            <region reg="tnu" type="state">Tennessee</region>
          </placeName>. His discussion details the South from which largely rural migrants came and the North
                    where they created a new world based on an industrial order. He finds that the African-American
                    world view shaped by race in the South was also shaped by race in the North. Black people continued
                    to rely on "the comfort and familiarity of black institutions" (p. 8).
                    Furthermore, Grossman documents the intricate networks (kinship, friendship, and professional) that
                    show how readily black people relied on each other in the migration process. The <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName>
          <hi rend="i">Defender's</hi> transition from an objector to migration supporter, for
                    example, proved just as important as relatives who sent letters of encouragement, paid for train
                    tickets, or provided housing to migrants upon their arrival in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName>. The support network involved in the migration process—both during and
                    after—proved as complex as the intricate levels of black culture. Grossman is convinced
                    that the migration process was successful because migrants relied on black culture and also that the
                    migration strengthened African-American culture.</p>

        <p>Marks concentrates on economic aspects of the Great Migration although she too relies on the theme of
                    the African-American <pb
            id="VAA4025-089-1-081" n="75"/> cultural consciousness; a poem,
                    "For Mother and Dad," the last line of which,
                    "Farewell—we're good and gone," becomes her book title.
                    Grossman's assessment of the Great Migration is centrally focused on cultural
                    consciousness. Each author's approach is unique and different, but each builds on the
                    growing scholarship of the subject and an understanding of the migrants and their impact on
                    twentieth-century industrial development. Both authors, however, end on a note of pessimism: almost
                    every African American who moved North in search of fulfilling America's promise of
                    democracy found further disappointment. Marks summarizes it best when she says, "Reality
                    never matched the dream of the Great Migration" (p. 3).</p>

        <p>Highlighting recent scholarship on the Great Migration, this slender volume (based primarily on
                    book-length works) attempts to go beyond documenting the usual sources, causes, and consequences of
                    African-American population movement. The collection of essays not only emphasizes the ways in which
                    African Americans have shaped their own migration experiences but also illuminates differences in
                    the sources and in the impact of black migration on different cities.</p>
        <p>Peter Gottlieb, for instance, in his essay, "Rethinking the Great Migration,"
                    explores black migration to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
          </placeName> by extending his analysis backward into the pre-World War I era and forward into the
                    Great Depression, World War 11, and beyond. Gottlieb argues that although these periods of migration
                    preceding and following the 1916–1930 era profoundly influenced the development of
                    African-American communities, their dynamics grew from trends that were different from those of the
                    Great Migration. Shirley Anne Moore observes an important variant on the black migration theme in
                    her essay on black migration to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>, <region reg="cau" type="state">California</region>
          </placeName>. She discovers that the process by
                    which black Richmondites entered into the urban industrial work force was more prolonged than
                    elsewhere, beginning slowly before the 1930s and accelerating during World War II as African
                    Americans moved into the shipyards in growing numbers.</p>
        <p>In his essay on black migration to Norfolk, <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>

          </placeName>, Earl Lewis emphasizes the dynamic role of African-American kin, friend, and communal
                    networks in the migration process. He presents a well-documented and convincing analysis of
                    "visiting" as <pb
            id="VAA4025-089-1-082" n="76"/> "one strategy adopted
                    by African-Americans to counter the potentially deleterious effects of extra-local
                    residence" (p. 31). Both Lewis and Joe William Trotter observe how African-American
                    migration patterns have largely been misinterpreted. Lewis notes that "South to North has
                    been confused with rural to urban migration" (p. 22). Likewise, Trotter finds that black
                    migration to southern Appalachia "was neither rural to urban nor rural to rural, but rather
                    rural to rural-industrial" (p. 46).</p>
        <p>The impact of southern black culture and community life is brilliantly highlighted in James R.
                    Grossman's essay on race, class, and unionism in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName> from 1916–1922. Migrants predisposed toward unionization constituted a small
                    minority. Grossman reveals that most black southernero—those who knew anything about
                    unions—had learned to be suspicious of organized labor. "Unlikely to become a
                    part of the black community, unions had even less chance of being perceived as external institutions
                    that—like schools—were self-evidently beneficial and amenable to incorporation
                    into Afro-American tradition" (p. 95). Thus, while unionization offered one possible means
                    of improving their condition, most migrants only "flirted" with unions.</p>
        <p>Although all of the authors demonstrate a keen awareness of the importance of looking at gender,
                    Darlene Clark Hine's essay on black migration to the urban Midwest focuses wholly on this
                    topic. "As enlightening and pathbreaking" as the recent black migration studies
                    are, Hine argues that "there remains an egregious void concerning the experience of black
                    women migrants" (p. 128). Hine challenges historians to focus on the sexual and the
                    personal impetus for black women's migration, paying more attention to the noneconomic
                    motives.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="i">The Great Migration in Historical Perspective</hi> offers an impressive balance of
                    theory and historical content as it explores the meaning of the thesis that "the Great
                    Migration of the early twentieth century represents for African-Americans both immigration and
                    freedom" (p. ix), which is put forth by Nell Irvin Painter in the book's
                    provocatively executed foreword. While the collection's quality and range in scope suggest
                    the advancement of black migration studies within the larger field of black urban history, the
                    volume's length of 160 pages (notes, table, and index included) gives further credence to
                    the authors' call for additional monographs in this area.</p>

        <p>
          <hi rend="i">A Case Study of Mainstream Protestantism</hi> is another example of the rapidly
                    developing interest among historians in the more recent history of the "mainline"
                    Protestant denominations. Spurred by present-day massive membership losses among those church
                    bodies, and the need, in part, to explain why, and funded generously by the Lilly Endowment in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName>, these studies are providing for the first time a detailed understanding of the recent
                    history of key and long-established groups in American Protestantism.</p>
        <p>This book follows a format already established by the Presbyterians in a series of volumes edited by <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
          </placeName> Coalter, John Mulder, and Louis Weeks. Editor D. Newell Williams places a large number
                    of brief essays on a wide variety of topics inside the covers of a single book in contrast to the
                    Presbyterians' decision to publish seven small but separate volumes, each on a single,
                    unified theme. This reader feels that Williams attempts too much in one large effort. The essays
                    focus especially on theological-biblical and educational trends among the Disciples over the last
                    century and also analyze very recent developments in the denomination, using statistical data and
                    social science techniques to provide some understanding of the large declines in membership among
                    the Disciples in the past two decades. The editor includes a very useful introductory essay that
                    helps to tie together thematically much of the material, but the book seems unbalanced in its
                    treatment of topics and bears too much the earmarks of the conferences of church people and
                    academics that spawned it.</p>
        <p>At several points <hi
            rend="i">A Case Study</hi> hints at racial conflicts within the denomination,
                    yet there is no systematic consideration of that important but still neglected subject (such an
                    essay was presented verbally but not prepared for print). A young historian who recently has
                    reflected sensitively about women in American Protestantism wrote an essay for this
                    book—but not about women among the Disciples of Christ! This reviewer also regrets that
                    there was no attempt to explore fully the historical significance of the large schisms that since
                    1880 have at times bedeviled the Disciples. If examined closely, these rendings of the
                    denominational garments surely would have provided significant insights into the socioreligious
                    nexus of the Disciples in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. And an essay devoted to the
                    Disciples' attraction-repulsion <pb
            id="VAA4025-089-1-084" n="78"/> with major American
                    expressions of ecumenism such as the Federal or National Councils of Churches might have illuminated
                    the denomination's commitments in the twentieth century to its historic belief in Christian
                    unity.</p>
        <p>Despite these questionings this book constitutes an important first effort in establishing the recent
                    history of a significant group within American Protestantism, a group rooted throughout its history
                    in the Midwest and especially in Indiana. One hopes that this set of essays will encourage further
                    investigations so that an almost complete picture of this distinctive, Hoosier-influenced church can
                    be achieved.</p>

            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> Cable once called the "Silent South" became vocal in decrying the
                    cost to the South of white racism. Southern white liberals from the academy, the labor movement,
                    politics, and journalism joined with prominent African Americans to denounce the poll tax, advocate
                    passage of a federal antilynching law, publicize the South's special economic problems, and
                    agitate for an interracial liberal-labor-Negro coalition to supplant Dixie's white
                    supremacist Democratic parties. In 1938 a galaxy of prominent southern
                    progressives—one-third of them African American—met in Birmingham, <placeName>
            <region reg="alu" type="state">Alabama</region>
          </placeName>, in unseg-regated sessions, to establish the Southern Conference for Human Welfare.</p>

        <p>The brief, yet vital, history of the SCHW, and of its successor, the Southern Conference Educational
                    Fund, has been recounted before, notably in Thomas Krueger's <hi
            rend="i">And Promises to
                        Keep</hi> (1967) and in Irvin Klibaner's doctoral dissertation on the SCEF. Many of the
                    key individuals and issues associated with the SCHW and SCEF have been the subject of fine recent
                    biographies and monographs. But never before Linda Reed's <hi rend="i">Simple Decency
                        &amp; Common Sense: The Southern Conference Movement, 1938–1963</hi> has the
                    mission of these reformers been so exhaustively researched, deftly analyzed, comprehensively
                    examined, and so sensitively, so compassionately portrayed.</p>

        <p>Reed argues that the campaigns of the Southern Conference Movement laid the groundwork for the
                    militant civil rights movement of the 1960s. To buttress that contention she has mined the <pb
            id="VAA4025-089-1-085" n="79"/> papers of the SCHW and SCEF as well as those of the National
                    Association for the Advancement of Colored People and of Anne and Carl Braden, James Dombrowski,
                    Virginia Foster Durr, Clark Foreman, and Frank Porter Graham, among others. In addition, she has
                    perceptively made use of a wide range of journalistic and secondary sources. The result is a
                    definitive history of the SCHWs activities, the consequences of red-baiting on the movement, the
                    wartime battle against the poll tax and racial discrimination, the Henry Wallace campaign of 1948
                    and the end of the SCHW, and the efforts of the SCEF to continue the mission by promoting
                    integration in education.</p>

        <p>While not every scholar will accept all of Reed's interpretations, especially those
                    concerning the reasons for the SCHWs demise, the positive role of the Bradens, or the links of
                    continuity between wartime liberalism and the direct-action movement of the 1960s, this is a

        <p>These two thoughtful books examine, each in its own manner, the profoundly important question of how
                    American society comprehends its past. Both understand that historical images are not merely
                    recorded but rather are constructed through selection and interpretation of information in light of
                    current perceptions and values. As critical as this history making is to the society's
                    appreciation of its own merits, flaws, needs, and resources, not to mention its essential character,
                    neither John Bodnar nor Michael Kammen finds that it has been carried out rationally,
                    dispassionately, or comprehensively. As a result, public memory of America's past is
                    fundamentally mythic, with images of nationalism and progress at its core. For better or worse
                    public memory rests upon symbols sculpted by influential individuals and groups to enhance certain
                    interests, ideas, and values. It must nevertheless be taken seriously, for as Kammen writes,
                    "What people believe to be true <pb
            id="VAA4025-089-1-086" n="80"/> about their past is
                    usually more important in determining their behavior and responses than truth itself" (pp.
                    38–39).</p>
        <p>Kammen's <hi rend="i">Mystic Chords of Memory</hi> examines American historical culture over
                    two centuries. He finds little governmental or social concern with the past before 1870. Thereafter,
                    artists and authors eager to demonstrate American progress and a political culture determined to do
                    likewise began finding it worthwhile to compare the present with the past. The three decades after
                    1915 in particular witnessed rising interest in the past. Private collectors of folk culture, most
                    notably Henry Ford with <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
          </placeName> Village and John D. Rockefeller with Colonial <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
          </placeName>, played pivotal roles in fostering a public sense of the past as distant and detached.
                    At the same time the federal government directed attention to a few notable places, events, and
                    persons by means of national parks and other initiatives. Local and regional efforts stimulated
                    particular memories. After World War II celebratory and commercial elements of remembrance became
                    ever stronger. Terms such as tradition and heritage became touchstones of an increasingly positive,
                    often wistful perception of the American experience.</p>
        <p>Bodnar's <hi rend="i">Remaking America</hi> focuses more specifically on the twentieth
                    century and the tension between official and popular, or what Bodnar calls vernacular, constructions
                    of the past. By examining the efforts of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
          </placeName> to cultivate a sense of community and several immigrant groups to celebrate their
                    ethnic identity, Bodnar illuminates ways in which civic authorities and ordinary people recast the
                    past in different ways to suit their particular purposes. Commemorations of midwestern settlement or
                    statehood as well as the evolution of the National Park Service illustrate official efforts to stir
                    patriotism. These civic remembrances contrast with a growing grassroots preference, particularly
                    after World War II, for recollection of personal matters devoid of nationalistic undercurrents. To
                    Bodnar the clash of official versus vernacular remembrance became particularly evident in disputes
                    over a <placeName>
            <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
          </placeName> Memorial between those who pursued overarching interpretations of the war and those who
                    sought an individualistic signification of soldiers' sacrifice.</p>
        <p>Both Kammen and Bodnar regard the Civil War centennial as an important manifestation of the
                    construction of public memory. Kammen dwells on the self-serving, content-empty nature of various
                    official and public commemorations. Bodnar emphasizes the federal effort to stress national unity,
                    which effort produced a carefully balanced treatment of Nohh and South as well as a tendency to
                    downplay the racial conflict at the core of the struggle. Public memory of the Civil War as
                    generated by its centennial, both scholars suggest, bore limited resemblance to its history.</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-089-1-087" n="81"/>
        <p>Neither of these stimulating works fully considers what sort of historical memory best serves the
                    public. Bodnar's more tightly constructed and cogently written volume provides the superior
                    introduction, while Kammen's offers greater anecdotal richness. Each suggests in its own
                    fashion how ill-served is a society that acquires from its past only congratulatory and comforting
                    images of patriotic traditions, heroic elites, and triumphant progress. Thus both books deserve a
                    careful reading by all concerned with how Americans obtain their understanding of the past and how
                    that might be improved.</p>

                    describes a slower, friendlier, small-town life during the gaslight era, a time of hired girls,
                    hopscotch on the sidewalk, and sleigh rides. Meant to be neither an autobiography nor a historic
                    chronicle of a period, the book is instead Kimbrough's attempt "to write something
                    about a happy childhood in America. … It is only an effort to say aloud some of the
                    things which the smell of burning leaves in the Fall brings back to my mind every year" (p.

                    considerable emphasis on nature study. Modern critics, as did those in Stratton-Porter's
                    day, can fault the author for her literary style and decry her "sugary
                    sentimentality," yet read in the context of the rising social problems and disillusionment
                    of the early twentieth century, the book is revelatory in its emphasis on honesty, integrity,
                    determination, hard work, and happy endings. <pb

                    Rather than discussing westward expansion as a process shaping the American character, this study

                    gathering midwestern foodways. Unfortunately the product was left to spoil because of wartime
                    mobilization. Today, however, it has been "warmed up" with the help of Chef Louis
                    Szathméry, who has tested and rewritten many of the recipes. Hoosier romantics will

                    <p>Hull House leaders did not have a pluralist view of society during the years
                                            1890 to 1919. Yet their concept of humanitarian social democracy and their
                                            benign policies of assimilation created a dynamic that unintentionally paved
                                            the way for a more pluralist view of society in the 1930s. Their opposition
                                            to the compulsory eradication of differences, their insistence that
                                            immigrant cultures be tolerated, contributed to the redefinition of
                                            liberalism in the 1930s. It was the inner logic of these attitudes that
                                            advanced the cause of pluralism.</p>

                <p>Professor Lissak has not responded to my criticism: that "her evidence often
                                    does not support her conclusions"; that she "regularly fails to
                                    recognize ambiguity and problems of evidence"; and that "she
                                    simply ignores critiques of cultural pluralism by John Higham, Arthur Mann, and
                                    Stephan Thernstrom, among others."</p>

            rend="i">Editor's Note</hi>. This list of articles, books, pamphlets, and dissertations
                    published from 1988 to 1992 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's
                    history. We hope to present such a list in each March issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi>. We recognize that the list is neither complete nor systematic in coverage, and we
                    hope that readers will help us by sending items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested
                    in listing publications that make some contribution to understanding Indiana's past but
                    that are not normally reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or
                    accounts of local historical society activities, but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles
                    may be listed. All such items for the March, 1994, issue must be received by November 1, 1993. Many
                    people have contributed to the present list, but major responsibility has rested with Leigh Darbee
                    of the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
