                    schools. Neither public nor private as those terms are understood today, most of these schools
                    operated on monies from several sources; most also required students to pay a subscription rate, or
                    tuition. In their own way the schools represented different responses to the needs of a growing,
                    increasingly diverse community. Teachers, a varied group that could only loosely be designated
                    professional, operated to a great extent as entrepreneurs. In the 1850s and 1860s, however, as
                    public schools—also called free schools or common schools—began to supplant
                    these earliest educational ventures, organization and financing of schools, work lives of teachers,
                    and composition of the educational work force changed dramatically. A study of schooling as it

                    their conditions of work, provides a new perspective on the development of teaching as a profession,
                    on the growth of public education in Indiana and the nation as a whole, and on current debates about
                    the future of public education.</p>
            <p>Educational historians have long been interested in the question of what social, economic, political,
                    cultural, and ideological forces encouraged the emergence of public schooling in the <placeName>

                    tie political and cultural developments more explicitly to the evolving economic system, are
                    particularly helpful for studying teachers as an emerging labor force. An examination of the history
                    of Fort <placeName>

                    part of the development of a national market economy. Although Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> was a small settlement at the time that larger, older cities were in the forefront of
                    economic, cultural, industrial, and educational expansion, its history parallels on a less grand
                    scale the developments in larger cities. Because of the city's relatively smaller size, changes in
                    its educational labor force are all the more visible.</p>

                    industrializing city in the nineteenth century had been at the crossroads of trade from its earliest
                    days as a military outpost and fur trading center on the edge of the frontier. Indiana became a
                    state in 1816, and on April 19, 1819, the fort at Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName> passed from military to civil authority. In 1822 Congress opened the area for public
                    sale of lands, excluding the forty acres of the fort. The relatively cheap land enticed new
                    settlers. Internal improvements in transportation, from plank roads and canals in the 1830s and
                    1840s to railroads in the 1850s, kept Fort <placeName>

                    French and American settlers from eastern and southern states populated the area in the earliest
                    years. In the 1830s and 1840s German, Irish, and French immigrants were attracted to jobs,
                    particularly those related to the internal improvements. Farming opportunities also attracted
                    settlers, as did the numerous and varied religious congregations.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    </placeName>'s economic development in the mid-nineteenth century came to be more industrial and
                    more influenced by northern states' trade and immigration patterns than were cities in middle and
                    southern Indiana. Educationally, however, Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> shared a common heritage with other Hoosiers and other mid-westerners. As Indiana
                    evolved out of the Northwest Territory, it inherited the educational legacy spelled out in the Land
                    Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The 1785 legislation allocated for the
                    purposes of education the land (or the proceeds from lease or sale thereof) in section sixteen of
                    each congressional township; that is, one square mile in a six-square-mile township. The Northwest
                    Ordinance further declared: "Schools and the means of education shall forever be
                        encouraged."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The enabling legislation for Indiana statehood in
                    1816 included the essence of these ordinances, and many communities throughout the state established
                    small, one-room district schools. Money from the sixteenth section was frequently insufficient to
                    support such schools, however, thus most also charged a subscription fee. Private venture,
                    entrepreneurial, and denominational schools emerged simultaneously, especially in towns and cities;
                    almost certainly they, too, received section sixteen—or public—funds. Until
                    states explicitly allowed cities to establish separate school systems, a change that came in Indiana
                    with the common school legislation of the 1850s, educational opportunities in towns and villages
                    were much the same as those in rural areas, and schools were funded in much the same way. In

                    McCoy had been appointed by the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions but received little financial
                    support from it. He sent out appeals for money to individuals and to the federal and state
                    governments; all eventually responded. Although McCoy's intent was to teach Native American
                    children, his first class of twenty-five pupils included ten English scholars, six French, eight
                    Indians, and one African American. Those numbers reached forty-two by the end of the year.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    wild notion" for she had thought about it seriously and believed it was her duty to go:
                    "I have been living for self long enough and I think it is high time that I use my

                    women started their school with seventeen scholars, about half of whom were Catholic, but who,
                    according to Man, made "no objection to reading in and learning a verse in the testament
                    every morning." The women charged $2.50 per quarter for reading scholars,
                    $4.00 for writing and the higher studies, and $6.00 extra for painting.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> by one of the city's prominent businessmen, German Lutheran Henry Rudisill. Hoover
                    supplemented a modest stipend from the American Home Mission Society by taking in boarders and
                    organizing the tuition school. The Lutherans had as yet no church building of their own, and the
                    Presbyterians had no minister; Hoover preached to both on a provisional basis from the Presbyterian
                    church building.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>Working for Hoover was easier than running an independent school, according to Man. Also, the
                    basement room in the church was "a beautiful room for a school," for it was
                    "fitted up with oaken desks and walls painted for a blackboard so that there will be plenty
                    of room for Arithmetic and Maps." Susan reported that she and Alida got along well in the
                    school for "Mr. Hoover lets us have our own way as much as we could in an independent
                        school."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Although operating out of a church and run by a minister
                    assisted by young teachers who saw opportunities for "promoting the gospel," the
                    school was not affiliated with a specific church. Religion was, however, central to its curriculum.
                    Man relates that Hoover opened and closed the school each day with prayers. "The scholars
                    all meet in his room in the morning. After prayer we take our scholars into our own room and teach
                    them until it is time to close." The women teachers were each paid $250.00,
                    "part in advance for two terms five months each."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even though their pay was modest, the young women felt successful in their teaching, appreciated by
                    their students, and accepted by the community. To save money they boarded 'round, as was the
                    practice for teachers then, with families whose children attended the school. Man explained that
                    they paid "$2-1/2 per week for our board &amp; get our washing done as we
                    can, sometimes we do it ourselves and sometimes get it done at the rate of 75 cts. a dozen. I think
                    we shall just about pay our way home next summer—and have very little left."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Man, however, felt rewarded by the students' learning. <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </quote> A former student of the two young women claimed that they "did away with the raw
                    hides and hickory goads that the male teachers had in their schools. The ladies were successful and
                    well liked by their pupils."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> The women enjoyed an active social life
                    filled with callers, parties, teas, and church-related activities. They appear to have been included

            <p>The opening of other tuition schools posed a threat to the profitability, as well as to the very
                    existence, of Hoover's school. In the spring of 1837 Man notes that their school had new

            <p>In the fall of 1845 Mrs. Lydia A. Sykes opened a Ladies' Seminary under the auspices of the
                    Presbyterian church. The Presbyterians had recently split into Old and New School divisions. Old
                    School Presbyterians started the school, but the school's board had ministers from both
                    congregations. The board also included ministers from other churches and prominent citizens such as,

            <p>In 1853 a Presbyterian academy was again opened by the First Presbyterian Church (Old School) under

                    </placeName>'s public schools also opened in 1853 but closed in 1854 for lack of funds and support.
                    When they were reopened in 1857, Irvin, now the Reverend George A. Irvin, was hired to be the first
                    superintendent of schools.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> The Presbyterian academy was temporarily suspended,
                    but it was reopened and continued with varying success until 1867 when it was abandoned because the
                    public schools "were more economically carrying out its objects."<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The lots were sold to the Fort <placeName>

            <p>In the 1840s Catholics also tried to organize schools and attract teachers and students. In 1843 a
                    young French-born priest, Julian Benoit of St. Augustine's Catholic Church, arranged to have Holy
                    Cross brothers teach in his St. Augustine's Institute. When they quit, he hired a lay schoolmaster,
                    William B. Walter, to open St. Augustine's Academy in the fall of 1844. By 1845 there were
                    eighty-four students, thirty girls and fifty-four boys, including four Protestants. St. Augustine's
                    advertised that instruction was not "select or sectarian." It was also less
                    expensive than other schools. The price for that year had been reduced to $1.75 per
                    quarter for the English branches, $3.00 for the classical, and $5.00 for
                    drawing and painting; but further reductions were made when there was "liberal patronage,
                    or where the circumstances of some may require it." The following semester the prices were
                    again reduced—"solely with an eye to the exclusion of <hi rend="i">none</hi>
                    from the great blessings of education"—as the school also tried to compete with
                    the city's other schools. Walter continued in the boys' school until 1847 when Father Benoit again
                    hired brothers from religious orders to teach. The school was abandoned in 1851.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Three nuns from the Sisters of <placeName>

            <p>Other congregations initiated religious schooling for their children but expanded the scope to
                    include all subjects. In the mid-1850s a small Jewish community appointed their newly hired cantor
                    to teach religious doctrine and Hebrew to children several times a week. In 1856 Mayer Eppstein, a
                    retired professional teacher of Hebrew and German from a synagogue school in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, took over the teaching of religion, Hebrew, and German. An English instructor was also
                    hired. The school was originally supported by the parents, but in 1860 the congregation took over
                    basic expenses. By 1864 the congregation threw its support behind the public schools. The Jewish
                    school continued, but only as a religious school on Sundays and after school hours.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

            <p>Other small schools taught by individual teachers or pairs of teachers came and went during the

                    Their insecure financial bases, the undeveloped teaching profession, and competition for students

                    </placeName>, as was typical of cities in northern Indiana, almost 75 percent approved,<hi rend="sup">57</hi> yet the state legislature passed no enabling legislation. In 1851 a new
                    Indiana constitution provided the groundwork for legislation that established an administrative
                    structure, as well as the funding, for a system of public schools. Civil townships were to be the
                    new unit of administration. The former congressional township funds would go to the state, not
                    directly to the townships, as had previously been the case. The state would then distribute the
                    funds according to student attendance in each township. Townships had new powers to tax, as did
                    cities and towns, which could form separate school corporations. The change from congressional

                    William Stewart. The trustees rented former teacher Alexander McJunkin's school building on the east

                    factions of the fragmenting Whig party favored public schools, as did, increasingly, various
                    Protestant churches, who feared growing Catholic immigration and the spread of Catholicism and saw
                    free schools as a way to counter both.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> The Whig group included most of the
                    "public spirited" citizens—businessmen, lawyers, and
                    clergy—who had been instrumental in initiating private venture and denominational schools
                    before the advent of public schools.</p>
            <p>Teachers were not disinterested bystanders. Catholic schoolmaster Walter spoke ardently for the
                    dissemination of the school funds to sectarian schools. Two of the first public schoolteachers, A.
                    N. Hulbard and Isaac Mahurin, both of whom had also taught in private schools, worked with free
                    school supporters in 1853 to promote the cause. Superintendent George A. Irvin, a Presbyterian
                    minister, expressed anti-Catholic fears and was an aggressive proponent of public schools.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

            <p>Although the public schools were closed from 1854 to 1857, the board of trustees pursued the building
                    of two schools. One opened in February and the other in the fall of 1857. Because of continuing
                    strife within the city, mirrored statewide, over the legality of taxing for schooling, private
                    funding was successfully solicited in Fort <placeName>

                    $500 each. The appeal for financial contributions failed in 1859, however, and the

                    allowed to run private schools in the public school buildings. The public schools reopened in
                    January, 1860, but were not financially sound until 1865 when a new school law was written for

                    Their efforts to promote subscription and denominational as well as public schools during the 1830s
                    and 1840s had shown that education could not depend on the initiative of private teachers or
                    religious congregations or even on partially funded district and county schools. The population of
                    Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> was growing, the economy industrializing, the need for a literate society increasing,
                    and the demand for education expanding. There was, however, no clear route to teaching as a
                    profession, no consistent way of insuring payment to teachers, thus no way of retaining teachers to
                    maintain consistent educational opportunities.</p>
            <p>In Indiana the legal framework for public schools was set in 1852, but the system progressed by fits
                    and starts, going back and forth from public to private venture, entrepreneurial, or denominational,
                    from publicly paid teachers to teachers paid according to other arrangements. Not until after the
                    Civil War did public schools in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, and in Indiana, operate on firm legal and financial footing. By the late 1860s and
                    1870s many of the subscription and denominational schools had folded or merged with the public
                    schools. Only the Catholic and Lutheran schools survived in what became parallel systems to the
                    public schools, systems that still thrive in Fort <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Before public schools, teaching as a "profession" was defined by those with
                    literary skills, which teachers exchanged for money or equivalents in kind. In Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> some subscription school teachers, both women and men, as exemplified by Man and
                    Steevens, lived quite well. Most had no specific training for teaching. A few women had received
                    some higher education at the then new women's schools in the East, others at female academies
                    throughout the Midwest; men had received training in theology, law, or business.
                    "Careers" in education were, for the most part, short, as tradition led men and
                    women out of teaching. Men went on to other careers; most single women married. Competition among
                    schools further shortened brief careers. Man noted the difficulty that competitors would have in

                            Whigs, very successful bankers and businessmen, and community-minded activists and

                            trained and remained in their positions long enough to oversee the development of the

                    rates, with further reductions for families with more than one child attending. By 1853 there were
                    many private venture and denominational schools in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, and the public schools had to enter the competition for scholars and teachers.</p>
            <p>During the first half of the nineteenth century lines between public, private, and denominational
                    schools were almost nonexistent. McCoy's missionary school took money from denominational, public,
                    and individual sources. The county seminary, a public institution, charged tuition, as did most
                    other schools. The school that opened in the Presbyterian church included religion in its
                    curriculum, but it was first taught by a Lutheran minister. The school also welcomed children of all
                    faiths, as did the Catholic schools. Teachers, such as Man and Hubbell, moved easily from a private
                    venture school to a denominational school. Some ministers, such as Hoover, taught in schools not of
                    their own faith or, as the Reverends Steevens, McJunkin, Large, and Battin, opened their own private
                    schools. Presbyterian minister Irvin, who headed the Presbyterian academy, was hired to be the first
                    superintendent of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s public schools. Battin, an Episcopalian minister, coveted Irvin's position when Irvin
                    resigned. Later the Presbyterians sold their school to the public schools, as would several other
                    denominations. Some of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s public schools were set up in what had been private venture schools, and a number of
                    teachers in those schools were hired as Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s first public school teachers.</p>
            <p>The teaching profession, as it is defined today, began to evolve with the advent of the public
                    schools. Increasingly, young, single women were hired to fill the new age-graded public schools in
                    Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> and throughout the country.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Before the establishment of the
                    public school system, "young," "single," and
                    "female" were not criteria for teaching in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. Although some young, single women did teach, so did married women, widowed women, and
                    single and married men. Men and women often worked together out of their homes—or a
                    schoolhouse, courthouse, jail, or church—as husband-wife, father-daughter,
                    brother-sister, sister-sister, or mother-daughter teams. Marital and family relationships helped to
                    define the work force.</p>

                    which they taught were unable to endure. As the state expanded its responsibilities to include
                    education, "teaching" was redefined. Teachers received wages for their labor, were

            <p>On May 18, 1852, Malinda Clark Slawson Pugh of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> gave birth to a son, Isaac Clark Pugh. By September Malinda was dead as a result of
                    complications associated with the delivery. Isaac Pugh, Malinda's husband at the time of her death,
                    informed his wife's former mother-in-law and father-in-law, Simeon and Martha Slawson, that Malinda
                    had died from the consequences of a "spongy fungus substance growing in the womb."
                    Doctors had taken out the substance, caused by failure to remove part of the placenta after the
                    childbirth, but it had grown back, resulting in Malinda's death.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Malinda had married Isaac Pugh on July 23, 1851, following the death of her first husband, Delanson
                    Slawson, six years earlier. After Delanson's death Malinda had taken care of her children and tended
                    the family farm alone. At the time of her marriage to Pugh, Malinda was in her forties and was
                    "beaten down" from hard work and debt. Pugh was fifteen years her senior and held
                    "20,000 in property and had one of the best farms in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Regardless of Malinda's liberation from the responsibilities of her own farm, she was too worn out to
                    have additional children with Pugh. Large families were common on the frontier, however, and many
                    women gave birth almost annually during their childbearing years. "Procreation was highly
                    encouraged… both to aid population growth and provide future laborers for the family farm
                    or other business." According to historian Glenda Riley's "conservative
                    estimate," the average family on the frontier had ten children, and these high fertility
                    rates contributed to a lax or "matter-of-fact attitude <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The high mortality rate resulting from childbirth and other diseases dispels many romantic notions of

                    had "repeatedly heard mothers say, that they had wept tears of bitterness over their infant
                    daughters, at the thought of sufferings which they were destined to undergo; while they cherished
                    the decided wish, that these daughters should never marry."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Cholera,
                    influenza, measles, "the fever," and other illnesses also caused many deaths.
                    During the 1840s Beecher "collected evidence that women were more often ill than well, and
                    that chronic disabilities were widespread among the female population."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Malinda Pugh's correspondence with her family corroborates Beecher's statements and provides

            <p>Although much of Delanson's correspondence with his mother and father dealt with illness, many of his
                    letters were filled with news about his farming activities. In one letter he wrote that he had
                    logged five acres during the day and that he had ten acres fenced, had bought an old peacock plow
                    for six dollars, and had thirty acres in corn, four in oats, and sixteen pigs a week old. Corn, he
                    said, sold for only twenty cents a bushel in the summer of 1840. He had procured ten barrels of salt
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> in November of 1840 and had sent a worker, "Uriah," to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in December of that year "with a drove of about 1,000 hogs." He added
                    that it took sixteen to eighteen days to complete such a task. Delanson boasted that he and Uriah
                    could "shuck sixty-five bushels of corn in a day and put it in a crib." He also
                    commented on economic hardships in other areas of Indiana. In January, 1845, people from adjacent <placeName>

            <p>The Slawsons were almost self-sufficient. Malinda made their clothing, preserved foodstuffs, and

                    Kessler-Harris notes, however, that the division of labor was not clearly defined. Although women
                    did the bulk of "internal domestic chores," husbands often did spinning and
                    weaving when farm work was complete, and "wives routinely developed competency in their

            <p>Malinda often scribbled a few lines in her husband's letters to the Slawsons. She told of milking
                    cows or making linen and reported that she had made "straw hats for the boys and sold <hi rend="i">6</hi> 1/2 pounds of butter a week." The children were attending school, she
                    wrote, and daughter Martha Jane was "very mischievous." In March of 1843 she
                    commented, Flavins "wishes to inform you that he has shed two of his teeth." The
                    Slawsons told their parents of friends from <placeName>

                    and Delanson mentioned other interesting events. In August, 1845, for example, Delanson related:
                    "court is now in session… 3 or 4 convicts for lower house for steeling and Negro
                        killing."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Much of Delanson and Malinda's correspondence reflects their loneliness. They complained when they
                    did not receive mail from family members. Malinda was sometimes critical of the Tarkingtons and her
                    brother Lewis for not writing. In March of 1842 she reported that she had not heard from the
                    Tarkingtons "since their babe was three weeks old." Evidently her complaints were
                    effective. In July she wrote that she had received a letter and that "they are all

            <p>Delanson and Malinda often wrote of religious matters in their letters.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> In 1840
                    they reported that there was "preaching" at their home "every 2
                    weeks." The Slawsons lived on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit, and the two circuit riders who visited them were named Berry and Smith. In
                    another letter Malinda mentioned a camp meeting that was to commence "in three
                        weeks."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> The Slawsons found comfort in their religion when
                    disaster struck. On February 2, 1841, Delanson informed his parents that his daughter Martha Jane
                    had died of the "scarlot fever." Flavins was the first to become ill with the
                    disease, but he had escaped death. Martha Jane was not so fortunate. Delanson reported that
                    "Br. Crawford preached her funeral sermon then she was taken to her cold and silent
                    grave." Malinda expressed much guilt over the death. She felt that she was being
                    "severely chastened of the Lord for my unfaithfulness to him." The day before
                    Martha Jane became ill, Malinda wrote, the child had gotten her hymn book and "sit in my
                    chair and sing with all her infant simplicity my prayer to God."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Family correspondence reveals that the Slawsons viewed a crippling injury or death as a
                    "warning for all to prepare for death."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Their religious
                    beliefs comforted and helped them through such tragedy. Malinda's mother-in-law, Martha, had dealt
                    with death and grief. Between December 27, 1830, and January 30, 1832, she lost five of her children
                    to typhoid.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Martha had also lost a child in 1814 and wrote that she had
                    "resign [ed] its Little Soul into the arms of God." In spite of Martha's pain, she
                    felt that it was sinful to grieve too much. She wrote to family members John and Rhoda Slawson,
                    "But Oh that we may consider our afflicktions aright and not ofend the lord by over
                    mourning for the Dead."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Studies of early nineteenth-century family life suggest that Calvinist stoicism, like Martha's, or
                    other forms of mourning did not completely suppress grief over the loss of a loved one, especially a
                        child.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Although religion provided solace for frontier families, death was
                    not taken lightly. One Iowa family, for example, "kept their dead child's miniature rocking
                    chair in the living room of their home for forty years after her demise."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> And historian Ann Douglas depicts women <list type="footnotes">

            <p>As a boy, John Tarkington spent his summers "during every long school-vacation" at
                    his Uncle Delanson's farm. John enjoyed visiting his uncle and playing with Albert since the boys
                    were near the same age. During the summers the two "wrestled with equal strength, had gone
                    paw-pawing, had harvested, had joyed in old-time country dances, frolicked in our work in the fields
                    and gone fishing in <geogName>White River</geogName>."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> John also
                    remembered an old song that he had learned there:</p>

               </p>
                </quote>
            <p>In September, 1845, Delanson died, at least in part because he had overworked himself doing the
                    "Fall-plowing" and "Fall wheat-sowing."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> He
                    was buried beside his daughter Martha Jane. Malin-da was devastated and left with five children. On
                    the evening of Delanson's death Tarkington reported that the family "met as usual, in the
                    family-room, and by the candlelight on the stand, the mother—(Malinda, honey sweet, as
                    was her name)," read the Twenty-third Psalm.</p>
            <p>Then, with all the family kneeling, she recited the Lord's Prayer. Tarkington observed: "an
                    awaiting silence followed, into which alone, slowly and falteringly, crept a low, tear-dropped
                        'Amen.'"<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At Delanson's death Malinda told thirteen-year-old Albert that he was not her natural child.
                    Tarkington reported that Albert was alarmed: "He looked around upon his brothers and
                    sisters of a moment ago, and they were not. He gazed open-mouthed and big-eyed upon his dying father
                    and heard the stumbling words of his mother as they fell sobbing between tears; and father and
                    mother had vanished." After a period of time one of Albert's relatives came to Indiana and
                    took the boy back to <placeName>

            <p>Malinda was faced with many hardships after Delanson's death. She was forced to take on her husband's
                    duties as well as continuing with her own domestic responsibilities. Although church members would
                    sometimes assist needy members of their congregations, towns and counties generally "had no
                    interest in supporting all women and children whose husbands or fathers had died or
                        deserted."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Malinda was no exception. Along with backbreaking work
                    and personal illness, she found herself in debt following her husband's death <list type="footnotes">

                    Simeon and Martha Slawson, she stated that she owed her brother-in-law, Joseph Tarkington, 150
                    dollars. In order to pay the debt she sold Delanson's carriage and harness. In the same letter
                    Malinda relayed that she had not given up her religious convictions and added, "the lord

            <p>In subsequent letters to the Slawsons, Malinda wrote that she had lost children to death and that her
                    father had perished. She had done the planting, harvesting, and butchering; made apple and pumpkin
                    butter; grown a truck patch; assisted in digging a well; and bought her dead husband a four-foot
                    tombstone with scriptures engraved on it. Malinda also taught Sabbath school and walked two miles to
                    church to hear ministers preach on such texts as "acknowledge God in all thy ways and He
                    shall direct thy steps."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> A "cold spell" in the

            <p>Other than cutting wood, Malinda performed every farm task that Delanson had previously done,
                    generally without the help of her eldest son, Flavins. Malinda probably did not require Flavins to
                    work very hard. Tarkington commented that "the boy was bright of wit, strong of muscle and
                    affectionate. If any difference was ever shown in the regard of the farmer and his wife for the
                    children it was in favor of that boy." In the spring of 1848 Flavins went to live with the
                    Slawsons on their farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName>. Malinda requested that his grandparents "send him to school" and
                    make him plow and plant. She wanted him to attend church and directed Flavins to "keep the
                    Sabbath… read the Bible… and write."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Flavins returned home in the fall of 1849 and planted four acres of wheat.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> He
                    did not remain long. By January, 1850, he was living with his Aunt Maluda and the Reverend John

                    wood used for cooking and heating and to feed the livestock. All the Slawson women believed in
                    education. Maluda, self-educated and creative, was no exception. She required her nephew to
                    "get two pages of philosophy every night." In 1851 Flavins enrolled in Indiana
                    Asbury at <placeName>

                    dollars from other people and donating 30 dollars of her own money in spite of her financial
                    difficulties. Malinda sold horses and other livestock simply "to get by."<hi rend="sup">51</hi>

            <p>In July, 1851, Malinda decided to marry Pugh. Feeling obligated to the Slawsons, she asked for their
                    permission. She had kept in close contact with her husband's parents because her own were dead.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Malinda stated that she had known Pugh many years and had discussed the
                    marriage with friends. She emphasized that she had suffered many hardships since Delanson's
                        death.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> The Slawsons agreed to the marriage.</p>
            <p>Malinda left her farm and moved to Pugh's estate. Although her financial difficulties were relieved,
                    she continued to be plagued by illness. To compound her health problems, she became pregnant in
                    September. Malinda and Pugh visited the Slawsons in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in late 1851. After their return on November 12, Malin-da's daughter Martha D. died of
                    scarlet fever—as had Martha Jane earlier—and was buried near her father.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Grief over the death of her daughter along with complications associated with the birth of her son
                    resulted in Malinda's death. "Unfortunately, gynecology was an area of medical practice
                    shrouded in ignorance, superstition, and nineteenth century standards of'modesty.' Variously
                    referred to as female ailments, complaints, weakness, diseases, difficulties, and problems, the
                    whole matter was seen as part of woman's lot in life."<hi rend="sup">56</hi> The demands of
                    the frontier killed Malinda as it had Delanson. Many women perished under the same conditions.</p>
            <p>Pugh buried Malinda beside her first husband. He wrote the Slawsons that he had given her clothes to
                    a Mrs. Samuel Walker, who was moving to <placeName>

            <p>History has not dealt kindly with women like Malinda Clark. Their efforts and accomplishments have
                    been overlooked, their place on the frontier rarely recognized. Yet their contributions to history,

                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, has resented that seventh counting of the nation's population with equally
                    deep emotions. Never had the country learned so much about itself since the decennial census began
                    in 1790. For the first time the published results revealed data about religious congregations, farm
                    acreage and value, and the geographical origins and migrations of Americans.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Despite this rich new information that added flesh and blood to the dry bones of previous

                    </placeName> were dismayed to learn that their community had lost 30 percent of its population and
                    had fallen from the ranks of the state's leading cities. The city had recently shown every sign of
                    health, prosperity, and growth, yet the federal tabulations were official and have been cited ever
                    since. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> had mysteriously shrunk—and then miraculously rebounded by almost 500
                    percent in the next census of 1860. Where had all the people gone and why? And how had the city
                    recovered so rapidly within a decade? Answers then lacking to explain this bust and boom phenomenon
                    are now available.</p>
            <p>Before the watershed census of 1850 Hoosiers had appeared in only three federal enumerations because
                    Indiana had become a state only in 1816. Prior to statehood demographic data for Indiana are sketchy
                    and anecdotal, but the three subsequent census reports chart a steady, predictable growth. Migrants
                    from the southern and east-em parts of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> moved into the southern and eastern parts of Indiana and gradually moved north and
                    west. First the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> valley communities developed, then the central
                    flatlands; and finally the northern swamps and dunes gave way to farms and industry. The National
                    Road cut across the state's midsection in the 1830s, bringing in easterners and commerce. The canal
                    mania of the late 1830s and 1840s attracted new people and enterprises along the water routes.

                    in 1840, Indiana rose from the eighteenth largest state to the tenth. The rapid development of

            <p>Early settlement in Indiana was predominantly rural. Although towns began to develop by the
                    mid-nineteenth century, they did not grow at the same pace as the rest of the state. Small by
                    today's standards, these rising centers of transportation, commerce, and industry nonetheless gave
                    focus and structure to Hoosier life. Paralleling settlement in the state, towns and villages
                    developed first in southern Indiana, then in central and northern areas. In the 1830 census no
                    cities in Indiana qualified as urban (defined as incorporated places with at least 2,500 residents),
                    but several were beginning to show promise of population growth. Both <placeName>

            <p>The 1850 census revealed much about Indiana that was expected. The Hoosier state had continued to

                    to seventh.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The Miami and Potawatomi tribes had been relocated to the west;
                    thus, Native Americans did not register in the headcount, not even those few who had contracted with

                    Andrew's Catholic and St. John's Lutheran churches, both of which served new German families.
                    African Americans, designated as "free colored," totaled 11,000, and it appeared

                    This racial distribution could easily have been predicted. Quakers in the upper Whitewater valley
                    were active in the Underground Railroad, and some of the runaway slaves remained in <placeName>

                    </placeName> was almost legendary by this time; and Bishop William Paul Quinn, a spiritual Johnny

                    townships—contradicted the official count. The 1853 state/township figure for <placeName>

                    grown rapidly. The discrepancies in the unofficial, the official, and the state/township figures
                    were difficult to understand. Federal census officials cited the state/township numbers in their <hi rend="i">Compendium</hi> to the seventh census, published in 1854, but did not repeat them in

                    "carefully taken." He then cited the 1853 state/township population of 3,800 as

                    </placeName>'s dilemma and questioned the validity of the 1850 census. Both of these historians once

                    </placeName>, became a librarian at Yale University, and spent several years researching and writing

                    decline of the city's population did not make sense to Knollenberg. Although the 1853 state/township
                    correction afforded some consolation, it was not enough. Because his location in <placeName>

                    </placeName> gold rush. Ultimately, Taylor found his own explanations "doubtful"
                    and cited evidence of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

                    1,401 and Park's second list of 42 and arrived at the official total of 1,443. For whatever reason,
                    they missed or lost or chose not to count Park's first list containing the names of 1,161 people
                    from the northern side of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Consequently, these names were omitted from the national count.</p>
            <p>The fragmented nature of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>

                    </placeName>. One can understand their confusion and sympathize with their situation. Pages were
                    handwritten, sometimes difficult to decipher. The fact that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> was divided into three sections created a problem. On these schedules someone has
                    written notes which indicate that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> data were split and that the tally would continue on later pages. Whether this
                    handwritten cross-referencing was done at the time of the 1850 census or later by someone who
                    figured out the problem is impossible to determine. It is logical to assume that when the 1853
                    state/township numbers arrived and were printed in the <hi rend="i">Compendium</hi>, a compiler
                    might have double-checked the original schedules, assembled the pieces of the puzzle, and entered
                    the cross-reference notation. But this is only an assumption, and by then it was too late for the

                    </placeName> census schedules from 1850 only partially explain the dramatic decline of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the national seventh census. A simple mistake in counting—or not

                    count. This jumbled compilation of names does not, however, account for the dramatic increase to
                    3,800 three years later according to the state/township survey. It could be that assistant marshals
                    Dalby and Park undercounted in 1850; after all, 2,600 represented only a small increase from 2,070
                    in 1840. Just possibly, Visher's allusions to Hoosiers moving west and Taylor's scenario about
                    disease and migrations are correct, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s growth had indeed slowed in the 1840s.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Another possibility is
                    that the estimate of 3,800 in 1853 was grossly inflated. Only one thing can be said with assurance:

                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

            <p>Although Sherman Minton has been the subject of a number of doctoral dissertations, rather
                    surprisingly this is the first published account of his public life. Born and raised in hardscrabble
                    poverty in southern Indiana, Minton early on developed a passion for politics and found a political
                    hero when he witnessed the campaigns of William Jennings Bryan. Minton received his law degree from
                    Indiana University and a master's degree in law from Yale. He served in the army during World War I.
                    After two unsuccessful efforts to run for Congress, Minton, a rabid New Deal supporter, emerged from
                    the rough-and-tumble of Hoosier politics with a Senate seat in 1934. Fortuitously, his desk in the
                    Senate was next to another freshman senator, Harry S. Truman.</p>
            <p>An ardent supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt's unpopular "court packing" plan and a
                    defender of the even less popular Burke-Wadsworth Selective Service Act of 1940, Minton was defeated
                    for reelection. Roosevelt appointed him to the Seventh Court of Appeals in 1941, and his friend,
                    Truman, named him to the Supreme Court in 1949. He retired from the latter position in 1956 because
                    of ill health. He died in 1965.</p>
            <p>This splendidly researched work is not simply a very well written account of Minton's career, it is
                    also a careful, if slightly repetitious, analysis of Minton's thinking, especially that which
                    underlay his judicial decisions. How an ardent New Deal liberal in the 1930s could emerge as a rock
                    solid believer in judicial restraint and a defender of governmental power at the expense of the
                    individual's civil rights by the 1950s without changing his populist sympathies is a fascinating
                    subject that the authors handle beautifully. At the same time, while their sympathy and admiration
                    for Minton are quite evident, their evaluations of his decisions are coolly objective.</p>
            <p>What the authors set themselves to do they have done very well, so perhaps one should not criticize
                    them for the book they did not intend to write. It does seem a shame, however, that given the
                    opportunity to produce a definitive biography of Minton, they limited themselves largely to his
                    public life. Readers learn that Minton had a wife and, almost as an aside in the last chapter, three
                    children and a number of grandchildren. They also learn that he became a Catholic because his
                    funeral was in a Catholic church. The reticence is all the <pb n="[51]" id="VAA4025-094-1-057"/>

            <p>For all that, this is a fine scholarly work that should be stimulating reading for anyone interested
                    in Indiana and national politics in the 1930s, Minton's work on the Court of Appeals, and most

            <p>This is the first time that I have reviewed a biography of a person whom I have met. Sister M.
                    Madeleva Wolff, C.S.C., president of St. Mary's College, Notre Dame (1934-1961), read poetry at a
                    student convocation at my college soon after her retirement. My president chose me among several
                    humanities faculty to join the two of them for lunch. As Sister Madeleva took her seat at the head
                    of the table, I peered into a face outlined by the fan-shaped wimple of her order and discovered a
                        <hi rend="i">grande dame.</hi> She exuded the intellectual gentility that characterized the
                    Christian cultural milieu for which St. Mary's was known.</p>
            <p>Sister Madeleva (1887-1964) stated two opinions I have not forgotten after nearly forty years. She
                    disliked coeducation (my college was Indiana's first Catholic college to admit men and women)
                    because women should have their own educational goals and not be evaluated by men's standards. Her
                    second opinion was that, since God is love (I John 4:18), divine justice is secondary; He would
                    abolish hell at the end of time.</p>
            <p>Gail Porter Mandell, humanistic studies professor at St. Mary's, presents the intimate story of the
                    spiritual and intellectual journey that took Sister Madeleva from her rural birthplace to study at
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>; from teaching before she finished her studies at St. Mary's to earning the first
                    doctorate awarded a nun at Berkeley; from joining the Sisters of the Holy Cross to spending a
                    sabbatical year at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in Europe; from heading a struggling <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="utu">Utah</region>
                    </placeName> college to founding the first graduate program in Catholic theology that admitted
                    sisters and laypersons; from letting students smoke on campus to recruiting the first black students
                    at St. Mary's; <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-094-1-059"/> from accepting the commands of narrow-minded
                    superiors to recommending that talented sisters undertake graduate study in reputable secular
                    institutions.</p>
            <p>A Catholic, religious, and female, Sister Madeleva nonetheless made lifelong friends out of her
                    Protestant, agnostic, and Jewish male professors at a large state university. She was a nun who
                    wrote poetry that seemed to make little distinction between sexual love and love of God. The
                    daughter of a Lutheran harness maker, her network of friends, acquaintances, and visitors included
                    Edith Whar-ton, G. K Chesterton, Frank Sheed, Jacques Maritain, William Butler Yeats, Mortimer
                    Adler, C. S. Lewis, Clare Booth Luce, Helen Hayes, and Conrad Hilton. She was a Republican, and her
                    role model was the medieval Abbess Hilda of Whitby. She was equally at home supervising the campus
                    gardener and conversing with John XXIII or John F. Kennedy.</p>
            <p>Sister Madeleva was expected to live by the rules and restrictions of the convent, but by publishing
                    over twenty books, including thirteen volumes of religious poetry and an autobiography, she became a
                    major Indiana author.</p>
            <p>Mandell has used the extensive materials preserved in St. Mary's and other archives, the
                    autobiography, and interviews with family, religious sisters, and friends. She has revealed Sister
                    Madeleva's life for all to see and has had the full cooperation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross to
                    accomplish her task. Mandell confirms my luncheon impression: here was an extraordinary, gifted
                    woman.</p>

                    Joseph M. White. Photographs by Kim Charles Ferrill. (Carmel: Guild Press of Indiana, 1996. Pp. xvi,
                    202. Illustrations, map, index. Paperbound, $19.95.)</head>
            <p>In 1976 Dr. Grover Hartman, executive director of the Indiana Council of Churches, introduced many
                    Hoosiers to the architectural riches of their state's religious sites with what became a yearly
                    series of automobile tours. Hartman was also instrumental in the founding of the Indiana Religious
                    History Association, which has now published a guide written in his honor. The book will delight
                    anyone interested in the religious history of the state. Joseph M. White provides a well-annotated
                    volume, divided by region and county, which covers hundreds of religiously significant sites across
                    Indiana. Churches, synagogues, mosques, monasteries, houses, and college buildings are among the
                    sites included. Each entry includes relevant dates (such as a congregation's founding dates and the
                    dates of previous and <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-094-1-060"/> present buildings), an identification of
                    architectural style, and street address or other specific location. Many entries are preceded by
                    codes, some of which indicate sites on the National Register of Historic Places or other
                    architectural and historical registers. White has also selected and coded a number of "Must
                    See" sites that possess "extraordinary architectural or historical
                    importance"; these notations are often more detailed than others. The book is generously
                    illustrated with an excellent series of photographs.</p>
            <p>The only quibble with such a volume is that it tempts the reader to hit the road with book in hand
                    but then proves to be a somewhat frustrating resource to use. The book, otherwise beautifully
                    produced, contains one slim index, and that only of each Indiana county. Readers looking for the
                    sites in a specific town, or looking for a specific site in they-know-not-what town (much less
                    county), will sometimes be hard-pressed to find the information they require. Some of the author's
                    "Must See" sites can be located in a front listing of the book's photographs, but
                    a separate index of all these sites would also have been nice. This criticism, however, arises more
                    from the quality of the book than from any lack thereof. With so many entries, and so many tempting
                    photographs, the dedicated student of religious history in Indiana will simply have to gather up a
                    state roadmap along with the book and mark destinations beforehand. My own next "Must
                    See" is the Art Deco style Tyson United Methodist Church in <placeName>

                    and lasting tribute to the work of Grover Hartman.</p>

                    Winquist. (Upland, Ind.: Taylor University Press, 1996. Pp. xvi, 345. Illustrations, notes.
                    Paperbound, $12.75.)</head>
            <p>The book, primarily an institutional history by two Taylor University faculty members, was published
                    by the university's press for its sesquicentennial celebration. A well-researched and engaging
                    narrative, it is a useful institutional history of Taylor University, a Methodist Episcopal
                    institution. It is also a contribution to Indiana's educational history, the history of higher
                    education, and women's history.</p>
            <p>The authors see two currents persistently flowing through Taylor University's legacy: (1) its liberal
                    arts emphasis, derived from an originally classical curriculum; (2) international missionary
                    service, stemming from Bishop William Taylor's interest in Africa. Their <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-094-1-061"/> examination of the university's unique identity and mission is
                    appropriate reading for the present time when many institutions, especially those that originated
                    under church auspices, are redefining their identities and renewing their missions.</p>
            <p>Focusing on women's education from 1846 to 1890, chapter one treats the origins of the Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> Female College, founded by the Methodist Episcopal church in 1846 as a women's liberal
                    arts college. The authors ably present the college's early history within a framework of
                    nineteenth-century events in Indiana and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. While remaining committed to women's education, the institution, renamed Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> College, became coeducational in 1855. Its curriculum remained heavily oriented to
                    classical languages and literature. In 1890 the institution, renamed Taylor University, began to
                    offer diversified programs consisting of the normal (teacher education), scientific, classical,
                    music, business, medical, and arts curricula. In 1891 Taylor University moved from Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> to Upland, Indiana. While always grounded in Methodism, the institution's evangelical
                    orientation and values were revived in the 1890s.</p>
            <p>Chapter two is a biography of Bishop Taylor, for whom the university is named. A vigorous Methodist
                    clergyman, Taylor initiated worldwide missionary activities but was especially concerned with
                    Africa. Developing the "Pauline strategy," Taylor believed that missions should be
                    economically self-sustaining. He energetically founded Methodist mission stations in
                            <placeName>
                  <country reg="sa">South Africa</country>, <country reg="lb">Liberia</country>,
                            <country reg="ao">Angola</country>
               </placeName>, and the Congo. Taylor's evangelical zeal was
                    a powerful influence on Taylor University's missionary ethos.</p>
            <p>Chapter three describes the university's student organizations and activities, particularly those
                    involving women. Publications such as the yearbook and newspaper are examined for their general
                    descriptions of student life as well as their references to women's issues. Women's participation in
                    campus literary and debating societies not only afforded public-speaking experience but was also a
                    way to discuss issues such as temperance and suffrage. Still other student organizations, reflecting
                    the institution's Methodism, encouraged religious observance and commitment.</p>
            <p>Chapter three also provides an excellent history of Taylor University's organization, curriculum, and
                    faculty. Noting university reorganization into academically specialized divisions and departments,
                    the authors clearly ascribe the movement to greater profes-sionalization. A very interesting section
                    describes the contributions, accompanied by biographical sketches, of key women faculty members. The
                    narrative fairly examines academic conflicts and disappointments as well as achievements.</p>
            <p>Chapters four, five, and six, entitled "To The Corners of the Earth," return to
                    Taylor University's role in preparing missionaries for international assignments, particularly in
                    Africa and Asia. Though <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-094-1-062"/> this section of the book consists
                    primarily of an interesting series of biographies, the authors' theoretical appraisal portrays
                    missionary efforts as paternalist, transitional, or modern. Several biographical sketches are of
                    such noteworthy individuals as Bishop Ralph Dodge, who served in Rhodesia as that country moved
                    toward its independence as Zimbabwe. Although the authors are generally laudatory, they point out
                    conflicts and tensions relating to Methodist missionary endeavors.</p>
            <p>Nicely illustrated, the book provides a biographical listing of significant Methodist missionaries
                    prior to 1945. It is well documented with useful endnote citations; unfortunately, it lacks an
                    index.</p>

                    Critchlow. (<placeName>

                    bibliography, index. $39.95.)</head>
            <p>Historian Donald T. Critchlow fits the Studebaker story into the larger study of business history in
                    America. He argues that "tradition—as construed by management—played
                    a fundamental role in molding corporate culture, rhetoric, and strategy at Studebaker" (p.
                    7).</p>
            <p>Studebaker was founded as a wagon company in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1852 by the Studebaker brothers, who were sons of German Dunkard parents.
                    These five brothers had a strong sense of piety and noblesse oblige. They opposed unions but
                    "viewed themselves as Christian businessmen who espoused harmony between the social orders
                    through community obligation and social responsibility" (p. 8). They paid the highest wages
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and built their company into the largest wagonmaker in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, employing five hundred men and grossing over $1 million by 1875.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, the Studebakers sometimes wanted an active role for government in American society.
                    During the Panic of 1893, for example, Clement Studebaker urged Congress to start a public works
                    program to halt unemployment. Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist party leader, said, "If all
                    employers of labor were like Peter Studebaker, there would be no strikes. He is a true friend of
                    workingmen" (p. 29).</p>
            <p>The transition from wagons and carriages to cars was a tough one for the Studebakers. William C.
                    Durant, the founder of General Motors, made the switch from carriages to cars in his own business
                    life, but the Studebakers needed help from an in-law, Frederick Fish. The Studebakers, who were
                    committed to the old wagon technology, eased their way out of active involvement with the company
                    and let <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-094-1-063"/> Fish and a new management team compete with Durant and
                    Henry Ford.</p>
            <p>The Studebaker traditions were not forgotten. Albert R. Ersk-ine, who ran the company in the 1920s,
                    invoked the Studebaker name as a symbol and as a memory of good will and good labor relations. The
                    Great Depression devastated Studebaker, and the company went into receivership; when Paul G. Hoffman
                    and Harold Vance took over and made Studebaker profitable again, they used the company tradition of
                    good employer-employee relations to deal effectively with the automobile unions.</p>
            <p>Studebaker, as Critchlow shows, flourished during World War II but fell into decline in the 1950s.
                    The company failed to modernize and lost its market share to the Big Three—Ford, General
                    Motors, and Chrysler. Studebaker merged with Packard in 1954, but this only delayed the inevitable.
                    The company shut down in 1963, one of the last of the independent automakers.</p>
            <p>Critchlow's book is a useful history of an important American company. The history of Studebaker
                    provides a useful look at why it is so hard for successful entrepreneurs to perpetuate their success
                    from generation to generation and new technology to newer technology.</p>

            <p>The proliferation of research on early <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> during the past two decades has prompted several scholarly reassessments of the role of
                    the state in the development of the Old Northwest and the trans-Appalachian frontier generally.
                    These works have explored such issues as cultural interchanges, the contest for empire,
                    republicanism, and the market economy. While touching on similar themes, <hi rend="i">The <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        </placeName> Frontier</hi> occupies a slightly different niche in this genre. It is intended to
                    be a popular account and is based almost entirely on recent secondary works. It thus does not
                    include footnotes, but readers can find the references in an excellent and comprehensive
                    bibliographical essay.</p>
            <p>The first five chapters grapple with the relations among the native inhabitants of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country, the French, the British, and the Americans before 1795. Hurt sees the
                    well-known episodes of the early frontier as a series of complex accommodations among natives and
                    Europeans in their mutual struggle for control. It is gratifying to find this more recent
                    interpretation in a popular account, but some <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-094-1-064"/> readers may still
                    be left with the uncomfortable impression that all that mattered in the end was Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s triumph at Fallen Timbers and the 1795 Treaty of Greenville that opened much of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to American settlement.</p>
            <p>The American occupation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> is covered in the next five chapters, which include accounts of surveying, the founding
                    of selected towns, farm practices and products, merchant trade, and religion, all based closely on
                    familiar recent scholarship. The separate sections are generally interesting and lively, but
                    analysis that might forge useful links and integrate them into a single smoothly flowing narrative
                    is missing. More importantly, gaps and omissions sometimes actually distort the early history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and make it difficult to understand underlying issues.</p>
            <p>Chapter ten on the religious frontier is a case in point. The author includes a general discussion of
                    the Methodists but covers Presbyterians only from the study of a single town. He pays considerably
                    more attention to the numerically smaller Shakers, Quakers, and Separatists at Zoar. Two of the most
                    important denominations— the Congregationalists and the Baptists—are hardly
                    mentioned. These omissions and the failure to explore the implications of denominational friction
                    are unfortunate because religion provides an important context for understanding migration to the
                    frontier, settlement patterns, social and cultural relationships, and political divisions.</p>
            <p>The final three chapters return to the struggles between the native inhabitants and the Americans
                    during the War of 1812, contain more material on market-oriented farming, and finally discuss the
                    emergence of manufacturing and the canal movement. Tiny sections on women, foreign settlers, and
                    persons of African descent are insufficient, even given the relatively small amount of scholarship
                    on these subjects. Hurt ends his account abruptly and without any attempt to draw conclusions about
                    the <placeName>

                    in 1994. There were a number of topics to which, as he remarks in his preface, he had previously
                    "given short shrift." Now there is more attention to "soldier
                    voting-in-the-field, legal and constitutional aspects of the war, the military campaigns of
                    1864-1865, and the story of <placeName>

                    the jacket that there is "a brief history of each of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s fifty-three infantry regiments." Several are not mentioned at all, and many
                    of the "histories" are little more than brief references.</p>

                    mention in Element's earlier work. Here the author makes good the omission with respectful attention
                    to the participation of the state's few blacks in the war effort—"irony and
                    more," as Klement comments (p. 93), in view of their exclusion from citizenship. Apart from
                    the supplementary material, the text of this edition is not significantly different from previous
                    versions. The appearance, however, is strikingly improved. The page is enlarged and set in double
                    columns, chapters are numbered, and there are over one hundred well-chosen and aptly placed
                    illustrations of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s soldiers and their leaders.</p>
            <p>As the author remarks, however, the work "still lacks footnotes" (p. v). In their
                    absence it is difficult to determine the source or accuracy of a particular quotation or statement.
                    Passages drawn from Frank A. Haskell's <hi rend="i">The Battle of <placeName>

               </hi> (pp. 54-55) contain a number of faulty readings, and one surmises that there
                    may be other similar inaccuracies. For example, the Seventeenth Corps was not present at the Battle
                    of the Crater as Klement states (p. 95). More rigorous editing would have dealt with numerous
                    repetitions; for example, Ulysses S. Grant's dismissal of Robert C. Murphy, colonel of the 8th <placeName>

            <p>The story of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s industrial, urban, and working-class development in the early twentieth century is
                    not new. Historians have produced a plethora of books and articles examining the working-class city.
                    Most studies, however, have relied on traditional sources such as company records, letters, and
                    diaries, which have not always painted a very vivid picture of everyday working-class life.</p>
            <p>In an effort to document the lives of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s working class more fully, Kevin Boyle and Victoria Getis have turned to a
                    nontra-ditional source, photographs. In <hi rend="i">Muddy Boots and Ragged Aprons</hi> they have
                    successfully integrated nearly ninety previously unpublished photographs and thought-provoking
                    commentary to paint a broad picture of working-class life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the first three decades of the twentieth century. The photographs are drawn from a
                    variety of archives, including the Ford Industrial Archives, the Ford Historical Museum at <placeName>

            <p>Organized in three sections—Home, Work, and Community— this volume shows the
                    importance of using photographs to document the everyday life of ordinary workers. Ranging from the
                    interior of a working-class bar, to a group of women in the decorating department of the
                    Jeffery-Dewitt Sparkplug factory, to a crowded and unhealthy bedroom, to a social gathering of the
                    Bethel AME Church, the photographs provide important lessons for labor historians and nonacademics
                    alike.</p>
            <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-094-1-067"/>
            <p>Most strikingly revealed by the photographs is the difference in the standard of living between the
                    middle class, illustrated by Charles Hargraves (p. 40) and Margaret Cummer (p. 44), and the working
                    class, represented by Abdul Amondi and Dom Poccia (p. 52) who labored in the Ford automobile
                    factory. In the Hargraves and Cummer households the photographs include porcelain sinks, bathtubs,

            <p>Did he or didn't he? As far as the American public is concerned, it seems, the verdict is already in:
                    Thomas Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings's children. But Annette Gordon-Reed is not quite so
                    ready to decide. There are, she says, days she wakes up knowing that Jefferson fathered Sally
                    Hemings's children and other days when she is less sure. It might be argued that this is the
                    historian's fate. In the absence of a smoking gun (or in this case a DNA test), one can never be
                    certain. Still, Gordon-Reed's reexamination of the evidence will convince many readers that they can
                    be as sure about the reality of the Hemings-Jefferson relationship as they are about any number of
                    other things.</p>
            <p>Long dismissed by mainstream historians as a politically inspired calumny or an instance of what
                    Freud called the family romance, the story of a relationship between the third president and a slave
                    (who may or may not have been his late wife's half sister) gained new currency when revived in Fawn
                    Brodie's 1974 biography, <hi rend="i">Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History.</hi> But Brodie's
                    claims, based in part on dubious psychologizing and a tendency to overread the Jeffersonian texts,
                        <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-094-1-068"/> persuaded few in the historical profession. If nothing else,
                    her picture of a passionate long-term relationship seemed remarkably romanticized and blithely
                    ignored the obvious point, that relations between a master and his slave were based on fundamental
                    inequalities of power.</p>
            <p>Gordon-Reed, a law professor, comes at the problem in a different and far more satisfying way. Why,
                    she asks, have historians been so willing to accept the traditions passed down in Jefferson's family
                    (laying the blame at the feet of one or the other of Jefferson's nephews, Peter and Samuel Carr) and
                    so dismissive of the traditions passed down by Sally Hemings's children? Who, she asks, has more to
                    gain in this situation? Her critique of the standards historians have used in weighing these
                    conflicting claims is devastating.</p>
            <p>Gordon-Reed's other trump cards are the remarkable set of circumstances surrounding the births of
                    Sally Hemings's children and the fate of the Hemings family generally. Each of Hemings's children
                    was conceived shortly after Jefferson returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName> from an extended absence. Of the hundreds of slaves Jefferson owned, only Hemingses
                    were freed during his lifetime or by his will. Does this <hi rend="i">prove</hi> that Jefferson
                    fathered Sally Hemings's children? No, not if one demands absolute proof. But it most certainly
                    raises questions and shifts the burden of explanation to those who deny Jefferson's paternity.
                    Further, it makes it far more difficult for Jefferson's "defenders" to rely on the
                    often profferred argument that it would have been "out of character" for Jefferson
                    to have had an affair with Sally Hemings. (Not all of those who deny Jefferson's paternity, of
                    course, see themselves as "defending" him.)</p>
            <p>In short, this is an important work, with things to say not only about its formal subject but about
                    the practices of historians as well. Students of Jefferson will ignore it at their peril; students
                    of American race relations will find it compelling.</p>

            <p>Among the long-range projects of gathering and editing the papers of prominent Americans, this volume
                    on the role of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall is an outstanding publication. Herbert A.
                    Johnson brings to the task long experience with the subject. Among his other contributions are the
                    ongoing edition of Marshall's papers and an authored volume, <hi rend="i">Foundations of Power</hi>
                    (1981), <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-094-1-069"/> in a set with George Lee Haskins concerning the years
                    1801-1815, the first half of the chief justice's tenure.</p>
            <p>An expert in both law and history, Johnson offers a scholarly, heavily documented description and
                    analysis of his topic. There is also much source material, which many predecessors have sought with
                    limited success. This volume is one in a series on chief justices and will help specialists and
                    generalists understand the impact of the judiciary upon government, indeed on society, during the
                    early national era.</p>
            <p>One of the most valuable parts of the volume is an extensive quantitative presentation of the work of
                    the federal circuit courts on which Marshall and other Supreme Court members, as well as district
                    judges, sat. Johnson classifies archival information by the nature of cases as well as by justices
                    hearing them. He shows the branches of law—constitutional, admiralty, criminal,
                    contracts, real property—in decisions and in positions of each Supreme Court member in
                    each circuit and at <placeName>

            <p>Two samples of the author's handling of the background and hearing of many cases can be mentioned.
                    Johnson does not see <hi rend="i">Mar-bury</hi> v. <hi rend="i">

                    quarters. He may be correct, but he is qualifying historical judgments that show the case's large
                    political significance. Johnson is certainly aware of political and economic factors in legal
                    developments. Still, he may not give enough weight to these dynamics. Another example is <hi rend="i">Green</hi> v. <hi rend="i">Biddle</hi> (1824), the land dispute between <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    </placeName>, which Johnson presents informatively. He discusses the controversy over the court's
                    holding that the constitutional contract clause binds a state as a party to an agreement, but he
                    thinks the court could have invalidated the <placeName>

                    </placeName> claimant law because it violated the laws of nature. Despite the blending of natural
                    and positive law at the bar and bench in those days, one cannot find any clause in the Constitution
                    empowering judicial review on that open ground.</p>

                    crafted work that will broaden and deepen readers' understanding of America's frenzied experience

            <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-094-1-070"/>
            <p>In nineteen elegantly titled chapters—such as "Lost Love, Lost
                    Families"—Rohrbough argues persuasively that the discovery of gold along the
                    American River not only transformed <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and the West generally, it also reshaped the nation as a whole. In so doing, Rohrbough
                    uses the West as a basis for examining issues that touched Americans in every part of the country.
                    He thus achieves regional historians' most desired goal: the illumination of a local subject within
                    its national context, thereby expanding the intellectual boundaries of each.</p>
            <p>Culling diaries, letters, and memoirs found in repositories from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>

                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, Rohrbough looks at both the new communities of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and the older ones of the East. What emerges is a rich portrait of Americans,
                    individually and in groups, struggling to cope with social, economic, and political upheaval. The
                    scope of Rohrbough's research affirms his point—the effects of the Gold Rush permeated
                    all corners of the country and left indelible marks on the national experience.</p>
            <p>Rohrbough eschews the perception of the Gold Rush as a glorious example of regional conquest brought
                    about by a lusty group of robust male adventurers. Rather, he looks inside the American family to
                    delineate the painful processes of personal and public decision making that brought so many
                    irreversible changes to the patterns of national life. He paints a compelling picture of the
                    hardships, pleasures, and benefits for those who departed for the gold fields as well as the
                    endeavors, sorrows, and rewards of those who maintained the home.</p>
            <p>Above all, Rohrbough pushes back the male-centered definitions of mining and places
                    women—regardless of their geographic location—at the very core of Gold Rush
                    history. This is a groundbreaking departure from the usual conventions of mining history, which more
                    or less relegates women to the saloons and brothels that dotted the landscape of every boomtown in
                    the West. In contrast, <hi rend="i">Days of Gold</hi> depicts men and women responding in concert to
                    the forces unleashed by the events at Sutter's Mill. This book offers the gender-bonded history so
                    often sought and so seldom produced.</p>
            <p>Rohrbough convincingly shows that this era, its glamour and adventure aside, changed America and its
                    people in complex and permanent ways. Roles for men and women, by the hearth and on the boulevard,
                    altered, as did Americans' cultural perceptions, political vision, and economic experiences.
                    Impressive in research, graceful in design, sound in argument, insightful in interpretation,
                    admirable in presentation, <hi rend="i">Days of Gold</hi> is a significant contribution to the field
                    of mining history and a scholarly standard for all western historians to emulate.</p>

            <p>Readers seeking a straightforward synthesis of the exploding historical literature on North American
                    frontiers will find exactly what they are looking for in this book. Gregory H. Nobles seems to have
                    familiarized himself with virtually everything that scholars have written on the subject. Only two
                    decades ago many historians considered frontier studies essentially dead. It was a field dominated
                    by the legacy of Frederick Jackson Turner, the scholar who posited in an 1893 speech that the impact
                    of settling and resettling supposedly empty lands had made the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> into an exceptional nation. Turner's adherents published a pile of scholarly monographs
                    that attempted to demonstrate the validity of his interpretation everywhere from colonial New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>
                    </placeName>. Subsequent critics attacked Turner and his followers, pointing to evidence that
                    undermined their sometimes unsubtle equation of the frontier with democracy, equality, and
                    individualism. By the 1970s the argument had become stale. What more was there to be said on the
                    subject?</p>
            <p>Plenty, as Nobles's book makes clear. A generation of scholars has revitalized the field by thinking
                    of frontier studies in terms of multicultural encounters. They have emphasized the roles of women,
                    Indians, Hispanics, Africans, and others in both carrying out and resisting the expansion of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Above all, they have argued that frontier history must be understood as a story of
                    often savage and duplicitous conquest rather than benign settlement.</p>
            <p>Nobles discusses these historiographical debates in an effective introduction. He then writes a
                    narrative of frontier encounters that begins with the initial arrival of English-speaking peoples in
                    eastern North America in the early 1600s and ends with the official closing of the frontier in 1890.
                    The chapters are lively and efficient presentations of the evidence and interpretations in the
                    recent literature. Nobles strives for balance both in content and tone; there is no dichotomy
                    between good and bad guys. <hi rend="i">American Frontiers</hi> is not a polemic. Instead of
                    attacking other historians, Nobles concentrates on constructing a reliable and readable story.
                    Judged on these terms, his book is a success.</p>
            <p>For all the sound and fury of revisionism, however, Nobles's book is surprisingly similar in its
                    overall contours to the frontier syntheses written decades ago by historians such as Frederick Merk
                    and Ray Allen Billington. He is more critical of American policies; he takes Indians seriously, not
                    just as people in the way of American expansion; and he devotes considerable attention to such
                    relatively new subjects as African Americans and environmentalism. Still, <hi rend="i">American
                        Frontiers</hi> tells a very familiar tale: how, for good or ill, English-speaking peoples in the
                    course of a couple of centuries occupied <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-094-1-072"/> and transformed most of
                    the North American continent into one of the most dynamic and powerful nations in the history of the
                    world. In its basic outline this narrative has a power far beyond our ability to bend it to our
                    purposes, no matter how much we argue about what we ought to call it.</p>

            <p>The Middle West has the well-deserved reputation of being distinctly "American."
                    This designation covers a range of distinctions, of which not-being-like-Europe is critical. But how
                    could it be that the region is so different from Europe when so many of its people came from Europe,
                    and not so very long ago? For Jon Gjerde the answer lies in a convergence of attitudes and values.
                    The pioneer settlers were joined after the 1840s by millions of immigrants from Europe. Gjerde is
                    especially concerned with the largest and least studied group, the Germans, and their interaction
                    with the Yankees. The book, although it touches upon many midwestern points, is centered in a
                    one-hundred-mile radius around <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Dubuque</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
               </placeName>, which itself was the epicenter of
                    Germania.</p>
            <p>Gjerde ranges widely over social, political, and intellectual themes, with much on farming, religion,
                    marriages, and children, and with some attention to education and occupation. Migration is a major
                    theme, as he demonstrates how communities reassembled themselves in the New World. Would they
                    isolate themselves and echo the old country (as the French did in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>), or would they interact with and learn from other groups, change and Americanize
                    themselves? Would America be balkanized with groups hating and killing each other? (Gjerde does
                    chronicle the intergroup violence, but there was not very much.) The Germans had a strong tendency
                    to become farmers. Indeed, they tended to stay in agriculture long after other groups moved on to
                    the towns and cities, so the chapters on rural life are especially revealing. The Germans were
                    strikingly religious, although the Lutheran half warred with the Catholic half whenever it was not
                    battling heretical Lutherans or dangerous secularists. The Scandinavians are well represented, and
                    Gjerde contrasts their lifestyle and Lutheranism with that of the Germans. He is effective in
                    showing how the immigrants built their own uniquely American churches and used them as a base to
                    establish family roles and moral <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-094-1-073"/> standards. He also shows how
                    the immigrants succumbed to the lure of American individualism.</p>
            <p>The Germans brought with them strong family and community ties and built strong churches here
                    (especially the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Synod and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Synod Lutherans). Yet they were practical people who took advantage of their financial
                    opportunities and thereby became more individualistic and less beholden to their ministers, elders,
                    and community notables. The Yankees took the lead in aggressive modernization, trying, as promoters
                    of temperance, antislavery, education, and corporations, to convert everyone to their social,
                    economic, political, and ethical viewpoint. But the Yankees were too frenzied, too obtrusive, too
                    immoderate for the Germans, and conflict repeatedly erupted in politics, especially regarding the
                    prohibition issue. Simply put, the Yankees (in alliance with the Scandinavians) attempted to dry up
                    the Midwest and put German beer out of business.</p>
            <p>Gjerde's text moves gracefully among many different types of evidence and styles of writing. The book
                    is full of tables, but also of revealing pithy quotes from newspapers (especially <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dubuque</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s foreign language press), and from diaries, letters, and memoirs as well. Political
                    historians will appreciate the author's fine coverage of the eth-nocultural theme in politics,
                    especially the raging debates over liquor, schooling, and women's rights. The outcome is not
                    told—Gjerde touches too lightly on the decisive years of World War I. He or another
                    equally talented historian needs to bring the story up to date to show how the descendants of
                    Germans and Swedes, Yankees and southerners, have become indistinguishable individualists today,
                    each learning from and teaching the others, each forgetting their cultural heritage.</p>

            <p>In each of our respective pasts, there exists some form of Main Street—a place that evokes
                    recollections of the corner drugstore, memories of simpler times, or images of a vibrant and
                    bustling community. Whether it exists in the quaint countryside of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the farming communities of the American heartland, towns of the Southwest, or simply
                    as a part of our collective memory, Main Street has been visible in our history, culture, and built
                    environment since the beginning of American settlement. Fascinated by its central role in our lives,
                    Richard V. Francaviglia has spent decades gathering images from small towns across the American
                    landscape and studying the evolution of this corridor as both physical space and cultural <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-094-1-074"/> phenomenon. This highly readable and intriguing volume brings together
                    his observations about how time, space, and popular images merged to create a place that has become
                    the symbol of small-town America and, in many ways, America as a whole.</p>
            <p>Relying upon historic and contemporary photographs, town plans, maps, and fieldwork, Francaviglia
                    explores the diverse regional patterns of America's small towns in order to understand the emergence
                    and meaning of communities. Since his primary interest as a historical geographer is in the way
                    people utilized both time and space to create place, the author "reads" his towns
                    and their histories through their material culture—the buildings, physical designs, and
                    public spaces. He argues, for example, that the transition in architectural styles along Main
                    Street—from residential to assorted commercial forms and the incorporation of catalog
                    storefronts, plate glass, and stylized architecture—gave each streetscape a distinct
                    personality and revealed how the town perceived itself and wished others to see it at different
                    points in time. Likewise, the author's analysis of street plans, shapes of property parcels, and the
                    presence of public spaces (parks, courthouse squares) uncovers distinct regional characteristics
                    that reveal how people viewed and used their townscapes.</p>
            <p>While most of the book deals with concrete issues of town development, the last chapter focuses on
                    the popular image of Main Street. Here, Francaviglia explores how Main Street became a part of our
                    collective consciousness and how it ultimately came to represent a sense of traditional American
                    values and community. In doing so, he describes how Walt Disney incorporated a fictive Main Street
                    as the core of his theme parks (a practice replicated by other amusement centers) in order to evoke
                    memories (and myths) of past times and values. The author argues convincingly that Main Street,
                    especially as reinterpreted by Disney, has been a major influence in the development of modern-day
                    downtown commercial centers and suburban shopping malls.</p>
            <p>His major contribution to the examination of small towns is a list of sixteen axioms or
                    generalizations. These accurately describe how Main Streets have grown since colonial times and are
                    certainly useful for any local history practitioner or observer. Of special interest to Hoosier
                    readers is the credit given to the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana for a composite graphic
                    illustrating the evolution of architectural styles in America's towns, an item to which the author
                    refers regularly to support his themes.</p>
            <p>Francaviglia uses Main Street as a medium by which to study the past, present, and future of
                    small-town America. In so doing, he takes his readers on an enjoyable and illuminating walk down
                    Main Street USA. From this excursion readers will assuredly become more cognizant of their
                    surrounding environs, more inquiring about how their communities developed, and, one hopes, more
                    interested in the <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-094-1-075"/> meaning of small towns amidst the urban and
                    suburban growth of contemporary America.</p>

            <p>The motel is a quintessentially American institution and one that is central to the American cultural
                    experience. Yet its history, like the history of roads and of motor transport, has been slighted.
                    This neglect stems in part from problems in locating sources about a mode of mobility that is
                    primarily individualistic and a service infrastructure that has not retained a coherent body of
                    archival records. It also results from the magnitude and diversity of the subject of land
                    transportation. Where do academics begin when assessing motor mobility generally and roadside
                    lodgings in particular? A study of motels, defined as roadside accommodations, involves not only the
                    sweep of twentieth-century history but also landscape geography, architecture, planning, business
                    management, changing patterns of consumerism, and cultural interactions. It is thus fitting that
                    this interdisciplinary topic should be discussed by two geographers and a historian. Readers may
                    have to use the index to gain the specific information that they require, but they will be
                    effectively informed and greatly entertained.</p>
            <p>The authors explore the place of the motel in American society, examining its origins, evolution, and
                    geographical distribution and its changing social and cultural contexts. The book proceeds
                    chronologically, although this chronology is interspersed with thematic chapters examining motel
                    architecture, motels in Albuquerque, and two chains, the early <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alamo</settlement>
                    </placeName> Plaza Hotel Courts and Holiday Inns. Motels began with rental cabins and cabin courts
                    in the first three decades of the century. By the 1930s they had become easier to recognize and
                    document. Roadside accommodations increased rapidly in the 1930s and then again in the two decades
                    after World War II. They peaked at 61,000 units in 1961, after which they declined in number but not
                    in rooms available for hire. By 1994 there were 3.1 million rooms available in hotels and motels.</p>
            <p>Motels also changed markedly in style. Even in the early 1960s most were independent operations. The
                    individualistic "mom and pop" enterprises were, however, fading in the face of
                    referral chains of cooperating motels, motel trade associations, and ownership chains. <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-094-1-076"/> The next quarter century witnessed the growth of branded motel
                    franchising. By 1987 64 percent of the country's units were part of a lodgings network, with the top
                    five chains providing nearly 30 percent of the rooms for hire. To attract investment and to convince
                    the nation's travelers of motel utility and respectability, owners had developed
                    "place-product-packaging." This type of chain was owned by a single person or
                    corporate entity, and all branches had the same name, the same architecture, and the same interior
                    room decor and offered the same range of services. Travelers then knew what to expect. For those
                    customers who wanted a differentiated service, moteliers developed a range of budget-luxury lodging
                    brands. By this time motels had become trend setters for modern living. Introducing many clients to
                    such novel commodities as color television, coffee makers, and residential swimming pools, they
                    molded American culture as well as being shaped by it. Much remains to be ascertained about the
                    motel as an essential part of American society, but the authors have provided both a remarkable
                    start and an agenda for future inquiry.</p>

                        <p>At hand is a short memoir by George Cary Eggleston describing his experiences as a
                                    teacher on Riker's Ridge (also spelled Ryk-er's Ridge) in <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, northeast of <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, which his brother Edward Eggleston re-used in his novel <hi rend="i">The Hoosier Schoolmaster.</hi> This incident interests me.</p>
                        <p>Charley Grebe, aged 21 and the strongest boy in the School, made a deal with the new
                                    young schoolmaster—age 16!—that he would keep order in the
                                    school if the master would truly teach him math, "instead of just
                                    pretending, like the rest." It was his ambition to become a shipwright, for
                                    which he needed to know "arithmetic, algebra, and at least the rudiments of
                                    trigonometry."</p>
                        <p>The agreement was mutually satisfactory. Eggleston did teach him; he became an
                                    apprentice, and discipline was exemplary. Eggleston did not know whether he achieved
                                    his goal and did indeed become a shipwright.</p>
                        <p>Does any reader know his later history?</p>

                    from 1993 through 1997 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's history. The list
                    will normally appear in each March issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> Since
                    no list of this kind can ever be exhaustive, we hope that readers will help us by sending items for
                    possible future inclusion. We are especially interested in listing publications that contribute to
                    the understanding of Indiana's past but that are not usually reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will
                    not list newspaper articles or accounts of local historical society activities, but printed
                    pamphlets as well as journal articles may be listed. All such items for the March, 1999, issue must
                    be received by November 1, 1998. Many people have contributed to the present list, but major
                    responsibility has rested with Leigh Darbee of the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
