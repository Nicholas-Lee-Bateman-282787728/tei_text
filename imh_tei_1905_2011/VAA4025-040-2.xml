            <head>The Death of Nancy Hanks Lincoln</head>
            <byline>PHILIP D. JORDAN</byline>
            <p>Inside the cabin there was sickness. For almost a week the woman had ailed until now she no longer
                    could struggle to a position from which she might glimpse the autumn foliage which was touching
                    Pigeon Creek with color. As Nancy Hanks Lincoln saw the rude log house, unfinished for more than a
                    year, she may have felt that Indiana in 1818 was not quite the promised land to which she had so
                    readily agreed to go. Her bedstead, a crude affair of poles stuck between the logs in a corner of
                    the cabin, sagged when she shifted so that she might see the heavy log-hewn table, the three-legged
                    stools, the iron pot and spider, and the tin and pewter dishes. Sifting into the loft through
                    unchinked logs, the October wind shuffled the leaves upon which her son, Abe, slept. Then the
                    weakness and dizziness came again.</p>
            <p>The settlers of Pigeon Creek knew what that meant. Thomas Lincoln had coffined Betsy and Thomas
                    Sparrow and only about a week earlier had helped bury Peter Brooner's wife whose home was
                    half a mile away. The mysterious milksickness, known in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> since colonial days, was following the frontier, stalking the pioneer as stealthily as
                    the hunter tracked the deer. It attacked milch cows as well as men and was called by many names.
                    Some knew it as the "trembles," the "staggers," the "tires" or "slows,"
                    and the "bloody murrain." Others spoke of it as "swamp sickness," "puking
                    fever," or "river sickness." Most frontiersmen, however, simply referred to it as
                    the "milk sick." And they were afraid of it, because, even though they had seen a few
                    milksick patients recover, they had watched many more die.</p>
            <p>What caused the disease no man knew. No remedies <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-040-2-004"/> prevailed
                    against it. Even the pioneer physician had nothing in his saddlebags that could halt the persistent
                    course of the disease. Neither the lancet nor the leech did anything but exhaust the patient. Heroic
                    doses of lobelia and herb infusions were only professional gestures. Within a period ranging from
                    two to nine days, most milksick victims lay decently on a cooling board. Yet, if no one understood
                    the cause of the disease, many were acquainted with its characteristic symptoms. Nancy Hanks Lincoln
                    must have manifested them all.</p>
            <p>No doubt she was wearied from her nursing care of the Sparrows and of Mrs. Brooner, so that she paid
                    little attention to the lassitude which forced her to rest as she went about her home chores.
                    Perhaps she gave little heed to increasing spells of dizziness and attributed her loss of appetite
                    to overexertion and fatigue. But she must have realized, when the nausea and persistent vomiting
                    came on, that the milksickness had struck. When Thomas Lincoln saw her with pain in the region of
                    the stomach and heard her, in her great thirst, ask for water, he, too, must have guessed the truth.
                    In all likelihood, he was prepared for the death of his thirty-five-year-old wife before she had
                    been ill many hours.</p>
            <p>No doubt the Lincolns and other settlers in the vicinity of Pigeon Creek wondered and talked about
                    the cause of this puking fever which, quiet as the forest shadows, was making the back-of-beyond a
                    place of death. Perhaps they advanced explanations and theories as other men were to do for more
                    than a hundred years before they finally solved the mystery of an endemic frontier disease which for
                    decades weakened the pioneer, took its toll of life, and baffled the medical profession. It made
                    dreadful ravages among early settlers, often causing them to break up communities and seek healthier
                    locations. Indeed, if John Hanks can be believed, it may have been among the reasons which prompted
                    Thomas Lincoln and his new wife, Sarah, to leave Indiana for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country. Hanks wrote: "The Reson is this we war perplext By a Disese cald Milk
                    Sick my Self Being the oldest I was Determed to Leve and hunt a Cuntry whare the milk was
                    notâ€¦"</p>
            <p>It was not going to be easy, however, to find a safe location in the Old Northwest. Thomas Ashe, as
                    early as 1806, appears to have identified the milksickness among the settlers <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-040-2-005"/> on the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>; and three years later, Thomas
                    Barbee, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> physician traveling through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, discovered the disease in the Mad River district. In 1810 and again in 1815, Daniel
                    Drake, most competent physician in the western country, published the first definite reports on the
                    "sickstomach." <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It has been ascribed to some noxious impregnation of the water; to the use, by the animals
                            whose milk and flesh are eaten, of some deleterious plant, and to marsh exhalation-the last
                            of which is the most plausible.</p>
                    </quote> Drake, intrigued by the unique nature of this disease which was causing so much
                    consternation among emigrants and settlers, began to study milksickness with a determination to
                    discover its cause, pathology, and treatment. For the next twenty years, articles appeared in the
                    distinguished medical journals of the western country. Editors of periodicals such as the <hi rend="i">Transylvania Journal of Medicine and Science,</hi> the <hi rend="i">Western Journal of
                        Medicine and Surgery,</hi> and the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                        </placeName> Journal of Medicine and Surgery</hi> were only too glad to open their columns to
                    information which might assist the pioneer doctor in treating the scores of frontiersmen who were
                    succumbing to the murrain.</p>
            <p>Travelers, hunters, and settlers, penetrating the forest wilderness, all too frequently came upon
                    evidences of milk fever in backwoods communities, on river boats, and in newly turned graves.
                    William Faux talked with a farmer near old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> who spoke bitterly of the "trembles"; Major Stephen H. Long found it along the
                        <geogName>Missouri River</geogName>; and Edmund Flagg spoke of it as prevailing in certain
                    isolated districts of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> where, he said, whole villages were depopulated so that it created a perfect panic
                    among the settlers. Physicians in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> described the disease in <hi rend="i">The Western Lancet,</hi> and the legislature of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> appointed a committee in 1827 to investigate the milksickness problem. In Indiana, the
                    state medical society attempted the same work. John Mason Peck, author of one of the most
                    enthusiastic guides to the West, despaired when he wrote of the milk fever and admitted sadly that
                    "physicians and others who have tried to determine its cause have had no success."</p>
            <p>During succeeding decades both the volume of literature and the confusion increased. Reuben G.
                    Thwaites, for example, wrote in 1906 that milksickness was "no longer so <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-040-2-006"/> diagnosed by medical authorities"; although even while he was penning
                    those words, new outbreaks of the disease were occurring in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>, and physicians and laboratory researchers were still talking of milksickness. Sir
                    William Osler's <hi rend="i">Principles and Practice of Medicine,</hi> the most widely
                    consulted text of the day, still retained the old name, milksickness. To illustrate further the
                    degree of misinformation concerning milksickness which even today creeps into literature, one has
                    only to read the passages describing the disease in Bruce <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s novel of the Lincoln country, <hi rend="i">For Us, the Living.</hi> And
                    within the past six months, Mr. Lancaster, in the pages of <hi rend="i">The Abraham Lincoln
                        Quarterly,</hi> has asked the same questions which the Lincolns of Pigeon Creek and scores of
                    other settlers put to one another in their bewilderment. "Has this strange visitation ever been
                    explained?" wrote <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName>. "Has it ever cropped out in other parts of the country?"</p>
            <p>The answer to both queries is in the affirmative. The cause of milksickness was almost found by a
                    score of pioneer observers and scientists. Drake, it will be remembered, mentioned that some
                    "deleterious plant" might be the active agent; Faux related that poisonous herbs caused "trembles"
                    among cattle; Long spoke of the effect of "noxious plants"; and Flagg said that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> settlers ascribed the disease "to the milk or to the flesh of cows feeding upon certain
                    unknown poisonous plants." The medical literature of the thirties, forties, and fifties, in
                    general, mentioned the possibility of poisonous milk caused by cows eating injurious vegetation. A
                    variety of other theories also were advanced. Poisonous dew and volatile minerals that evaporated
                    from the earth at night, condensing on the herbage, there to await ingestion by grazing herds;
                    miasmata, the early conception of a germ theory; micro-organisms; various poisonous minerals, such
                    as compounds of arsenic, copper, lead, and cobalt, as well as poisonous springs-all these were
                    advanced as explanations of the origin of the malady. In 1879, for example, the National Board of
                    Health suggested the idea that a spirillum in the blood, akin to that observed in relapsing fever,
                    was the activating agent. Two members of the bacteriological laboratory of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1909, cautiously suggested that a bacillus, which they named <hi rend="i">B.
                        lactimorbi,</hi> possibly was the cause. About the same time, it was stated <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-040-2-007"/> positively that milksickness was due to aluminum phosphate.</p>
            <p>All of these theories, although they seemed based upon conclusive experimental evidence, were
                    incorrect. The solution was found only when attention once more turned back to the poisonous-plant
                    theory as advanced by the earliest commentators. Although many plants were suspectedMdashpoison ivy,
                    water hemlock, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> creeper, coralberry, spurge, mushrooms, marsh marigoldMdashthe hunt finally centered
                    upon the white snakeroot which William Barbee, of Marshall, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and David Dale Owen had identified in 1840 as <hi rend="i">Eupatorium
                    ageratoides,</hi> although it now is called <hi rend="i">Eupatorium urticaefolium.</hi> Barbee and
                    Owen, however, were not among the first to distrust the white snakeroot. In 1837 an <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> farmer definitely advanced the view that the plant, when eaten by cattle whose milk was
                    drunk by settlers, induced the disease. William J. Vermilya's thesis was published in the
                    annual report of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> State Board of Agriculture in 1858 and was reprinted in the report for 1873 when
                    Buckeye farmers were cautioned against the root and told that, were the plant well known, a few
                    hours would be sufficient to eradicate it entirely from any farm.</p>
            <p>The plant itself was not difficult to recognize. Its heads ranged from three to many flowers. The
                    flowers were perfect, involcre, cylindrical, or bell shaped with a flat receptacle. The corolla was
                    five toothed and the achenia, five angled. A perennial herb, it often was sprinkled with bitter
                    resinous dots, with generally corymboic heads of white, bluish, or purple blossoms which appear near
                    the close of summer.</p>
            <p>Even though <hi rend="i">Eupatorium urticaefolium</hi> was well described and substantial evidence
                    offered to prove its connection with "trembles" in cattle and milksickness in man long before the
                    turn of the nineteenth century, the Bureau of Plant Industry of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Department of Agriculture maintained in 1908 that "it certainly cannot be said that it
                    has been proved that milksickness is due to any constituent of <hi rend="i">Eupatorium
                        ageratoides."</hi> But intense investigation now began, and in 1917 it was demonstrated
                    conclusive- that the white snakeroot was toxic, although the active agent had not been isolated. Ten
                    years later, as the result of a long chain of biochemical and pharmacological experimentation, the
                    actual culprit was apprehended, not only in the white <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-040-2-008"/>

            <p>These plants, extending over a rather broad area, contain a poisonous substance known as tremetol
                    which is the cause of milksickness. Nancy Hanks Lincoln in reality died from tremetol poisoning as
                    the result of drinking milk from a cow that had fed upon the white snakeroot. Tremetol is a viscous
                    levorotatory oil with a pleasant aromatic odor. Its chemical composition is C<hi rend="sup">16</hi>H<hi rend="sup">22</hi>O<hi rend="sup">3.</hi> It is classed chemically with the higher
                    alcohols, is insoluble in water, acids, and alkalies and is soluble in the common organic solvents,
                    alcohol, chloroform, form, and ether. Taken into the body and digested, tremetol will produce all
                    the symptoms which Mrs. Lincoln manifested during the early days of her illness. The pronounced odor
                    of acetone which was on her breath and present in her urine (even though no frontiersmen knew of the
                    acetonurometer) was a ketosis, a condition of faulty metabolism which, in reality, was a secondary
                    manifestation of chronic tremetol poisoning.</p>
            <p>Nancy Lincoln, exhausted by persistent vomiting, probably was put to bed within two or three days
                    after the onset of the disease where she lay restless, her usually active mind dulled. At times
                    neighbors, such as William Wood, came and sat with her. Perhaps they ministered without her
                    knowledge, for semi-consciousness frequently closes in upon the milksick patient. Obstinate
                    constipation, a scant urine of pale color, and continued pains in the abdomen must have been
                    present. She probably complained of pain in the calves of her legs and of stiffness. Her hiccoughs
                    were of the same type as that of other victims of the murrain. Had her husband asked to see her
                    tongue, he would have observed it to be red and unusually large with a slight tremor and parched
                    into fissures of white. Her eyes were rolled upward with the pupils reacting sluggishly and the
                    ocular conjunctiva <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-040-2-009"/> reddened. A yellow, gummy discharge was
                    present at each canthus. The abdomen, as the disease progressed, became scaphoid and later
                    tympanites, or distention of the abdominal walls, appeared. No peristalsis was present. The patient
                    now was entering the final stages.</p>
            <p>If she followed the typical pattern, she lay on her back with her head turned to the side and her
                    legs drawn up with the knees spread apart. A decided odor of acetone was on the breath and in the
                    urine. Her respiration was becoming irregular and of the Cheyne-Stokes character, a succession of
                    respirations becoming progressively shorter and more shallow, then an intermission of varying
                    duration, followed by progressive increase in depth and length. Such respiration always signifies
                    approaching death. The skin became cold and clammy. Had her pulse been taken, it probably would have
                    been irregular and varying from seventy to one hundred and twenty. The temperature of all milksick
                    individuals is subnormal, and Mrs. Lincoln's probably never exceeded ninety-nine degrees.
                    Blood pressure possibly ranged from sixty-seven to ninety-five.</p>
            <p>Before prostration and final coma prevented it, Nancy Lincoln called her two children, Sarah and
                    Abraham, to her and told them "to be good to their father, to each other, and to reverence
                    God." Not long after that she must have slipped into complete coma and died quietly on the
                    seventh day of her illness. She passed away in OctoberMdashperhaps the fifthMdashand was buried in a
                    box made from rough lumber and joined by wooden pegs. Not until sometime later did a visiting
                    Baptist preacher visit Pigeon Creek and preach a funeral sermon over the graves of Nancy Lincoln,
                    her foster parents, and Mrs. Brooner.</p>
            <p>Had autopsy been an established procedure in the backwoods during the early decades of the nineteenth
                    century, a pathologist's post-mortem knife would have exposed the terrific organic changes
                    produced in Mrs. Lincoln by her seven-day sickness. The mucosa of the stomach were highly inflamed,
                    indicating an intense gastritis; both intestines were distended with gas, the reason for her
                    tympanites or "drum belly"; the mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged and possibly inflamed; and her
                    liver was much enlarged, yellowish-red in appearance, and hard as if stuffed with fat. Although the
                    pancreas and spleen were normal, the kidneys probably were enlarged, perhaps as much as one-third.</p>
            <p>Further examination would have revealed fatty changes <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-040-2-010"/> in the
                    ventricles and perhaps edema of the heart. Many small areas of atelectasis were present in the lungs
                    which indicated a pulmonary collapse occasioned, not by a disease in the lungs themselves, but by
                    the prolonged weakness so characteristic of milksickness. The kidneys revealed intense diffuse
                    parenchymatous, an inflammation of the parenchyma, and well-defined glomerulitis, or inflammation of
                    the Malpighian bodies of the organ. Microscopic analysis would have discovered that the nuclei of
                    liver cells were greatly diminished in number. No pathological changes would have taken place in the
                    brain. Findings such as these would confirm a diagnosis of milksickness.</p>
            <p>Even though the cause of milksickness now has been determined, treatment of the patient is
                    precarious, relapses are common, and mortality is high. Today medical care consists of supportive
                    measures, combating the ketosis, and relieving the constipation. The use of enemas of glucose and
                    sodium bicarbonate is recognized procedure. Rest is absolutely essential, and a milk diet is
                    indicated, provided the milk is not infected. Within certain limitation, Mrs. Lincoln probably could
                    have received about as effective medical aid from her family and neighbors as any modern physician
                    could give. Most frontier housewives kept a supply of saleratus for use in baking. This could well
                    have been used as a substitute for the refined sodium bicarbonate. The woods were adequately
                    supplied with honey trees. A clyster composed of warm water, honey, and saleratus would have
                    furnished a substitute for an enema of glucose and sodium bicarbonate. Enemata apparatus was not
                    unknown to the pioneer who, if he could not afford a cheap French enema pipe, could easily
                    manufacture one-as many did-at home. A hog's bladder and a hollow reed served time and
                    again as crude, but effective, enema apparatus. Whisky usually was available on the frontier, and if
                    whisky and honey had been given Mrs. Lincoln during the early days of her illness she possibly would
                    have reacted promptly and successfully. Administration of whisky causes an ester of tremetol to be
                    formed which is less toxic and, as the result of physiological changes, helps to liberate the poison
                    and to combat the ketosis. The saleratus would have relieved the acidosis, and the enema would have
                    combatted the constipation.</p>
            <p>Yet with practically all the agents for treatment at hand, Mrs. Lincoln died, as did so many
                    settlers, a victim of medical ignorance and of one of the great scourges of the western
                frontier.</p>

            <p>When a boy of sixteen, my grandfather came with his parents to the territory of Indiana. He lived
                    seventy years on the farm his father hewed from the wilderness, until I was sixteen years old. He
                    had one older brother and eight younger brothers and sisters. Besides my grandfather, I remember
                    three of these; and of them, the oldest sister was buried at the same time as he, while the youngest
                    of his brothers was buried on my twenty-first birthday. Many others of the first settlers in our
                    neighborhood lived there until I was nearly grown. All of them were willing to reminisce of their
                    childhood and youth-often more willing to talk than we children were to listen. So my lack of
                    greater and more accurate knowledge of what the early settlers did and how they lived is chiefly due
                    to the inattention and faulty memory of a boy.</p>
            <p>Before there were any permanent settlements in southeastern Indiana, the settlement of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> had been slowly advancing westward for a number of years as a result of constant
                    encroachments on the hunting grounds of the Indians, followed by their acts of retaliation and then
                    by battles with the western militia which drove the Red Men still further back. After the Battle of
                    the Fallen Timbers, General Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> compelled the defeated chieftains to sign a treaty at Greenville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1795, which opened to white settlers the territory of southwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and a triangular strip in what is now Indiana. This triangle embraced all the land
                    between the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>-Indiana state line and a line which forms the western boundary of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> counties and which extends from opposite the <geogName>Kentucky River</geogName>
                    northeastward to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> boundary. The triangle included the sites of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Moores Hill, <placeName>

            <p>After that battle but before the treaty, while the tribes were still claiming everything west of the
                    Great Miami River under a previous treaty, two men, who had crossed the river to shoot wild hogs on

                    be said to the Red Men's credit, however, that they did not violate treaties once they
                    entered into them. While trading parties were constantly crossing this ceded strip for many years,
                    going to and returning from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> where they sold their furs and purchased supplies, nobody feared or even thought very
                    much about the Indians after <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s treaty was made. Sons of the settlers would play with the Indian boys at
                    ball, running, wrestling, or shooting at a mark with no more quarrelling and less ill will than
                    often attended contests between white boys from rival neighborhoods.</p>
            <p>So when my ancestors reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> and learned that earlier arrivals already had taken up the public lands for half a
                    dozen miles back into the wilderness along the small stream that empties into the <geogName>Ohio
                        River</geogName> there from the northwest, they did not hesitate to go a mile beyond the last
                    settler to locate their claim. At first hilltops were purchased only as parts of farms that extended
                    from the valleys where the supply of water was less uncertain before wells and cisterns were dug,
                    and not all of the hilltops were appropriated that far back.</p>
            <p>Although these settlers had gone deepest into the woods in that direction, they were only a mile
                    beyond a neighbor who had come in as a hunter and trapper half a dozen years before. When the land
                    was opened for settlement, he had entered his half section of 320 acres on which his cabin stood and
                    had stayed to clear ground, list himself as a future purchaser, and to plant crops.</p>
            <p>Another mile down the creek was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a settlement of New Englanders who had come four or five years before to take up land
                    on a government warrant for service in the Revolution. They had acquired a tract which extended
                    across the valley and out on the hills at either side and embraced what was regarded as the head of
                    navigation on the creek. This was the point to which the water of the <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName>, backing into the creek in times of flood, would make it deep enough for flatboats,
                    keelboats, and light bateaus loaded there to be floated to the river. This put the settlers in close
                    touch with civilization, as typified by small clusters of log huts at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the inhabitants were beginning to specialize a little in the work that each
                    should do. This New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> settlement built an academy and was called <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-040-2-013"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName> until high waters backing in from the river floods made it a ghost town. Here they had
                    built a mill, a blacksmith shop, and a wagon-making shop. They had brought in a small colony of
                    workmen which included tanners, shoemakers, and weavers. By force of necessity, all of these lived
                    partly by hunting and fishing; and each had his own garden and patches of corn, wheat, and oats
                    cultivated among the stumps and fire-scorched tree trunks in the creek bottoms.</p>
            <p>It was late autumn in the year 1811 when my ancestors reached their new home. They had scarcely
                    arrived when the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> was fought 150 miles to the northwest. The Massacre of Pigeon's Roost, which
                    occurred approximately seventy-five miles southwest, and the War of 1812 soon followed. No doubt
                    these poor strangers, who had but recently left the quiet countryside of Yorkshire and until a few
                    weeks previous had been since living among the farms and towns of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> that then had been settled more than two hundred years, wished themselves back where
                    they came from. But <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> and Pigeon's Roost were far away through trackless woods, and there did not
                    exist any quicker means of coming from either place than on foot or horseback. One could only thread
                    through the dense forest with its tangled undergrowth, or follow the windings of some path made by
                    wild animals, such as buffalo, elk, and deer, in their migrations, or plod along the rocky bed of a
                    crooked stream. These paths, widened by the ax of an occasional hunter, supplemented the creek bed
                    as a substitute for roads. Carts made with the wheels of wagons in which the family had crossed the
                    mountains could pick their way up and down the creek to a nearby settlement with light loads.</p>
            <p>The Indians having been defeated and chased away toward <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and the militia already patrolling the back country, the most immediate dangers were
                    the rigors of approaching winter and the lack of any place to plant grain or vegetables when winter
                    should be past. Temporary shelter was found in an abandoned cabin, such as squatters intent only on
                    hunting and trapping had built here and there along the streams and near the springs. Until wells or
                    cisterns should be provided, settlers, squatters, and travellers alike must depend for water on the
                    surface supply; so all the first homes were built close to streams or by flowing springs. The
                    accommodations which this cabin afforded were supplemented <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-040-2-014"/> by
                    temporary shelters of poles and rails roofed with wild grass, in front of which fires in the open
                    air consumed great heaps of logs. If the cold became very severe, all could crowd into the one room
                    and half-floored loft of the cabin.</p>
            <p>Besides this one log cabin in reasonable repair, there were the tumbled remains of two more that once
                    had stood on the creek bank within the mile-long tract which the settlers were purchasing. Each
                    squatter who had built a cabin had killed the large trees, cut down the smaller ones, and dug out
                    the bushes from a small patch of ground in which to plant corn and vegetables while he lived there.
                    During that first winter, at intervals between hunting and fishing for food, the men and boys of
                    this family worked long and hard at reopening and enlarging these small clearings in preparation for
                    spring planting. Putting in crops without plows, harrows, or planters where the stumps, large and
                    small, almost covered the ground was no light task. Wherever the sun could shine through an opening
                    in the trees on a few square feet of soil, holes for planting seeds were dug among the roots and
                    stumps with a hoe.</p>
            <p>By utilizing old clearings and working long hours every day to enlarge them, preparation was made
                    before spring was far advanced for planting a few small patches around which the indispensable
                    fences were constructed to keep out foraging animals, wild and tame. Fences, instead of being
                    purchased at a lumberyard in the form of sawed posts and rolls of wire with bags of staples, were
                    made in one of three ways. Posts could be split with axes and wedges from the logs of trees that had
                    been chopped down, cut into rail lengths after the limbs and brush were removed, split to fence rail
                    size, and then carried, dragged, or hauled to where they were to be used. Or a sort of fence might
                    be constructed by chopping into the sides of a succession of small trees along the line of the
                    intended fence so that each would fall upon and partly against the one before it; and then from the
                    tops of this succession of felled trees and other brush, a barrier was woven that few animals would
                    push through, especially if faced with brush from thorn trees. Or fences could be built of the
                    native stone, as were thousands of yards of fence on this farm, by picking up stones from the
                    hillsides, moving them to where the fence was wanted, and then building them <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-040-2-015"/> without mortar into a wall about five feet high and almost two feet
                    thick.</p>
            <p>Observing family worship morning and evening when they gathered for breakfast and supper, with grace
                    before and after each meal, was as much a part of the daily routine as tramping the woods with dog
                    and gun to supply meat, setting lines to catch fish, clearing the ground of trees and brush for
                    planting crops, turning the spinning wheel to make thread, or working the loom to weave cloth.
                    Everyone was expected to be diligent in all these matters from daylight until dark except the very
                    small children, who might be indulged in morning naps. Some of the neighbors had come from farther
                    south and had an expression for this as working "from kin to kaint," that is, working from
                    the time they "kin" see until, because of the gathering darkness, they "kaint" see.</p>
            <p>After food, their most urgent need was for shelter. All were resolved not to pass another winter
                    without better quarters than a squatter's cabin and open-faced lean-tos. A site for their
                    intended home had been selected farther down the creek on the east bank. This was near the center of
                    the square mile of forest they were purchasing about one-half mile south of the squatter's
                    cabin, and the rocky bed of the creek made a pathway through the dense growth of trees and
                    underbrush from one to the other.</p>
            <p>As soon as their few patches of corn and vegetables had been planted, the father and four older boys,
                    aged fourteen to nineteen years, with only axes for tools, began preparations for building a house.
                    Timber grew so thick that trees with straight trunks of nearly equal size, eighteen or twenty feet
                    long, were readily found and felled. The logs trimmed of branches were dragged and rolled to the
                    chosen site of the home close to a spring flowing into the creek. Not many weeks passed until great
                    piles of logs stacked at the four sides of a rectangle cleared of brush and stumps showed
                    preparations for a raising. This term, applied to the process of piling up logs as the walls of a
                    house or barn, designated a supreme effort of all the men for miles around to help their neighbor on
                    the great day and a gathering of their wives and daughters to prepare and serve a bounteous dinner
                    of whatever food the wilderness afforded and perhaps to sandwich in some quilting. But it also meant
                    gaiety and merrymaking after the logs walls were up and the dinner eaten.</p>
            <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-040-2-016"/>
            <p>The most distinguished persons at a raising were the corner men. One at each of the four corners of
                    the building, they were responsible for the strength and solidity as well as the symmetry of the
                    structure. With no tool but an ax, no measure but his eye, no plummet but a stone or chip hung by a
                    string or piece of bark, and no scaffold but a pole laid across the corner which he was to
                    supervise, each corner man, moving higher as the building was erected, cut a notch on one side of
                    each log for a "saddle" to rest on the log below and shaped a "seat" exactly to fit it on the upper
                    side of that log. His work as to form, distance from the end of the log, and depth of cut must
                    exactly correspond with the work of the other three corner men; and each log must be set exactly
                    above the one below so that the dozen or more logs on each of the four sides would rise to the same
                    height and the ends would meet in four symmetrical corners, all perpendicular and each at a perfect
                    right angle.</p>
            <p>Each log was lifted by a group of men to the height of their shoulders when pike poles tipped with
                    pointed bits of iron were set under it, with which many men lifted it to the top of the log wall
                    already erected, for delivery to the corner men. Two of them, each standing on his improvised
                    scaffold, would receive it from the pike poles, determine how it would best fit at his corner, roll
                    it over and, with his ax, cut a notch for a saddle and trim the log below into shape for the seat.
                    Together they would roll the log into place as part of the wooden wall, straighten each corner with
                    an improvised plumb bob, and receive another log pushed up by the men on the ground. The corner
                    man's reputation and future employment in this capacity depended on his work's
                    resulting in a perfect corner, as tested by the practiced eye of his fellows and by the plummet and
                    measurements, all of which tests would be applied immediately after the walls were up.</p>
            <p>Smaller logs, each shorter than the one below, were put across each end where the roof was to begin,
                    as supports for the roof and as end walls for the loft. They carried the building up from the eaves
                    to the gable where a ridgepole was fastened. Having achieved a triumph as architects without
                    measurements or drawings of either plan or detail, and builders without tools, the corner men were
                    expected to climax the entertainment by standing on their heads on the ridgepole.</p>
            <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-040-2-017"/>
            <p>A call to dinner followed the ridgepole performance. This was long before total abstinence had been
                    thought of in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or backwoods America. It was half a century before any serious attempt was made in
                    America to tax the manufacture and sale of spirits except for the shortlived undertaking to collect
                    an excise tax in the Atlantic states, which provoked the Whisky Rebellion. Whisky and brandy could
                    be and were made at little stills in every neighborhood and were sold for a few cents a gallon or
                    the equivalent in trade. Even the most rigid moralists then insisted that drinking should stop just
                    short of drunkenness. Thomas Jefferson was urging the manufacture and sale of beer as a temperance
                    measure to combat the excessive use of alcohol. But the whisky jug must circulate at a raising or
                    many of the neighbors would go home.</p>
            <p>The practice of beginning the work before sunrise and getting the logs in place before noon was in
                    some degree a safety measure, for the more often the bottle had been passed, the less certain were
                    the drinkers' movements in lifting logs above their heads on pike poles; and accidents, even fatal
                    ones, which were blamed on strong drink were not unknown. As tea and coffee could not be obtained
                    and whisky was plentiful and cheap, a toddy-or homebrewed beer among the more sedate-was often drunk
                    at the dinner table; and few families were without a jug of whisky, whether used sparingly or
                    freely. The long contest to stop the use of whisky at raisings, in the harvest field, and other
                    places where working for each other was combined with feasting and merrymaking began in that
                    neighborhood soon afterward and raged with much acrimony until the Civil War. At this time, however,
                    neither liquor nor slavery had become the controversial questions they were later.</p>
            <p>The new settlers did not lack food, although they had arrived so recently on Tanners Creek that they
                    had not produced or harvested any crops. The lack of markets or stores within many miles, of roads
                    except bridle trails along the creek beds or footpaths worn by animals, of means of travel except by
                    foot or horseback, of money with which to buy, or of anything for sale if one had money did not
                    prevent their having an abundance.</p>
            <p>The unbroken forest, though sometimes an implacable enemy, was to them a generous friend. Herds of
                    deer and <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-040-2-018"/> occasionally a few elk, many bears, myriads of
                    squirrels and other small game, and even wild hogs which had strayed from older settlements and
                    wandered in the woods for many porcine generations insured abundance. Fish were even more numerous.
                    Sweet acorns which they called chinquapins, nuts and roots, wild plums and berries, and many kinds
                    of wild plants provided a substitute for bread, fruit, and vegetables. Cows, which the settlers had
                    brought with them or purchased from earlier inhabitants, pastured in the unfenced woods. Neighbors
                    who had come only a short time before had plenty of maple syrup, smaller quantities of maple sugar,
                    and a little cornmeal that they were willing to divide. So there were provisions of a kind in
                    plenty. When seasoned by the hunger that followed honest toil in the open air, the dinner produced
                    by the wives and daughters of all the assembled party was a feast indeed.</p>
            <p>Salt was sadly lacking. Most of the little they had was found at the bottom of a kettle after it had
                    been kept boiling many hours with water from some little salt spring or salt lick such as the wild
                    animals frequented. After boiling away a kettleful of the water, a few grains of salt were nearly
                    all their meager supply. Some salt could be purchased at prohibitive prices in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, having been carried by pack horses across the mountains or perhaps brought up the
                    river from Shawnee town, beyond the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, on a keelboat. These boats came upstream by the slow process of carrying a rope up the
                    river and tying it to a tree, turning by hand a windlass on the boat until it was drawn up to that
                    tree, when the rope would be unwound and carried forward to repeat the process more than a dozen
                    times in a mile.</p>
            <p>Such luxuries as salt fish and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> molasses were also lacking. Tea, coffee, and chocolate were unknown; but infusions of
                    roots, herbs, and grains, like drinks made of sassafras roots, the buds and leaves of spicewood, or
                    of roasted barley, supplied their place.</p>
            <p>Canning food as we know it had not been discovered; and even if it had been, it would have been
                    impossible to manufacture or bring to this wilderness tin cans, glass jars, or even stone jugs which
                    came into use a hundred years ago.</p>
            <p>The only respite a backwoods settler had from his diet of unsalted or poorly salted fresh game or
                    fish, maple syrup, * * *rnmeal, and substitutes for grains he had known in his <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-040-2-019"/> European or Atlantic Coast home was to float a flatboat down the creek
                    and down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> rivers more than a thousand miles to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Many floated timber in the form of staves and hoop poles to make barrels for West <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> sugar and hogsheads for tobacco, and took along the corn, hogs, pickled pork, and other
                    farm products of their own and of their neighbors. To avoid spending most of their gains for a
                    return passage, they often walked back home. My paternal grandfather, having found the market at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> unsatisfactory, once crossed to Havana and sold his cargo, returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>, and walked home from there through what was then a trackless forest for most of the
                    way. He carried the proceeds of his sale in gold coin sewed into a belt around his waist and, being
                    so completely off the beaten track, felt little fear that he would be suspected of having enough
                    money to pay for robbing him.</p>
            <p>As an alternative to floating with the river current to the Gulf of Mexico, perhaps one might walk to
                    the Atlantic Coast nearly as far away in another direction. Men from Tanners Creek did walk to the
                    coast and back; one of my great-grandfathers did. There was no relief from hitchhiking, for most of
                    one's fellow travelers were also afoot or were driving oxen that drew heavy loads at a pace
                    much slower than one could walk. A horse might be ridden, but a horse must be fed; and feed was
                    scarce and expensive when there was no money for any use but buying land from the government and far
                    too little for that use. Even if enough furs, then almost the only medium of exchange, were taken
                    along to pay the way of a traveler and two horses, the second horse with a packsaddle to carry the
                    furs was almost essential.</p>
            <p>But I have wandered far from the raising of this new house. Some raisings were followed by dancing.
                    Some people would bring horses to such a gathering and, betting on the favorite, would race them
                    through any opening in the woods that was sufficiently clear of underbrush. This, however, never
                    occurred on section seventeen in the valley of Tanners Creek. There the festivities which followed a
                    hearty dinner after the logs were in place began with singing a hymn and offering an extemporaneous
                    prayer.</p>
            <p>The older folks, however, soon had their devotions to themselves. Athletic sports, foot races,
                    jumping, tree climbing or shinning up, throwing the bar, and kindred sports attracted <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-040-2-020"/> the crowd, where all might look on even if few could excel. Real
                    athletes were among them, though their colleges were only the primeval forest with the homely
                    teachings of frontier parents. An eighty-year-old man who had been one of these youths boasted that,
                    when half grown, with a running start he could clear a bar held higher than his head.</p>
            <p>We may be inclined to suspect that dining alfresco, singing hymns, engaging in athletic sports, and
                    watching from the side lines were not all that entertained the young people at a raising or similar
                    gathering. Possibly they found time to discuss other subjects that still hold the attention of boys
                    and girls. At any rate, in a few years all the four daughters and five of the sons were married and
                    living in homes of their own, built in like manner of the logs cut from their new farms in the deep
                    woods. The other son had been killed by a falling tree. These nine who married presented their
                    parents with a total of ninety grandchildren, nor was this an unusual family in those early days.</p>
            <p>The logs being in place, dinner eaten, and a little time given to play, the guests started for home
                    with the approach of sundown. The nearest neighbor lived a mile away, and most of them much farther.
                    Everybody-men, women, and children-had come on foot except some ill and infirm person who might have
                    been indulged with a horse. To thread their way along an unmarked trail through an unbroken forest,
                    the man and his wife, with perhaps a baby in arms and other children not much larger, needed
                    daylight. Panthers and other wild animals were said to be more dangerous after dark, and in any case
                    it is much easier to get lost in the woods when it is dark than when the sun is shining. So the
                    lengthening shadows were accepted by the guests as a warning to start for home.</p>
            <p>After the raising was completed, many days of hard work were required of the family to complete the
                    home. Floors of puncheons, or thick slabs split like rough boards from huge logs, were to be
                    provided both below and in the loft. An outside chimney had to be built at each end with fireplaces
                    which would burn cordwood four feet long, the standard length. The logs of the outside walls must be
                    cut for an opening large enough to allow each fireplace to open at full width into the room. Doors
                    and windows must also <pb n="121" id="VAA4025-040-2-021"/> be cut and the severed ends of the logs
                    secured to hold the wooden walls in place.</p>
            <p>All this cutting was done with axes, for axmen of that day could cut a surface almost as smooth and
                    straight across a log as if it had been sawed-and the settlers had no saws. Before long the nearby
                    mill had saws and saw pits where two men, one standing on a platform and the other in a pit below,
                    would pull a saw up and down to cut boards from which shutters, doors, and benches were fashioned.
                    The blacksmiths brought wrought iron down the river from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, which, by hammering and working, was made so ductile that the smith could on his anvil
                    pound out a nail of any desired length and with a head the size of a thumb nail. Such a nail might
                    be driven through three inches of wood and clinched on the other side by bending it over and
                    hammering it down. This way of making nails was so slow and laborious that a mere handful
                    represented the value of an acre of wild land.</p>
            <p>This family had the rare good fortune to own an auger as well as axes, so they could bore holes and
                    drive pins to fasten braces in place. By this means they not only secured the sawed ends of the logs
                    at all of the openings, but they even contrived wooden hinges for their doors and shutters. These
                    shutters and doors were made of puncheons as wide as the opening to be closed, for in that primitive
                    forest there were plenty of trees four or five feet across the stump. These slabs swung on
                    improvised hinges and were fastened shut at night by a wooden bar laid across behind.</p>
            <p>As the settlers prospered, however, they obtained doors of sawed planks fastened together with nails.
                    One of these doors used in the outside kitchen and dining room built near the log structure is yet
                    in use as a kitchen door of the stone house which succeeded the log cabin. At first there was no
                    glass in the windows, and the choice was between shutters which, when closed, kept out all the
                    daylight and air as well as the cold, or an oiled cloth or paper which let in some cold and little
                    light, or the unchecked weather that might blow in with the shutters open. Window casings and sashes
                    were supplied later by local carpenters. Glass windows for the home and those yet in use in the
                    chapel were constructed with a few very small window panes which were floated down <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-040-2-022"/> the river from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then already fifty years old and beginning to be a manufacturing center.</p>
            <p>The open woodfire furnished almost the only light they had after the short autumn twilight; for this
                    was many years before the source of kerosene was discovered in the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>,
                    and the market for whale oil was a thousand miles away. Until they produced their own tallow, they
                    could not enjoy even the luxury of dim light from a tallow dip made by repeatedly dipping a wick
                    into melted grease.</p>
            <p>Putting on the roof was not a light task. Piles of clapboards or shakes split and rived from oak
                    logs, three or four feet long, six or eight inches wide, and approximately onehalf inch in
                    thickness, were prepared as well as long poles split down the middle in order to have one side flat.
                    These shakes were laid on like shingles. As each row was in place, they were fastened down with the
                    flattened weight poles laid lengthwise of the building and tied down at each end with green bark to
                    hold on the roof.</p>
            <p>Another task to be done was chinking the spaces between the logs, for there were always spaces left
                    between even the smoothest logs. Since no lath or plaster was available to close these cracks, it
                    had to be done by driving in wedges of wood or stone and then applying paster or mud in trying,
                    never with complete success, to make the chinking airtight. When the work must be done hastily, as
                    in the case of this family getting ready for a winter of which the early frosts were already
                    beginning to chill the air, the chinking must be of wood with clay mud until spring.</p>
            <p>But closing the cracks between the logs did not complete the work. After getting the walls up, the
                    roof on, the doors and windows hung, and the cracks chinked, the tasks of the family in completing
                    its new home had only just begun. Four rooms, substantially eighteen by twenty feet, were to be
                    furnished in addition to the outside kitchen. The one room of a trapper's cabin in which
                    they camped while preparing to build their own house was only poorly furnished by the small stock of
                    household goods which they had dragged five hundred miles across the country, floated another five
                    hundred down the river, and had brought into the wilderness beyond where beaten footpaths extended.</p>
            <p>Dining room furniture was the most pressing additional need. The dining room was capable of many
                    uses. When <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-040-2-023"/> neither the outside kitchen nor the great outdoors
                    was used for that purpose, it was the living room as well as kitchen. Three times a day the
                    appetites of ten growing children must be satisfied. The children and many visitors sometimes tested
                    the capacity of even a room of this size; for hospitality was not only a cardinal virtue, but an
                    absolute necessity in a new country without places of public entertainment, where settlers were
                    constantly arriving either to purchase the wild lands and open farms for themselves or passing
                    through to locations farther west. So the dining table had to be a large one with other tables in
                    reserve. For a table they split from a large log a slab about four feet wide and three or four
                    inches thick and dressed the surface to a semblance of smoothness. Short, stout pegs served as legs.
                    Extension tables might come into the homes of grandchildren or great-grandchildren, but the only
                    method available for increasing their table space, which was planned for the parents and ten
                    children with possible maids and workmen or visitors, was to multiply the number of tables or to set
                    the one table a second time. Benches of a kind were made by setting up sections of split logs on
                    similar pegs, and these were used also for the family and friends to sit about the fire in the
                    kitchendining-living room, subject to interruption when cooking was to be done there.</p>
            <p>Waiting until the older persons were served and the tables were reset was one of the hardships of
                    childhood. Many tales were told of the hired man or perhaps the preacher or other guest whose
                    fondness for some scarce article of food, such as early peas, new potatoes, or young squirrel, would
                    induce him to take helping after helping until none was left for the little ones. What they thought
                    of him as they watched through a crevice in the log wall and what they said where their elders could
                    not hear was far from complimentary. Even then, selfish and inconsiderate persons with big appetites
                    sometimes visited in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Food was cooked in, upon, and before the great fire of logs heaped against a backlog which, being too
                    large for carrying, was dragged and rolled into place. It always burned brightly in cold weather and
                    never wholly died out. Fire was saved from day to day by carefully covering the live embers with
                    ashes at night. If allowed to go out, it could be rekindled only with sparks from a flint and steel
                    struck into a box of <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-040-2-024"/> tinder and carefully nursed to a blaze.
                    The alternative was to use burning coals borrowed from a neighbor and carried perhaps a mile through
                    the woods, tended carefully to prevent its going out on the way. If sticks were ever rubbed together
                    until they ignited, I never heard it mentioned.</p>
            <p>Under the logs were beds of glowing red coals, almost hot enough to burst into flames, and quantities
                    of ashes. Eggs and potatoes were roasted in the ashes under the coals. Other vegetables and meat or
                    fish were wrapped in damp leaves or cornhusks and buried with burning coals heaped over them. They
                    emerged cooked to a turn after the fashion of a clambake or barbecue. The heavy iron pot with a
                    thick lip, familiarly called a Dutch oven, was an important utensil for cooking in every backwoods
                    home. When it was set upon a bed of burning coals and the lid covered with more coals, no oven could
                    be more efficient.</p>
            <p>The outside kitchen, built soon after the new house, had its own fireplace and room for all the
                    family to dine unless crowded out by guests or workmen. It had an immense oven built of native stone
                    and clay for use in general baking. A fire would burn on the floor of this oven until it was
                    thoroughly heated, when the wood, coals, and ashes were raked out and replaced with a
                    week's supply of bread and pies for the family and its visitors. During religious
                    festivals, such as the quarterly church conferences or camp meetings in the nearby woods, the crowds
                    which came taxed the oven's capacity for days at a time. The test whether or not this oven
                    was hot enough to remove the fire and put in the baking was made by the hands and faces of the
                    cooks. Thermometers did not reach the remote frontier until later.</p>
            <p>This method of cooking with an oven of stone or brick which gradually cooled while its contents were
                    baking had advantages which kept it in use by some bakers long after cookstoves with ovens were
                    introduced, even down to the time that ovens came to be electrically controlled. Taking out the
                    ashes and burning embers and disposing of them was always inconvenient. Gradual disappearance of the
                    supply of firewood, the manufacture for commercial sale of such articles as lard, hominy, and soap,
                    which once were made by every household in its own backyard, and the growing supply of cookstoves
                    with ovens led to the disuse of the stone or brick oven. Such an oven, built against the side of the
                    house, has <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-040-2-025"/> been reproduced by Eli Lilly where it formerly stood
                    at his place south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> where William Conner once had an Indian agency. The oven built into the end of the
                    stone house which succeeded the log house we have been describing, though long unused and badly
                    wrecked, may still be seen.</p>
            <p>Of the other rooms built at that time, the one on the ground floor was to be occupied by the parents
                    and shared by two or three of the very little folks who slept in a trundle bed. One loft was
                    assigned to the older girls and the maids who helped with the spinning, weaving, and other indoor
                    work by which the family was provided with everything we now buy at clothing stores, dry goods
                    stores, and milliners. All work of that kind was done by hand, as the first sewing machine had not
                    yet been invented. The other loft was a bedroom for the sons and for the men hired not only to help
                    clear the land and plant and harvest crops entirely without machinery and almost without anything
                    that a victory garden now requires as implements, but also to manufacture on the farm nearly
                    everything that we now purchase from our tailors, shoe merchants, harness shops, and hardware
                    stores.</p>
            <p>Labor was in such demand that, as the new settlers arrived from the states farther east and from
                    Europe, these lofts, each as large as four ordinary bedrooms of today, were usually full and
                    sometimes overflowing, even when crowds of visitors were not being entertained. When the quarterly
                    conferences and other festivals brought visitors on horseback or on foot from as far away as fifty
                    or sixty miles, the whole family, including the hired men and maids, was expected to vacate their
                    beds. The women and girls slept on pallets spread on the floors of all the rooms except that a
                    bedstead might be set up for the use of some ill or infirm visitor. The men and boys, including the
                    male portion of fifty or more guests who might not improbably be apportioned to the "class
                    leader," which office the father of this family held until his death, slept in the barns or
                    out under the trees. Food and lodging were so plentiful and inexpensive that they were freely
                    shared.</p>
            <p>The few chairs that had been brought with them were taken to the mother's room at the far
                    end of the house, where an open fire always burned in cold or cool weather before which her guests
                    usually were entertained except at mealtime. The mother, less than forty-five years old when <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-040-2-026"/> this house was built and who lived to be almost twice that age,
                    seems always to have been regarded as an aged woman; perhaps she so considered herself, and it may
                    be that her husband's being fifteen years older helped the delusion. Wearing the cap she
                    had donned when she was married, she always dressed in the same plain clothes, without ruffle or
                    ornament, which she had worn from the time she joined John Wesley's church as a young
                    maiden back in Yorkshire.</p>
            <p>Small groups met for prayer meetings and class meetings in her room. Larger meetings filled the house
                    if the weather was too bad to go outdoors. But when the weather was fine, even though cold, they
                    sang, prayed, and preached under the trees, sitting on logs, stumps, benches, or the ground or
                    standing in the background as fancy moved them.</p>
            <p>Substitutes for mattresses were made of homespun bags or ticks stuffed with wild grass, but it was
                    not long until straw was obtained for this purpose. Bedsteads of split logs were succeeded by
                    furniture floated in from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In these a strong cord wound back and forth over pegs driven into the head, foot, and
                    each side rail was a substitute for the springs which later generations think so essential. Just
                    when corded bedsteads of walnut and cherry wood came into the house I cannot say. Many years later,
                    when springs began to be thought necessary, all the old corded bedsteads, less than a dozen in
                    number, were thrown out, with the edict that they become stove wood. Admiring the wild cherry wood
                    and thinking that he was saving something for himself, one of the great-grandsons chose some and put
                    them into the loft above the woodhouse. But what chance has a mere man in household
                    matters? Years afterward, when styles again changed, the old furniture in the loft was
                    discovered and, being refinished and supplied with springs, became the prized possessions of
                    great-great-granddaughters.</p>
            <p>Trundle beds have been mentioned. Many of this generation probably have neither slept in one nor seen
                    one. A trundle bed had corner posts which lifted it just high enough that it would not touch the
                    floor but left it low enough that, when not in use, it might be pushed under one of the beds having
                    high posts and canopies, for which purpose it was fitted with small wheels, like casters, that our
                    forebears called trundles. It was on the same principle as the folding bed later so popular. Two
                    beds, when not in use, occupied <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-040-2-027"/> only the space of one. Many
                    trundle beds were in use in the country districts of southern Indiana until after the Civil War,
                    called the War Between the States. But this is a digression. We were building and furnishing a house
                    in an unbroken wilderness in Indiana territory.</p>
            <p>Heating the rooms so well furnished with outside openings was another question in winter. While the
                    burning logs in the fireplace might temper the cold a little more with the shutters closed, the
                    rooms never were really warm on a cold day. Heavy underclothing was worn in the house as well as
                    outdoors, and a shoulder shawl was a prized possession. Jokers would assert that a man, having taken
                    off his shoes in a log house to warm his feet, had frozen his heels in front of a blazing fire.
                    However gross the exaggeration, there was a hint of truth in the jest.</p>
            <p>The house being roofed, enclosed, chinked, and hastily furnished with improvised benches, tables, and
                    bedsteads so as to be habitable, the process of providing materials and obtaining help was repeated
                    in part to procure a barn with stables for the domestic animals. Logs were again cut and piled, the
                    neighbors rallied, a building erected, and all the incidents of a community dinner of food gleaned
                    from the wilderness and general merrymaking were repeated with the added convenience of a new house
                    and its fireplace for shelter and warmth against the winter which was then upon them. The barn,
                    though not so large as the house, also had a loft, roof, doors, and openings for windows in the
                    loft. The earth served as a floor for the stables, but the loft must be floored with puncheons and a
                    ladder replaced the stairway. Afterward other barns were built of massive timber frames, squared and
                    hewn with axes and adz, enclosed with sawed weather-boarding fastened on with iron nails, and having
                    doors and shutters of sawed planks hung on metal hinges with hooks and staples to fasten them shut
                    or open. The old log barn remained, however, to give shelter to the horses, cows, and pigs and to
                    contain fodder, hay, and grain with which to feed the animals.</p>
            <p>On the night I was born, a bolt of lightning struck this old barn stocked with hay and straw and
                    burned it to the ground. The north end of another building partly enclosed with boards and used as a
                    corncrib was near enough that the boards caught fire, and that building was saved only by <pb n="128" id="VAA4025-040-2-028"/> climbing up and throwing water on the burning boards, aided by
                    a deluge of rain which fell at the opportune moment. As it was, the boards were charred half
                    through, and have remained in that condition to the present time. More than forty years later I
                    heard persons asking about the fire which they thought had recently threatened the building, and a
                    younger generation may be repeating the same question.</p>
            <p>I know I owe an apology for injecting myself, a mere product of yesterday, into this tale of long ago
                    only because one of the log buildings put up for a pioneer family after their first year in the
                    woods was reserved for a holocaust at the time of my arrival on Tanners Creek; but it may help
                    someone to realize better that this is not a tale of fabled antiquity but relates what happened
                    right here within our own state to people who were known and are remembered by many friends and
                    acquaintances.</p>
            <p>The stone chapel, built by this family and their neighbors ten years later at the spot on their farm
                    where the squatter's cabin stood which sheltered them until their own house was built, was
                    constructed in compliance with the views and practices of churches built in Europe in that age,
                    without any means of heating. Now it is provided with a furnace and is still in use as a church and
                    Sunday School room, as well as a cemetery chapel. And the stone house, which greatgrandfather
                    substituted after a score of years for the log structure so hasitly erected, has been handed down by
                    succeeding generations for more than one hundred years and still is the home of his
                    great-grandchildren not so old as others of their generation, who in turn have great-grandchildren
                    of their own.</p>

            <head>A Study of Faculty Appointments at Indiana University, 1824-1937</head>
            <byline>BURTON D. MYERS</byline>
            <p>The legislative act establishing Indiana State Seminary was approved January 20, 1820, but it was not
                    until May, 1824, that buildings were erected and instruction was begun. Although Indiana Seminary
                    became Indiana College in 1828, it was 1830 before the first class was graduated and degrees
                    conferred. In the early years of the University, not only was the number of graduates very small,
                    but the opportunity for those few to earn a living as scholars was at first almost wholly lacking.
                    The records show that the early graduates of Indiana University studied law, theology, or medicine.
                    Others became farmers, entered upon a business career, or taught school. Certain of these graduates
                    attained eminence in fields of their choice, and it is certain that among them were men of great
                    ability. Some of them had careers, a few distinguished, as faculty members in other universities.</p>
            <p>Indiana University was the fiftieth college or university to be established in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Although in the following sixty years, 1820-1880, 330 colleges or universities were
                    established, most were small and struggling institutions; and it was not until the close of that
                    period that in the Midwest the career of the scholar acquired a living basis and became sufficiently
                    attractive to compete with law, medicine, and the ministry for some of the ablest young men of the
                    period. For example, the noted mathematician and astronomer, David Kirkwood, had only one pupil,
                    Francis P. Leavenworth (Indiana University, 1880), who became an astronomer, occupying that chair in
                    the University of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, 1892-1928.</p>
            <p>There were sixty appointees to the faculty of Indiana University in the sixty-one years from 1824 to
                    January 1, 1885, only seven of whom were alumni of Indiana College or Indiana University.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The following table shows the most important details concerning these seven

                                of the preparatory school, etc., are therefore not included in this study. The years a
                                man may have served in any minor capacity are disregarded and his faculty connection is
                                considered as dating from the time of his assumption of duties as an instructor or
                                professor. The members of the clinical faculty of the School of Medicine, and of the
                                departments of Physical Education and Military Training are likewise not included in
                                this study. There are a few exceptions to this latter statement. The deans of the School
                                of Medicine are included. James Sheldon (football) had a teaching appointment in the
                                School of Law. A few military appointees a hundred years ago taught mathematics or
                                surveying and are included.</p>
                            <p>An alumnus of Indiana University is defined as a person having received a baccalaureate
                                or other degree from Indiana University. An appointee not holding a degree from the
                                University at the time he assumed his duties as an instructor or professor is regarded
                                as a nonalumnus. A number of such non-alumni appointees later received an earned or
                                honorary degree from Indiana University, thus becoming alumni. This did not change the
                                fact that their educational status at the time of appointment was that of non-alumni.</p>

                    master's degrees. While these degrees were occasionally earned, it was a common procedure
                    to confer them as a sort of bonus upon holders of the baccalaureate degree who continued for a time
                    in the academic atmosphere, a sort of decoration for a valorous attempt to follow an academic career
                    under very difficult conditions.</p>
            <p>Of these seven appointments, six were temporary-for one or two years only. The one person who
                    remained a long time had the equivalent academic training of the others but in addition had a
                    likable personality. The first three appointments indicate a purpose to establish mathematics or
                    mathematics and civil engineering as part of the curriculum.</p>
            <p>January 1, 1885, is a date in the history of Indiana University ranking in importance second only to
                    January 20, 1820. It marks the end of an early period of foundation, frustration, and near
                    extinction, and the beginning of the present period of gradual progress in the development of the
                    University. A very critical situation in the history of the University was climaxed by the
                    resignation of President Lemuel Moss in November, 1884. The Moss administration, 1875-1884, had been
                    for Indiana University a period of regression. The enrollment for 1875-1876 included 132 arts
                    students, 36 law students, and 125 medical students, a total of 293. Early in the Moss

                                of July 12, 1883, destroyed all university records except one book of minutes of the
                                Board of Trustees, from February 15, 1838, to July 15, 1859.</p>

                                of Indiana University, was sometimes the only source of information regarding very early
                                appointees. Wylie became a member of the faculty in May, 1837. He retired in 1886 at the
                                age of seventy-six. His history was printed five years before his death. He had known
                                personally and intimately all but three members of the faculty of that early day.
                                Baynard R. Hall, John H. Harney, and Ebenezer N. Elliott had left prior to 1837. This
                                work is a most valuable contribution to the history of the University during those early
                                years. With his feet on the "Western slope," and writing from memory, with
                                catalogues and other records mostly destroyed by fire, it is remarkable that he omitted
                                only three members of the university faculty, included in the University's

                    Indiana Medical College faculty was ended. At the close of the school year 1876-1877, the School of
                    Law, started thirty-five years earlier under David McDonald (1842), was dropped. The catalogue for
                    the wear 1884-1885 lists a faculty of eleven professors and instructors and an enrollment of 137
                    students. The Arts School, which was all that was left of Indiana University, had gained five
                    students in ten years.</p>
            <p>Indiana University had not differed greatly from contemporary private or denominational schools
                    before January 1, 1885. Up to that time, the president of Indiana University had been a minister who
                    taught moral philosophy. Daily chapel attendance had been compulsory. The athletic teams of
                    neighboring Indiana colleges were keen competitors to whom Indiana University lost frequently in
                    baseball, football, and later in basketball.</p>
            <p>The election of any scientist to the presidency on December 19, 1884, would have constituted a break
                    with precedent occasioning much unfavorable comment. But in David Starr <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> the courageous trustees had elected, not merely a scientist, but an evolutionist as
                    well. The shock of this action was profound; and Indiana University, which had been called a
                    Presbyterian or a Methodist institution, according to the religious affiliations of its faculty, now
                    became "That Godless Institution," an appellation which clung to it into this century,
                    notwithstanding the deeply religious convictions of <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> and his successors.</p>
            <p>Indiana University at this time was still an educational frontier. Nearly all the things needed to
                    make it a university in fact were still to be done. Total university income, departmental budgets,
                    and library appropriations were small and inadequate, quarters were cramped and crowded, and the
                    faculty was small, underpaid, and overworked. When <placeName>

                    </placeName> conferred with William L. Bryan about his appointment as a member of the university
                    faculty, he opened with the inquiry, "How much more work can you do than the ordinary
                    professor?" This only half facetious inquiry had enough sincerity to impel Bryan, without
                    any objection from <placeName>

                        <p>The best things I did there, were these two; the introduction of the elective system of study

                            professorsâ€¦ .</p>
                        <p>Hitherto new professors had been mainly sought from the East, and as a rule only the second
                            rate of the young men would accept. After some not very successful attempts to do better I
                            promised chairs to certain alumni on condition that they should adequately prepare in Europe
                            or the East. Among these at the beginning were Swain, Bryan, Hoffman, Woodburn and Philputt.</p>
                        <p>Of these Joseph Swain and William Lowe Bryan have successfully filled the

                            staff, character, enthusiasm and loyalty. And to these and to other alumni professors who
                            followed them a large part of the educational progress of Indiana for these thirty years has

                    </placeName> was a pioneer procedure of great significance. Built on a foundation of general
                    education, the elective system enabled a student to go far in some special field. The result was

                    influencing appointments to the faculty of Indiana University during the fifty-two years of these
                    four administrations. Because of the growth of the University, the number of appointments was many
                    times greater than in the years before 1885. In contrast with the sixty appointments to the faculty
                    in the first sixty-one years of the life of the University, there were 896 appointments made in the
                    fifty-two years from 1885 to 1937.</p>

               </table> The fact that only 21.5 per cent of professors and deans and only 20.7 per cent of
                    associate and assistant professors were alumni, but 52.4 per cent of instructors were appointed from
                    alumni during the years 1885-1937 indicates co-existence of two quite different policies.
                    Professorial appointments of alumni were made conservatively and only after most thoughtful
                    consideration during all four administrations. Instructors, on the contrary, were appointed rather
                    freely, but their promotion was made difficult.</p>
            <p>The directors cited in the above chart were not members of the faculty, for the act approved June 7,
                    1852, provided that "The President, Professors and Instructors shall be styled 'The Faculty' of said
                    university." There were, however, a few exceptions in which, in addition to the title as
                    director or executive, the individual also had a professorial title carrying faculty membership.</p>
            <p>Of these thirty-four executives, twenty, that is, 58.8 per cent were alumni. Known efficiency of the
                    appointee was the sole consideration involved in making these appointments. Of these thirty-four
                    appointees, twenty-five were major directors or executives and are included in Table 5 with heads
                    and deans. Nine were minor directors and appear here only.</p>
            <p>The largest number of appointments was included in the group of instructors. According to President
                    Bryan, the procedure and responsibility for these appointments did not rest primarily with the
                    president.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>The initial suggestion and recommendation of those appointed as instructors came in nearly all
                        cases, not from the president but from heads of departments to the president, and through him to
                        the trustees.</p>

                    <p>Whatever motives influenced heads in their recommendations, a chief motive must have been the
                        securing of satisfactory assistance.</p>
                </quote>
            <p>Recommendations of department heads in many instances were made under the emergency of unexpectedly
                    large enrollments in certain departments, as will be shown later. Distribution of this group as to
                    numbers and percentage of alumni and non-alumni is shown in Table 2. The later history of these
                    appointees shown elsewhere in this report indicates that these appointments, whether alumni or
                    nonalumni, were generally justified or of short duration.</p>
            <p>President Bryan also stated, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The initial suggestion and recommendation of those appointed as assistant or associate
                            professors came usually from heads of departments. These appointments were well considered
                            in each case by the head concerned and the president, and then by the trustees.</p>
                    </quote> Of this group 142 persons, or 79.3 per cent, were non-alumni and 37, or 20.7 per cent, were
                    alumni.</p>
            <p>"The President had primary official responsibility in recommending to the trustees those who
                    entered the university as professors or deans." Of this group 23 persons, or 21.5 per cent,
                    were alumni and 84 persons, or 78.5 per cent, were non-alumni.</p>
            <p>The number of instructors was so large that this class of appointees deserve further study to
                    determine what became of them. The following table presents the important facts about their

                    these fifty-two years was somewhat the stronger.</p>
            <p>The largest group of short-term instructors of Indiana University had non-academic careers. There

                    early death. The remainder are found as businessmen, chaplains, directors of various departments and
                    enterprises, editors, judges, lawyers, physicians, surgeons, superintendents of city schools, heads
                    of departments in city schools, research specialists in various fields, employees in various

                    superior ability as a teacher, or as an investigator in some independent field, not a mere rehash of
                    the doctorate thesis, or performance of some service important to the University and the
                    commonwealth, have been fairly consistently required as a basis of promotion.</p>
            <p>It will add interest and understanding to study further the 126 appointees who became heads of
                    departments, deans, or major non-teaching executives during the years 1885-1937. Among these, 37 who
                    became department heads or deans and 12 who became executives were alumni, while 64 department heads
                    or deans and 13 executives were non-alumni.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Department heads and deans numbered
                    101, and non-teaching executives numbered 25.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> See Table 5.</p>
            <p>Of these heads or deans, according to Table 5, <placeName>

                    </placeName> appointed 12 alumni and 11 non-alumni, a total of 23; Coulter appointed 5 alumni and 6
                    non-alumni, a total of 11; Swain appointed 6 alumni and 14 non-alumni, a total of 20; and Bryan
                    appointed 14 alumni and 33 non-alumni, a total of 47. <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Attention should again be directed to the definition of an alumnus
                            of Indiana University as one holding a baccalaureate or any other degree from the University
                            (note 1, above). In cases in which the appointment and the conferring of the degree were
                            close in point of time, decision has been made as to status of appointee at the time of
                            beginning of service. Consider as an illustration the case of John C. Branner (see below, p.
                            16), who was appointed by <placeName>
                                <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                            </placeName>. He was appointed professor of geology and instructor in botany, June 6, 1885,
                            and a little later in the same session the trustees voted him the degree of Doctor of
                            Philosophy. But since his appointment was to begin August 1, 1885, he is classed as an
                            alumnus. The case of Joseph P. Naylor is only slightly different. Trustee records show the
                            degree Master of Science was voted, June 6, 1885. On June 8, 1885, he was elected associate
                            professor of physics. Since neither Branner nor Naylor had been students at Indiana
                            University, it could be argued that place of training would have been a better basis of
                            classification. This was considered, but difficulties were multiplied. Many appointees had
                            done undergraduate and part of their graduate work at another university and, in some
                            instances, just enough of the final part of graduate work at Indiana University to qualify
                            for the degree. Assessing major training in such cases involves knowledge, not merely of
                            length of residence, but of work done at Indiana University and elsewhere; knowledge of the
                            strength of the department of the other institution in which the appointee had studied, etc.
                            We believe that classification in accordance with this definition of an alumnus as stated
                            weights the alumni rather than the non-alumni group.</item>

               </table> It will be noted that within this group of major leaders, alumni constituted 52 per cent of
                    Jordan's appointees (12 of 23), 45 per cent of Coulter's appointees (5 of 11), 30
                    per cent of Swain's appointees (6 of 20), and 30 per cent of Bryan's appointees
                    (14 of 47).</p>
            <p>It is of further interest to break down the alumni and non-alumni groups of each administration into
                    smaller groups in which each man is placed in the faculty rank of his initial faculty appointment.
                    The result is shown in the four following tables.</p>

               </table> of alumni in the different professorial ranks varies without regard to any pattern as
                    follows: professors, 22 per cent alumni; associate professors, 9 per cent; and assistant professors,
                    25 per cent.</p>
            <p>If, during the fifty-two years of these four administrations, alumni were recipients of special
                    consideration, it should appear in connection with these 101 most important appointments to the
                    faculty of Indiana University. Alumni constituted 78.6 per cent of the 28 instructors promoted
                    through the years to headship; 78 per cent of the 54 persons appointed directly to headships were
                    non-alumni. The findings cancel. The fact that 78.6 per cent of those instructors who later won
                    headships were alumni shows that these four administrations may have had a better evaluation of the
                    ability of alumni than of non-alumni instructors.</p>
            <p>The large majority of these 37 alumni heads and deans enjoyed the broadening influence of some years'
                    contact with other universities. This is presented in Table 11.</p>
            <p>It will be noted that seven European universities, six Eastern universities, and three Midwestern
                    universities provided the graduate training of this group. Only six had the doctor's degree
                    from Indiana University. Two of these, Frank Forry and Thurman B. Rice, received the degree of
                    Doctor of Medicine and in time became heads of departments in the sophomore year of the School of
                    Medicine. John C. Branner, Clarence E. Edmondson, Carl H. Eigenmann, and Charles H. Gilbert received
                    the Ph.D. degree at Indiana University.</p>
            <p>Branner had never been a student at Indiana University. His Ph.D. was his only degree and that was
                    honorary, though <pb n="143" id="VAA4025-040-2-043"/>

            <p>Edmondson and Eigenmann had all their formal academic training at Indiana University where Edmondson
                    became Dean of Men, and Eigenmann, organizer and Dean of the Graduate School. Eigenmann's
                    work is so well known that no comment is needed.</p>
            <p>Edmondson's work is less well understood. Bryan was a member of the faculty when the faculty
                    as a whole considered cases of student discipline, heard evidence, interrogated witnesses and
                    accused, and passed judgment. As enrollments grew and the faculty increased in number, this function
                    was gradually taken over by a committee on student affairs. In the early part of the Bryan
                    administration, Judge Enoch G. Hogate was chairman of this committee. He was succeeded by Dean
                    William A. Rawles. Faculty meetings were held at frequent intervals, sometimes every two weeks, when
                    most of the time, as shown by faculty minutes, was taken up by reports of the student affairs
                    committee. These reports were discussed by the faculty and generally approved.</p>
            <p>This time-wasting procedure was followed by appointment of Edmondson and Charles J. Sembower as deans
                    of men. These deans acted so quietly it might have been thought they did nothing. But if information
                    about any student was wanted, the card files in their office yielded surprising details. They
                    handled many difficult situations with great tact, and under their efficient management, student
                    discipline reached a new high at Indiana University.</p>

                    master's degree from Indiana University. He left the institution in 1891 for DePauw where
                    for 32 years he was professor of physics. The non-alumni appointees of this group of deans and
                    department heads enjoyed great diversity of training. This is shown graphically and in detail in

                    although the appropriations did not keep pace with the need for additional teachers and so became
                    increasingly inadequate. There was a state of almost continuous emergency, failure to consider which
                    would be as unfair as it would be today to fail to consider the war emergency in which an instructor
                    in philosophy and a housewife of some years become teachers of mathematics.</p>

               </table> It will be noted that there was an acceleration in the average annual increase in
                    enrollment up to 1923. Due to the great increase in the number of matriculants, an unexpectedly
                    large enrollment in a number of departments at the opening of nearly every year constituted an
                    emergency calling for <pb n="147" id="VAA4025-040-2-047"/> relief. This emergency was met in 52 per
                    cent of the cases by appointment of some recent graduate, available on short notice, as instructor.
                    We call attention to the special study of 576 instructors, showing that appointments of 60 per cent
                    of the instructors were temporary and that advancement to professorial rank was difficult.</p>
            <p>During those fifty-two years of most rapid increase in enrollment, the increase in budget was not
                    commensurate with the increase in teaching load. The report of the Committee on Finance, made under
                    date of January 3, 1885, estimated the income for 1884-1885 at $56,676. With a budget of
                    this size, Bryan was offered an instructorship in the fall of 1884 for the year at $250
                    which he declined. In June, 1885, he was made associate professor at a salary of $1,000. <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>'s salary for 1884-1885 had been $1,800.</p>
            <p>The inadequacy of state support of the University is further indicated by the fact that when the fire
                    of 1883 destroyed the main university building, the legislature voted a paltry $15,000
                    for its rebuilding. It was not until 1895 that one-sixth of a mill tax was imposed by the
                    legislature for support of Indiana University, Purdue University, and Indiana State Normal. By the
                    close of the school year 1900-1901, the enrollment had doubled three times since January 1, 1885,
                    while the university income had a little more than doubled. In the year 1884-1885 the budget of
                    $56,676, though small, was in excess of $500 per student. The budget of
                    1901-1902, $129,000, was slightly in excess of $100 per student. When
                    confronted by the necessity of appointing an emergency instructor, a better alumnus than non-alumnus
                    could usually be secured for the small salary available.</p>
            <p>The rapid growth in enrollment referred to above was a cause of great alarm to the many good people
                    whose chief higher educational interest centered in the denominational schools. They believed this
                    growth of the state university was a threat to the very existence of the non-state schools. During
                    the legislative session of 1897, the alarm and hostility developed into unified opposition, with a
                    senate hearing, directed toward the defeat of the Geeting Bill. Even so recently as 1909, Governor
                    Thomas R. Marshall (1909-1913) voiced a disappearing point of view, saying, "Who would pay
                    money at a denominational college for an education he could get free at a state
                    university?"</p>
            <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-040-2-048"/>
            <p>The statesmanlike answer to this inquiry was made by President Francis J. McConnell of DePauw, later
                    Bishop McConnell, who said, "So far as DePauw University is concerned, DePauw will be glad
                    to see more liberal appropriations voted the State Educational Institutions, for the more liberal
                    support of the state university makes it easier to get the more generous support needed by
                    DePauw." Ably supported by President Robert L. Kelly of Earlham, this was voted as the
                    sentiment of the non-state schools.</p>
            <p>With the waning of this opposition, the mill tax was increased and though Indiana has never been as
                    generous as some neighboring states in support of higher education, state appropriations did
                    improve. The dissipation of non-state school misapprehension and opposition was one of the finest
                    fruits of the tactful and ever friendly attitude of the Bryan administration. We believe that, in
                    any effort to evaluate the policy introduced by <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>, the peculiar difficulties of the period as sketched briefly above should be
                    considered.</p>
            <p>On May 31, 1940, the trustees of Indiana University adopted a resolution relating to "Employment of
                    Personnel." The resolution is too long to be included here. It applied to all members of
                    the instructional and administrative staff. It included the Extension Division and applied to all
                    persons employed on the mechanical or labor staff. Briefly stated, the resolution provided that any
                    persons to be employed by Indiana University must first present satisfactory evidence that he is not
                    closely related to any person already employed there.</p>
            <p>The last three paragraphs of the resolution read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>5. No person shall be employed without the submission of satisfactory evidence showing that
                            the person proposed to be employed is not related by blood or marriage to persons already
                            employed by Indiana University or to members of the State Board of Education or to Trustees
                            of Indiana University. The degrees of relationship covered by the above restriction are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>By blood: child-parent, brother-sister, uncle-aunt, nephew-niece; By marriage: husband-wife,
                            brother-in-law and sister-in-law, father-in-law and mother-in-law, son-in-law and
                            daughter-in-law, child and step-parent.</p>
                        <p>6. In case of the marriage of persons employed, one of the affected shall not be re-employed
                            at the beginning of the next fiscal year. <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-040-2-049"/> This
                            regulation is a condition to each contract of employment made subsequent to the effective
                            date of these regulations (May 31, 1940).</p>
                        <p>7. These regulations shall not affect the status of any one employed or who has been
                            appointed on or before the effective date of these regulations (May 31, 1940).</p>

            <p>It is obvious from the above that the trustees were concerned about close relationships. Cousins and
                    more distant relatives did not come under these rules.</p>
            <p>A study was made to ascertain what previous appointments had been made that would have been prevented

                                    University, 1824-1937, we have proceeded as follows: <p>We started with a complete
                                        list of faculty appointees, 1824-1937. Miss Ivy L. Chamness of the Department of
                                        Publications; Mrs. John Cravens, who did the painstaking work of compiling
                                        bibliographical data relating to each faculty member; and Miss Ruth McNutt, who
                                        was for many years secretary to President Bryan and kept the faculty list up to
                                        date following 1936, when Mrs. Cravens' work was completed, checked every person
                                        in the list who was known to be or thought to be in any way related to any other
                                        faculty member, administrative officer, or trustee. The list was then checked by
                                        President Bryan and by Dean H. L. Smith, both of whom have lived in <placeName>
                                            <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                                        </placeName> all their lives, and by Professor William J. Moenkhaus, appointed
                                        under the Swain administration in 1894. Instances of supposed relationship were
                                        carefully checked by contacting the ii-.dlvidu'.ils or their relatives. Likeness
                                        of name does not mean family icO.aticmhip. For instance, Professor R. R. Ramsey
                                        and Earl E. Ramscv, at one time principal of <placeName>
                                            <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                                        </placeName> High School, are not related in any known degree. The Barbours,
                                        Elizabeth and Humphrey, were not related despite the identical spelling of the
                                        family name.</p>
                                    <p>Carelessness in checking facts of relationship can lead to great error. As an
                                        illustration, Lillian Gay Berry (1902-1943) was the sister of Burton Bowers
                                        Berry, (1893-1894). Her appointment followed that of her brother after an
                                        interval of eight years. Merely stating the fact of relationship, though
                                        truthful, may still lead to a very false impression. The period of employment of
                                        all related persons was, therefore, painstakingly ascertained in order to
                                        determine if appointments were concurrent.</p>
                                    <p>
                              <hi rend="sup">5</hi> These fifty-four related persons whose appointments were
                                        not concurrent were, of course, not counted. We also eliminated eight cases in
                                        which there was likeness of name of unrelated persons. Dr. Moenkhaus was not
                                        related to Ernest W. Rettger at the time their appointments were concurrent.</p>

                    </quote>There were 104 persons, one in ten, related in the degree covered by the resolution of the
                    Board of Trustees. If the resolution of the Board had been limited to parent-child, brother-sister,
                    husband-wife, brother- or sister-in-law, it would have applied to 94 per cent of cases they
                    included. If the resolution had included all degrees of relationship up to and including second
                    cousins by marriage, it would have applied to only eighteen additional persons in 113 years.</p>
            <p>One should not leave this subject without stating that in the most frequent faculty relationship,
                    husband and wife, the wife in most instances proved eminently fitted for and adapted to the work for
                    which she was appointed. For the greater part, the child-parent and brother-sister appointments were
                    of brief duration. In a few instances in which the appointments extended over a considerable period
                    of years, contemporary faculty members knew a very worthwhile service was being demanded and
                    rendered.</p>
            <p>In this study of related faculty members nepotism has not been discussed. Instances could be cited in
                    most universities in which brothers, or parent and child, or husband and wife have been concurrent
                    faculty members of different departments of the same university. This is not nepotism. The
                    appointive body is a Board of Trustees, unrelated to appointees. In the 113 years covered by this
                    study, there have been remarkably few cases of nepotism.</p>
            <p>Considering first the Board of Trustees, a careful check shows no close relationship between
                    appointees and a member of the Board of Trustees with two exceptions, as follows:</p>
            <p>Sarah Parke Morrison, the daughter of John I. Morrison, trustee, had established a precedent by
                    becoming the first woman graduate of Indiana University (1869). Four years later she became a member
                    of the teaching staff for two years, the first year with the title of tutor, the second year with
                    the title of adjunct professor of English literature. During <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-040-2-051"/>
                    these two years she was also adviser to women. Thus she was the first woman member of the faculty,
                    which established a second precedent. Her period of service was short and there was probably a
                    feministic element in the appointment. Prior to becoming a student at Indiana University, Sarah
                    Morrison had graduated at Mount Holyoke, had been a pupil-teacher at Vassar, had graduated from a
                    business college, had been assistant principal" at Glendale and had taught in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> Western Female Seminary.</p>
            <p>In 1899 the administration was in search of a man as keeper of grounds. A person with the knowledge,
                    experience, and judgment desirable had not been found. R. A. Ogg, trustee, said, "I do not
                    like to suggest my brother, but he knows all about doing what we are needing here." So
                    William R. Ogg was appointed and continued to render valuable service for many years after his
                    brother's trusteeship terminated. It was a fortunate appointment.</p>
            <p>Within the administration we note the fact that President Andrew Wylie and his cousin Theophilus were
                    for fourteen years concurrent members of Indiana University's faculty. Andrew Wylie became
                    president of Indiana University in 1829 and served until his death in 1851. Theophilus Wylie became
                    pro tern professor of natural science and chemistry in 1837. The following year his appointment was
                    made permanent. He resigned in 1852 to accept a position at Miami University. On April 3, 1855, by
                    unanimous action of the trustees, he was re-elected professor of chemistry and natural philosophy at
                    Indiana University. He accepted and served until June 7, 1886, when he resigned and became professor
                    emeritus. He was a man of many-sided scholarship. Bringing him back to the University after an
                    absence of two and onehalf years, for thirty-one years' additional service, is ample evidence of the
                    wisdom of his original appointment.</p>
            <p>Within the faculty there are a few cases of seeming nepotism. What are the facts? John
                    Foley had been appointed and was serving as electrician for the campus. His work occasionally
                    overlapped that of the man in charge of building maintenance, and there were occasional clashes
                    between them. Both were good men. The president solved the problem of clashing personalities by
                    assigning John Foley as technician in the rapidly expanding Department of Physics headed by
                    Professor Arthur Foley, John's brother. For some <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-040-2-052"/> years
                    Myrtle Stempel taught in the Department of Comparative Philology, which was heade'd by her husband
                    whose hearing was failing. He might have had to be replaced at any time.</p>
            <p>Previous to 1885, there were six presidents of whom William Daily was an alumnus of Indiana
                    University. Presidents, as such, have not been included in any count of the faculty. Alfred Ryors is
                    included, having been professor of mathematics, 1844-1858, prior to becoming president. Bryan is
                    included since his appointment as instructor was effective as of January 1, 1885. He served
                    seventeen years as a faculty member, to June, 1902.</p>
            <p>When <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> was elected president of Indiana University, there were forty-seven applicants for the
                    position. In 1884 it was not considered a breach of good form to apply for this position.</p>
            <p>Coulter, of course, was never a student or member of the faculty at Indiana University. The minutes
                    of the Board of Trustees show that John M. Coulter was elected professor of botany and geology on
                    April 14, 1885. He evidently refused the appointment, for on June 6, 1885, Branner was elected
                    professor of geology and instructor in botany. The Ph.D., which was granted Coulter in June, 1884,
                    the minutes of the Board of Trustees indicate to have been "pro merito." During his brief
                    stay of two years at Indiana University, Coulter had to make a comparatively large number of
                    appointments because of the fact that <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> had taken with him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> six men from the faculty he had built up at Indiana University, five of them department
                    heads.</p>
            <p>Coulter was never a member of the so-called "Specialist's Club," nor was Swain.
                    James A. Woodburn gave the membership of this club as "<placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>, its organizer, representing biology; Charles H. Gilbert, zoology; Horace A. Hoffman,
                    Greek; William Lowe Bryan, philosophy; Rufus Green, mathematics; and James A. Woodburn,
                    history." Bryan and Hoffman, members still living, have been consulted without adding to
                    this list. The purpose of the club was not the meeting of specialists but the stimulation of young
                    men to become specialists. It fitted in with <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>'s idea of selecting superior alumni and sending them away to qualify for their
                    speciality. An instance of this was the appointment of Swain <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-040-2-053"/> as
                    associate professor of mathematics, and according to the minutes of the Board of Trustees, a grant
                    of a year's leave of absence "to qualify for mathematics work." As the mission of
                    this very informal club was fulfilled, <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>'s catholic interest was transferred to other matters and the club faded out. <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> was no doubt influential in the appointments of Coulter and Swain, neither of whom, as
                    Woodburn tells us, were members of the "Specialist's Club."</p>
            <p>The election of Bryan as revealed by the records occurred in the following manner: President Swain
                    had been offered the presidency of Swathmore, his church college. There were reasons why he wished
                    to accept and other reasons why he desired to stay at Indiana University. He was much perplexed as
                    to what he should do. In his report to the Board of Trustees, June 17, 1902, he informed the Board
                    of his invitation. He stated he had stipulated certain conditions of acceptance which Swathmore had
                    met, and he presented his written resignation. The Board had convened at 10:30. They received,
                    considered, and regretfully accepted the resignation of President Swain. They then took up the
                    consideration of a successor. Before nominations were made, it was suggested a trial ballot be
                    taken. It was proposed that each member should write on his ballot the name of the man who was his
                    first choice for the presidency. These ballots were collected, and it was discovered all bore the
                    name of William Lowe Bryan. Dr. Bryan was called before the Board, notified of his election, made a
                    speech of acceptance conditioned on his health, then not good, being such that he could carry the
                    load, and at 1:30 the Board adjourned. In one sitting, three hours, the Board of Trustees had
                    received and accepted the resignation of one president and elected a successor, a good
                    morning's work.</p>

                    </placeName> deliberately started at Indiana University what generally has been called inbreeding, a
                    term adopted from the biologists. But it must be noted that <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in his autobiographical sketch in the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Star,</hi> was not talking of promiscuous inbreeding which has given rise to the
                    deduction that all inbreeding led inevitably to degeneration, but of selective inbreeding by which
                    the best qualities of a strain are emphasized and perpetuated.</p>

               <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Coulter, Swain, and Bryan were searching for <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-040-2-054"/> men
                    of superior ability and had the keenness to recognize and the courage to develop them, even if found
                    on their own campus. Adaptability was a factor of great importance in the selection of new faculty
                    members, but adaptability was not a quality confined to alumni. Some of the most adaptable men were
                    found among the non-alumni appointees, while the greatest opposition to the initiation of a program
                    for making Indiana University a university in fact was encountered in some ultraconservative alumni
                    faculty members. It was not expected, of course, that the appointee would be complacent on
                    encountering inadequate facilities. It was hoped that he would grasp the vision and share the
                    conviction bordering on certainty, that in time conditions at Indiana would be made adequate and
                    that it was going to be worthwhile to help bring about that better day.</p>
            <p>Seventy-four alumni of Indiana University have been called to some normal school, college, or
                    university as president. Of these seventy-four, sixty earned the baccalaureate degree at Indiana
                    University. The other fourteen earned other degrees at Indiana University. Boards of trustees of
                    these widely distributed institutions have recognized these individuals as men of superior ability
                    and attainment by selecting them for the high office of president. Since Indiana men have received
                    this recognition from seventy-four groups of trustees throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, would not the trustees of Indiana University have been unpardonably shortsighted if
                    some of the best of the graduates of Indiana University had not been retained as long as possible as
                    faculty members?</p>
            <p>After an absence of many years, <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> pointed with pride to the establishment of this procedure as one of the best things he
                    did while in Indiana and expressed the conviction that to it was due "a large part of the
                    educational progress of Indiana University."</p>
            <p>The fact that, except for the daughter of a trustee appointed to the faculty of Indiana University,
                    1873-1875, no other one of the hundreds of persons who have served on the faculty of Indiana
                    University from 1820 to 1937 has been closely related to any one of the 160 persons who have been
                    members of the Board of Trustees constitutes an imperishable record of the unselfish devotion of the
                    Board to the interests committed to its care. Data such as is available for the faculty is not
                    complete for appointees other than faculty <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-040-2-055"/> members. So far as
                    available, the record of the Board in connection with this large group of non-faculty employees is
                    equally enviable.</p>
            <p>The story here related conforms to type for the development of an old culture, such as art,
                    literature, or education, in a new territory. The culture was first imported, but bringing it to
                    America did not make it American. It was still European culture only transplanted, and it remained
                    so for half a century or more until a new generation began to write stories and paint pictures. Some
                    of these new Americans went across the water to learn what Europe had to teach of art and
                    literature, and came back to write and draw. People liked what they wrote and painted and finally
                    even Europe said it was good, and so we knew it was good. We bought the stories and books and paid
                    the artist for his painting, and the author and artist paid the grocer, and a culture was
                    established in new territory on a living basis.</p>
            <p>Essentially this process was repeated when education was carried across the mountains to a new
                    frontier in the great Northwest Territory, a territory larger than <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, a territory in which education was subsidized in township and state by federal land
                    grants. During the first sixty years only a few graduates of the state school succeeded in
                    establishing themselves in the field of university education. But with the election of <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> came the dawn of that new period when the transplanting process was completed and
                    education had taken root in the new soil.</p>

            <p>Two committees active for a number of years have collected so many pictures and data covering their
                    subjects of early water-power mills and covered timber bridges that preparations for publication can
                    be undertaken. Water-power mills played a central part in the development of Indiana from the
                    earliest time to the middle of the nineteenth century. Their decline and disappearance from most
                    parts of the state form an illuminating chapter in the history of industry in the last hundred
                    years. Covered timber bridges afforded the first satisfactory means of carrying travel and traffic
                    over the streams, both large and small, of the state. They were the most conspicuous man-made
                    features of the Indiana landscape in the last half of the nineteenth century. The steel and concrete
                    bridges which have replaced them, though stronger and better fitted to support the heavy traffic of
                    the present time, do not erase from memory either the service or the sentimental appeal of the old
                    covered timber bridges.</p>
            <p>The material collected in the William Henry Smith Memorial Library could be the basis of valuable and
                    handsome volumes upon early mills and covered timber bridges in the state. A fitting book on either
                    subject is beyond the present resources of the Society. A quiet effort is being made, however, to
                    secure necessary funds.</p>

                    report upon the Angel mounds and village sites upon which Glenn A. Black, field director of
                    archaeology for the Historical Society, has been working since the spring of 1939. For nearly three
                    years, Mr. Black <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-040-2-057"/> was assisted by a varying number of Work

                    artifacts uncovered during the operation of the WPA archaeological project and discoveries about the
                    prehistoric inhabitants of the site. Mr. Black's report will be somewhat in the nature of a
                    summary of the process and the results of the project. No announcement can be made at this time of

            <head>THE LETTERS OF GODLOVE S. ORTH, RADICAL REPUBLICAN</head>
            <byline>Edited by J. HERMAN SCHAUINGER</byline>
            <p>This third group of Orth letters covers a period of twenty-one years, 1860-1881, during which time
                    the government of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> met and conquered its greatest domestic crisis. The country was ruled for a time by an
                    extra-constitutional committee, which set up military governments to rule part of the nation for the
                    only time in our history. A small group of Radical leaders freed the slaves, revolutionized the
                    economic life of the old masters of that race, and, by fanning the fires of sectional hatred,
                    managed to control the affairs of the nation for some time. Drunk with power obtained by these
                    means, politicians blackened the pages of our history with an orgy of political corruption and
                    disgrace, climaxed by the unsuccessful move to oust an honest president.</p>
            <p>During these twenty years, Orth remained on the national political scene, most of the time in
                    Congress. In 1861, despite his skepticism, Governor Morton appointed him one of the five Indiana
                    representatives to the Peace Conference in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In July, 1862, he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a captain of volunteers, but with the danger of invasion over, he was mustered out
                    in August.</p>
            <p>In the same year he was elected to the Thirty-eighth Congress and served continuously through the
                    Forty-first Congress. During this time he constantly urged a determined prosecution of the war. When
                    he became convinced that President Johnson would not compromise with Congress, he joined the camp of
                    the Radicals and constantly supported all Radical reconstruction measures, voting for the Thirteenth
                    and Fourteenth amendments.</p>
            <p>He took an active interest in the foreign policy of the government, especially in making certain
                    changes in the diplomatic and consular services. He favored the annexation of Santo Domingo but in
                    1868 opposed the recognition of Cuban belligerency. He did not serve in the Forty-second Congress
                    but reappeared in the Forty-third. In 1872 he indicated a desire for a foreign post; in 1875 he
                    declined the ministership to <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName> but accepted the office of Minister to <placeName>
                  <country reg="au">Austria</country>-<country reg="hu">Hungary</country>
               </placeName>. <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-040-2-059"/> In May of the following year he resigned this position to accept the
                    gubernatorial nomination of his party in Indiana but withdrew from the race. In 1878 and 1880 he was
                    again in Congress.</p>
            <p>The following letters are more significant in their omissions than content and are less exciting and
                    valuable than those of the Whig period. They are almost entirely concerned with his personal
                    political affairs and problems of patronage, with little discussion of the great national problems.
                    There are but five written during the course of the war, and no mention is made of the exciting
                    events of the Radical contest against Johnson. No hint is given of the devastation caused by the
                    exposure of the scandals of the Grant administration, although the recipient of many of these
                    letters, Vice-President Colfax, was practically forced from public life because of the Credit
                    Mobilier scandal. There are other noticeable gaps. These letters, however, reveal something of what
                    went on behind the scene of Indiana politics. The very evident gaps in the dates of the letters to
                    Colfax make it probable that there were other letters to him; it may be hoped that these will some
                    day come to light. Orth was not a great man, but he was in the thick of political events for a long
                    period. He was a voluminous letter writer and there can be little doubt that many more of his
                    letters survive.</p>

                        <p>I wrote you yesterday rather hurriedly, in reference to the appointment of Cadet.</p>
                        <p>I think I used the word "clandestinely" in speaking of Mr. White's
                                    recommendation, and if so, I feel I did him a injustice, which I would not do
                                    Knowingly to any one.</p>
                        <p>It may be his right to make the nomination, but the matter has been Kept so quiet
                                    about [?] that I <hi rend="i">suspect</hi> there may be some doubt as to
                                    his right, but that his nomination would be respected in the absence of any from me.
                                    All I want is the exercise of my own undoubted privilege and if under the

                                    however was called, and the <hi rend="i">people</hi> by an unanimous and
                                    enthusiastic vote renominated me. Those who opposed me saw the coming of the storm
                                    and like prudent sagacious men they preferred not to breast it any longer.</p>
                        <p>Suffice it to say that the people had looked upon my re-nomination as a matter of
                                    course-and being busy in their fields &amp; shops gave themselves no concern,
                                    until I returned and got a few of my friends to sound the alarm. <placeName>

                                    they will work with a will, and are not by any means despondent.</p>
                        <p>Several (Johnson,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Chenowith, Ash &amp;c) requested me to say
                                    to you, that you should not bear a joint campaign with Turpie, and gave as a reason
                                    the manner he treated you before, and the fear of undue excitement in the District.
                                    I merely comply with their request, Knowing that in this matter you are your own

                        <salute>Friend Pratt,</salute>
                        <p>Your favor is reed, and I note what you say upon the ticklish subject of taxation.</p>
                        <p>There is a Bill before the proper Com. to carry out your suggestions, but I doubt
                                    whether it will be acted on at all during the few days of the Session yet remaining.</p>
                        <p>It is very doubtful however whether in view of our past legislation in reference to
                                    all our National Legislation, we should not be guilty of bad faith in attempting to
                                    tax any portion.</p>
                        <p>The contest this fall all over the country is assuming vast and important
                                    proportions, and the issues involved are not second in importance to any ever
                                    presented to the American People- Their [?] will be put to a severe test,
                                    but I have great confidence in the result, and if the action of Congress should be
                                    sustained, the country will be saved from the dangers which threaten it- Should the
                                    contrary be the result I much fear that untold trials and disasters are in store for

                        <p>On my return from Delphi last night, whither I had been to address the Old Settlers
                                    meeting, I reed your note enclosing letter of Goddard.</p>
                        <p>I cannot say that I am surprised at T's course-for since you &amp; I
                                    interceded in his behalf with McPherson<hi rend="sup">10</hi> I learned so much of
                                    his character, or rather want of character, as to be prepared for anything from that
                                    quarter. I am much more surprised that the Journal should lend itself to a
                                    promulgation of his meanness-but I suppose that all who do not worship continually
                                    at the shrine of a certain "M-ogul" of our state, are to have his dogs barking at
                                    their heels.</p>
                        <p>You know how they have served me heretofore in this District.</p>
                        <p>As to Thompson,<hi rend="sup">11</hi> I have for the last 18 Mos kept Him at arms
                                    length, and of course shall expect from him similar treatment to that which you are
                                    receiving when the proper time arrives.</p>
                        <p>But my dear Sir, you must expect these things for the boys always throw stones at the

                        <p>My district is very close and I have a hard contest on hand.</p>
                        <p>Our friends have decided on a rally here on Thursday the 1st of. Octo. and on its
                                    success depends very much the success in Octo.</p>
                        <p>Senator Sherman<hi rend="sup">16</hi> has promised to do the <hi rend="i">talking</hi> for the occasion, but if Genl. Grant could favor us with his <hi rend="i">personal presence</hi> we could arouse an enthusiasm that would shelf
                                    all opposition.</p>
                        <p>By this days mail I wrote to the Genl. requesting his attendance, and I hope it will
                                    meet his approval, and my object in writing to you is to have your good word added
                                    to the request-</p>
                        <p>I can see of no impropriety at all in his coming here on that day, and much good will

                        <p>I write you in that spirit of candor which should characterize a friendship of nearly
                                    thirty years standing, and will be pleased to hear from you in the same spirit, and
                                    to receive such suggestions as you may feel at liberty to make.</p>
                        <p>I know that you can do much among the Members elect from your district, and with that
                                    support I shall feel much encouraged in my effortsâ€¦ .</p>

                        <p>I proceed to answer several interrogations and here let me promise, that I shall at

                        <p>The 41st Congress will convene on the 4th of March next, and I Know of no reason why
                                    it should remain in session longer than a week or ten days. You will however most

                                    leading and influencial Republicans in each townshipthis list numbers about 100 to
                                    each County. The other embracing pretty much all the reading Republicans, and <hi rend="i">some Democrats,</hi> in the District. This list numbers about 10,000.</p>
                        <p>The first list I use for the distribution of Books, Pub. Docs, and occasionally a
                                    speech of some leading Member. The other list is used almost exclusively for the
                                    distribution of speeches and political pamphlets.</p>
                        <p>The former list it would be well for you to prepare in time for the opening of the

                        <p>Seats are selected by lot on the opening of each Congress and as much oftener as the
                                    House may order, which I have known to be done on two or three occasions during a
                                    session.</p>
                        <p>This, I believe, embraces all your enquiries-and now as to the Senatorship.</p>
                        <p>I certainly thank you for the most flattering opinion you express as to my fitness
                                    for the place. I have entered the Lists, with the full concurrance of every leading
                                    Republican in my District and I have reason to believe that every Republican Paper,
                                    and all the Republican Senators &amp; Reps, in the District will give me their
                                    hearty support.</p>
                        <p>This should be satisfactory, on that score at least, to other parts of the state.</p>
                        <p>In the event of my election to the Senate, there would not be any trouble about
                                    electing a Republican in my succession. And as I have fully determined upon making
                                    the race I shall feel under many obligations to have the support of at least a
                                    portion of the Delegation from your District.</p>
                        <p>Should I be successful I shall regret that fortune has placed us in different ends of
                                    the Capitol, but we shall nevertheless have abundant opportunity to recall &amp;
                                    recount many of the scenes &amp; incidents of Auld Lang Syneâ€¦ .</p>

                        <salute>My dear Colfax,</salute>
                        <p>I hardly know whether to withhold my congratulations until another most interesting
                                    event shall have been added to your history. We can however settle both when we meet
                                    at the Capitol.</p>
                        <p>I don't like to make suggestions especially when they are unasked -but many years ago
                                    you wrote advising that "a politician" should never hesitate or "look behind
                                    him."</p>
                        <p>I believe your chances to succeed Grant are at this time better than those of any
                                    living man.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To keep them in this condition will require the constant action of yourself &amp;
                                    friends.</p>
                        <p>It strikes me that the best thing now to be done, would be to have our old &amp;
                                    much esteemed friend Defrees placed at the head of the P. O. Dept.</p>
                        <p>He is well qualified for this position, but independent of all this there is
                                    something due to such a friendship as his has been for the last 30 yrs</p>
                        <p>I make these hurried suggestions on my <hi rend="i">own responsibility,</hi> and
                                    without the knowledge of anyone; nor shall I detain you by enlarging upon a matter
                                    which your own good judgment will grasp in all its leanings upon your

                        <p>I hope when the contest thickens, you will see your way clear to throw aside your
                                    neutrality-and buckle on the arms of righteousness for <hi rend="i">Godlove's</hi> sake. But of this anon.</p>
                        <p>As to Route Agencies I have not the time to give you full details as to the modus
                                    operandi-nor is it necessary until you get to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>.</p>
                        <p>About the 1st of March the Rep. Members from this State get together and divide this
                                    patronage among themselves, taking into consideration the number of Agents to be
                                    appointed-and the different routes running through any one District.</p>
                        <p>For instance the Valley Road runs. thro, the District, of Shanks,<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Williams,<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Pratt &amp; Orth-being 4. members and
                                    only 2 agents. This must be equalized by taking into consideration other lines of
                                    road, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>We will find it a very troublesome matter to adjust with exactitude. In the meantime
                                    I say to all my applicants "you must wait until I see how many agencies fall to my
                                    lot."â€¦</p>

                        <p>Your favor is recd. I am half inclined to send it to Mr. Lanman,<hi rend="sup">21</hi> and have him publish it as your Biography <hi rend="i">prior</hi> to your
                                    elevation to the National Councils-leaving the Addenda for future Editions.</p>
                        <p>But seriously-Lanman is entitled to much credit for his Dictionary. I shall not
                                    consider any political Library complete without it. He gives a very brief account
                                    (about a dozen lines) to each M.C. from the organization of the Govt, stating birth,
                                    education, residence, profession, and official Station-and then etc. etc. You must
                                    furnish him, remembering that with public honors come also private annoyances. Are
                                    you still in the field for Senator? If not, I wish you to enter full
                                    handed, either for yourself or me-I know you can do me good to the extent of at
                                    least half dozen votes, and if I have drawn my Senatorial horoscope correctly, that
                                    number will about help me out.</p>
                        <p>Hoping to have the pleasure of seeing you at Inds. next weekâ€¦ .</p>

                        <p>During the campaign of 1866 Wilson was one of the leading Johnson men in my District,

                                    appointed Post Master by said Johnson. He continued to act with the Democratic Party
                                    until confirmed by the Senate, since which time he has professed to act with the
                                    Republican party.</p>

                        <p>Your favor of yesterday is recd. Accept my thanks for the same.</p>
                        <p>Now as to the Delphi P. O. I am satisfied there are no <hi rend="i">substantial</hi>
                                    reasons for the removal of Major Hannum<hi rend="sup">28</hi>-that the clamor
                                    against him was raised and is kept up mainly by disappointed applicants and their
                                    friends. Should the Dept. however determine upon his removal and request you to
                                    suggest a successor it strikes me the best thing you can do is to consult with Mr.
                                    A. H. Bowen.</p>
                        <p>I have always found Mr. Bowen a safe, prudent, and sagacious counsellor in all such
                                    matters, but I hope there will be no change, at least not until after the election.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. O requests me to say that she would be very much pleased to have Mrs. Pratt pay
                                    her a visit at any time within the next two weeks, or about the first week in

                        <p>While at the P. O. Dept. this morning Mr. Marshall informed me that Major
                                    Hannum's removal as P.M at Delphi had been determined upon- At my
                                    suggestion the Dept. has agreed to accept his resignation, and by this mail I have
                                    written to Hannum to forward his resignation, at once, which he will doubtless do.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Pratt,</salute>
                        <p>Yours of yesterday is reed. I am aware that there are quite a number of clever
                                    gentlemen in our State who have a hankering for friend Park's position, but
                                    I have reason to believe that the administration does not desire any change.</p>
                        <p>A letter from Secy. Fish,31 now before me contains the following "Not being aware of
                                    any reason for a change in the incumbency of the Consulate at Aix la Chappie your
                                    desire for Mr. Park's retention will be all that is necessary to secure
                                    that result."</p>
                        <p>I have quoted as much of the Secretary's letter to me, to enable you to
                                    state to your Correspondents what seems to be the determinaion of the State Dept. in
                                    this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Park has no <hi rend="i">special claims</hi> for the position. He is one of the
                                    oldest and most faithful Republicans in the State, laboring at all times and under
                                    all circumstances for the success of our cause, giving his time and his money
                                    freely-never croaking, never complaining. His character is above reproach-he is in
                                    all respects a gentlemana classical scholar-a practical common sense man who never
                                    shrinks from the performance of duty-and he has discharged his official duties with
                                    singular fidelity and to the entire satisfaction of the President.</p>
                        <p>In view of civil service reform (now so much vaunted) he ought to be permitted to
                                    remain at his post if he desires it-but there are some queer things done in this
                                    world, and especially so at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, sometimes, but there is no telling what his fate may be.</p>
                        <p>I have long since schooled myself into the philosophy "to take the world as it

                        <p>Your note is recd. I almost envy you your "otium cum etc." Public service
                                    here is very tame in contrast with the exciting scenes through which you &amp; I
                                    passed, in the grand effort to save the Republic.</p>
                        <p>Not only have the scenes, changed, but the principal actors are nearly all gone-and
                                    new men <hi rend="i">attempt</hi> to occupy their places- Of those of the old
                                    regime, who remain, it might almost be said that "they lag superfluous on the
                                    stage."</p>
                        <p>I might say many things to you-if we were vis a vis, but shall not trust the
                                    uncertainties of a letter- Why did you not pay the Capitol, at least, a flying visit
                                    this Session? You have many friends here who speak kindly of past
                                    memories &amp; past services, but alas! also some enemies- Who amongst us is
                                    without themâ€¦ .</p>

                        <p>I hope that a few days rest and good nursing will bring you out all right.</p>
                        <p>You undertook too great a task, in the midst of the terribly heated term through
                                    which we have passed.</p>

                        <p>Rest assured that its good Kind words have left an impression not easily to be

                        <p>The public mind is not only fearfully sensitive on the subject of charges against
                                    public men-but for the last few years, many leading Republicans seemed more
                                    interested in seeing their associates, rather than their political opponents,
                                    injured and destroyed.</p>
                        <p>Am glad to hear of your peace &amp; prosperity, and sincerely hope it may
                                    continue to the endâ€¦ .</p>

                        <salute>My dear Schuyler,</salute>
                        <p>Please accept my thanks for the "[Ottoman?] Democrat," containing
                                    the Weaver interview, you so kindly sent me.</p>
                        <p>The "Contest" has given me little uneasiness. So far as I know, if they oust me, it
                                    will be through pure "cussedness" and those things usually recoil-</p>
                        <p>For many months I have endulged the hope of being able to meet you, but our paths do
                                    not seem to cross.</p>
                        <p>I have been wanting to say to you personally-what I shall now say on paper. You owe
                                    it to yourself-to your family-to your friends -to your party and to your Country to
                                    re-enter public life-either as our candidate for Governor, or M.C from your
                                    District.</p>
                        <p>We are on the ascending wave and to the Denis, it will be a tidal wave-and no more
                                    auspicious moment will ever greet you.</p>

                        <p>There is an assessment of $60. against him and I know that he has devoted
                                    more than a month of his time and spent twice that amount in our campaign. Under the

                        <salute>My dear Sir [Garfield] :-</salute>
                        <p>I notice that the question of an Extra Session of Congress is being discussed by the
                                    public Press.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment nothing but an urgent and unavoidable necessity would justify it.</p>
                        <p>Since my return from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> I have taken some pains to ascertain the drift of public sentiment in
                                    my District and other portions of the State, and with scarcely a dissenting opinion
                                    the sentiment is decidedly averse to an Extra Session. This is peculiarly the
                                    sentiment of our intelligent business men, whose response is- "give us a rest from
                                    political or financial excitement."</p>
                        <p>Should it be necessary Congress might be convened early in the fall, say about the
                                    middle of Octo. or 1st of Novemberâ€¦ .</p>

                    </placeName> with his father in 1828. He soon left for a short residence in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> his home. Here he continued his scientific studies under great handicaps, building and
                    equipping a remarkable laboratory and museum.</p>
            <p>In 1837 and 1838 the state of Indiana provided for a geological survey. Owen was appointed state
                    geologist and after tours of inspection and study, he prepared the first two reports on the geology
                    of the state.</p>
            <p>Congress in 1839 required information upon mineral deposits in order to prevent the sale of public
                    lands containing valuable mineral resources. Owen was appointed late in 1839 to make a survey of the
                    lead mining regions of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. From the survey were prepared maps, exhibits of specimens, and a report.
                    Owen's next task was to broaden his scientific knowledge, to become acquainted with other
                    geologists, and to win their confidence and respect. In doing these things, he achieved a reputation
                    as the leading geologist of the Middle West.</p>
            <p>Provisions were made in 1847 for opening the Chippewa Land District in northeastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> and Owen was employed to make a survey in order that the mineral land could be
                    distinguished from the non-mineral. The survey was broadened to include <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>, <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, and the <hi rend="i">Report</hi> attracted attention both at home and abroad. In the
                    last six years of his life he managed a survey for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, another for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, and under his direction, his brother Richard undertook a new survey for Indiana.
                    Overwork and hardships encountered in his field work brought death in 1860 to David Dale Owen. The
                    author concludes <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-040-2-080"/> that Owen's main contribution was the
                    determination and naming of the major geological formations of the <geogName>Mississippi
                    Valley</geogName>, placing them broadly in their relative positions in the geologic time scale and

            <p>Of the phases of American social history to 1860, Mrs. Tyler has taken two dominant trends as the
                    theme of her study: "Cults and Utopias" and "Humanitarian Crusades." In exposition
                    of the former topic, the author has dealt briefly with the religious life of colonial America, and
                    has developed at greater length the Utopian strivings of early nineteenth-century America. The very
                    obvious movements are discussed, such as transcendentalism, Brook Farm, Bronson Alcott and
                    Fruitlands, Mormonism, Shakerism, and <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and Jemima Wilkinson, the Universal Friend.</p>
            <p>In treating the latter subject, "Humanitarian Crusades," Mrs. Tyler has undertaken
                    to sketch the history of the antislavery movement and its culmination in the Civil War; early
                    nineteenth-century women's rights movement; the nationalistic, nativistic, anti-Roman
                    Catholic and anti-Masonic episodes in our nation's history; temperance; education; and
                    criminal and social reform. All have been treated with a facile pen, though the exposition
                    occasionally seems interlarded with quotations.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Tyler has the gift of writing well; her study can be criticized from one point of view, however,
                    as being too textbookish. It is on this comment that most reviewers would indulge in <hi rend="i">obiter dictum.</hi> Depending upon the reader's approach to the book, it will appear
                    as too lengthy for general exposition, too reliant upon secondary materials, and perhaps in part
                    even superfluous.</p>
            <p>The general reader will find in this book a good summation of the various "crack-pot" movements that
                    studded this period. It represents a mine of information within its limits, <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-040-2-081"/> but there are gaps. No mention is made of medical history, of the
                    mushroom growth of medical and eclectic colleges in reference to the history of American higher
                    education, nor of the development of American philosophy within the colleges and its bearing upon
                    the philosophical and religious life of the nation. These are seemingly serious omissions. The
                    stress, moreover, is upon the abnormal. No mention is made of the crusading zeal of the Protestant
                    circuit riders or of the early Roman priests and bishops on the frontier. Though the attitudes of
                    the churches on slavery are briefly discussed, it would have been a more complete picture had the
                    ecclesiastical background been depicted. The attitudes of the churches are perhaps best understood
                    in the light of historical perspective. It would have given a better setting for the abnormal and
                    aberrational in cultist development had a comparison with normal church growth been drawn.</p>
            <p>The specialist in early <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history will find this book disappointing; its possibilities are great, but its
                    realizations fall short of the ideal. Relying almost wholly on published material, Mrs. Tyler has
                    presented little not already available to the researcher. Her greatest contribution to the
                    specialist is perhaps her very extensive notes and bibliography.</p>
            <p>The student will approach this book as a boon. It should be required reading for every student
                    meeting American history for the first time in college. It will give the student a survey of those
                    fundamentals of faith, truth and half-truth to which our forebears often clung so tenaciously.
                    Dependent upon the reader's background and technical intellectual equipment, the approach
                    to this study will be eager, hesitant, or even reluctant. It offers much to the novice, but little
                    to the specialist, from the standpoint of depth of treatment.</p>
            <p>To all it offers a fine summation of the knowledge and facts in that field to which Mrs. Tyler has
                    limited herself, to "the religious movements and the adventures in reform of the early years of the
                    republic" which were the "truly significant activities of the men and women of the ageâ€¦

            <p>This volume describes the development of a Middle Western commonwealth in the last quarter of the
                    nineteenth century. Although the task of organizing and coordinating the various phases of life was
                    difficult, it was accomplished with much success. The work includes politics, agriculture,
                    transportation, city life, industry, and a conglomeration of material which is usually classified as
                    social history.</p>

                    </placeName>'s political history was unusually significant in this period for three of her
                    sons became President, while others achieved prominence of a somewhat lesser degree. It was
                    necessary to relate two stories in the chapters on politics, one delineating the state contests and
                    the other describing national developments, particularly those phases of special significance to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Agricultural activities are pictured, including crops, animals, improved methods,
                    machinery, the Grange, and other factors influencing the life of the farmer. The decline of the
                    canal system, the coming of the railroads, and the struggle for state regulation of railroad rates
                    are narrated in a chapter on transportation. The rise of industry and big business gave <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> such varied products as the cash register, farm machinery, iron and coal, and such
                    other results as the rise of urban centers, labor controversies, and the development of insurance
                    and fire prevention. The shame of city government is painted in a realistic manner under the title,
                    "Bosses and Boodle."</p>
            <p>A second chapter, "The Rise of the City," tells the story of the foreign born; of
                    the rise of fire, police, and health protection; and of the organizations devoted to charities,
                    religion, education, and sports. A third chapter on politics is divided between the election of
                    William McKinley to the presidency and the activities of Joseph B. Foraker, Mark Hanna, John
                    Sherman, and other leaders who endeavored to control the Republican party, win the elections, and
                    meet the popular demand for regulation of big business. They endeavored to do the latter without
                    injuring the corporations.</p>
            <p>The great variety of material included in the author's concept of history is indicated by
                    the last four chapters of this volume. They involve a description of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s development in respect to architecture, furniture, fashions, lodges, <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-040-2-083"/> fairs, and sports; the treatment of the sick, the unfortunate,
                    and the criminals; the habits of Ohioans in regard to reading and music; the development of schools
                    and colleges; the activities of a varied list of inventors and scientists; and, finally, the work of
                    a host of literary writers and artists.</p>
            <p>There are occasional statements in the volume which will be questioned. For example: "It was
                    well known that Grant was not a candidate for re-election [in 1876]â€¦" (p. 50);
                    "In 1879â€¦ the secretary of the treasury resumed specie payment, and the Nation again was
                    on a gold basis" (p. 152); and "The elections of 1878 were unimportant as only Congressmen were to
                    be voted uponâ€¦" Oddly enough, the campaign of 1896 is eloquently described but
                    without treating the People's party (pp. 322-23). The extent to which social history takes
                    the historian in his search of truth is revealed on pages 433-34 where the invention of artificial
                    fish bait is the subject of comment. In the discussion of disease and of medical advance, the use of
                    technical medical terms unknown to the laymen may encourage the tendency to lay the book aside
                    rather than to persevere to the end. All of these are, however, quite minor points.</p>
            <p>Excellent illustrations, some thirty in number, grace the narrative and make a contribution to the
                    reader. The work is well annotated and indexed but, like the other volumes of the series, lacks a
                    bibliography. Unfortunately, the author's name is misspelled on the outside cover. It is
                    quite obvious, however, that the defects are minor and of little importance and that the volume is a
                    significant addition to the historiography of <placeName>

            <p>These little volumes give interesting pictures of the nonmilitary history of the Confederacy. They
                    are timely volumes <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-040-2-084"/> which reveal how a portion of the people of
                    this country fared in a previous war, how they resisted the demoralizing developments which arose
                    during that long struggle, and how a brave people continued until defeat overcame them.</p>
            <p>The first of these is the result of the mature scholarship of a former leading authority on the
                    Confederacy. It treats the numerous problems which the government of the Confederate states failed
                    to solve and the effects of the failures upon the people at home. "It was inevitable that discontent
                    should be felt and voiced by those who suffered undue privations, especially when they saw their
                    children go without shoes, warm clothing, meat, and sometimes without bread [p. 45]."</p>
            <p>Public finance, the scarcity of necessities, high prices, speculation, lack of adequate
                    transportation facilities, the suffering of the poor, especially the women and children at home, all
                    led the Southern people to lose some of their faith in <hi rend="i">laissez faire</hi> and to demand
                    that their governments should act to bring relief. When successful remedies were not produced,
                    demoralization and desertion resulted. Governments strove to find remedies, even adopting measures
                    which were contrary to well-established practices and prejudices. The people of the South labored
                    manfully and devotedly against discouragements until their experiment in Southern nationalism
                    disintegrated before their eyes and they were overwhelmed by superior forces. Conditions on the home
                    front were fundamental causes of the collapse, according to Professor Ramsdell.</p>
            <p>A bibliography of the writings of the author and an introduction by a distinguished native of
                    Indiana, Dean Wendell H. Stephenson of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> State University, are other features of the work. The editor of this series acted
                    wisely in publishing these lectures even though the author did not live to give them the revision he
                    had planned.</p>
            <p>The second volume is also an interesting description of life in the Confederacy among the common
                    people. The author is a much younger man but one who produced an excellent volume in 1943, <hi rend="i">The Life of Johnny Reb: The Common Soldier of the Confederacy</hi> (see review in this
                    periodical, XXXIX, June, 1943, pp. 192-93), and an earlier volume on <hi rend="i">Southern
                    Negroes,</hi> 1861-1865. The material presented in chapters one and three of the present work bears
                    considerable <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-040-2-085"/> able resemblance in shorter form to these volumes.
                    The new material, therefore, is to be found largely in the second chapter, "The Folk at
                    Home." Even this chapter contains some information which had been presented by Ramsdell.</p>
            <p>The beginning student of Confederate history will find much interest in this volume, but the scholar
                    will turn rather to the author's longer works. The realistic approach and the rejection of
                    former idealistic pictures of negroes, soldiers, and people alike should appeal to students of
                    Southern history.</p>

                    old trail, no known aspects of the arduous journeys undertaken by western pioneers have escaped Mrs.
                    Paden's attention. The organization of the caravans, the battles with the elements, and
                    accounts of Indian attacks, hunger, thirst, and death are related. Personalities such as Marcus and
                    Narcissa Whitman, Meacham, Bridges, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Hunt, and the Applegates appear frequently. Since the author is not confined to any
                    one particular year or to any particular migration, she draws, as did Archer B. Hulbert in his <hi rend="i">Forty-Niners,</hi> upon related experiences for her illustrative material. A white man
                    is skinned alive by Indians, and wagons are lost in the quicksands of the meandering Platte River.
                    She weaves in the history surrounding the innumerable historic landmarks, some of which, like
                    Chimney Rock and Court House Rock, will remain monuments for all time.</p>
            <p>The maps and drawings are also of Mrs. Paden's handiwork. <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-040-2-086"/> The former comprise sections of the trail and, when pieced together, form a remarkably detailed
                    and accurate map of the entire route with important place names, cutoffs, streams, and other
                    landmarks clearly indicated.</p>
            <p>Wartime restrictions, unfortunately, have necessitated encasing the volume in an inexpensive-looking
                    binding. Such a good and interesting book is deserving of a more attractive cover.</p>

                  <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>, <region type="county">Greene</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> counties-the indices begin with the first marriage records in the counties. For some
                    counties the indices to the marriage records did not begin until 1882. Names of the men and women
                    are listed in alphabetical order with the date of marriage and reference to the book and page of the
                    original volume on which the record may be found.</p>
            <p>The systematic recording of births and deaths was not begun in Indiana until 1882, and in many
                    counties the records are not complete until a much later date. The indices to the birth records show
                    the name of the father and mother and the date of birth. Unfortunately, the Christian name given to
                    the child is not recorded in the original records in about half of the cases, the attending
                    physician apparently turning in the record that a child was born without waiting to learn the name
                    given to it. The indices to the death records cover in general the period from 1882 to 1920 and show
                    the date and place of death and the age at death.</p>
            <p>In addition to the above indices, the names recorded in the Federal Census of 1880 were copied for
                    the following counties: Clinton, Howard, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Jasper</region>, <region type="county">Marion</region>
               </placeName>, Parke, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby</region>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. These show the age of each person at that time and include children as well as adults.
                    The Genealogy Division also has the original census for Center Township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>

                    </placeName> the <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-040-2-088"/> indices cover only the birth records,
                    1882-1920. For <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Kosciusko</region>
                    </placeName> and La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Grange counties</region>
                    </placeName>, the indices cover the birth and death records from 1882 to 1920 but not the marriage
                    records. Marriage applications and transcripts and lists of registered voters are indexed for some
                    counties.</p>
            <p>Although the original records, and especially the birth records, upon which these indices are based
                    are known to be incomplete and to contain errors and other errors may be expected in the
                    transcribing and copying of names, nevertheless persons interested in genealogical research will
                    welcome the addition of this material to the collection in the State Library and will no doubt find
                    these indices very useful and valuable.</p>
