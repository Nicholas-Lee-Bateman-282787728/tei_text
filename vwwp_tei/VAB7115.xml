                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                        be made <emph rend="i">sensible</emph>, and where can sensibility
                        (consciousness) lie except in the <foreign xml:lang="lat" rend="i">sensorium</foreign> which manifests that property? On the ground alone
                        of consciousness or sensation being a somatic office or function it can only
                        be, like all other organic functions, an emanation of the self, and hence we
                        are coerced into the conclusion that all things are but forms of the <emph rend="i">Ego itself, at once both Creator and Creation</emph>.</p>
                    <p>This nonâanimism thus makes each unit of humanity all that has, in

                        Theism disappears as a childish illusion utterly incompatible with right
                        reason and rational ethics. All religious ideals and systemsâ none more than
                        the Christianâare based on hideous immorality. For what can be more

                        logical fiction. For how can the Parthenogenetic birth of Christ redeem him
                        from the primeval âcurseâ entailed on all mankind by the mythical
                        âdisobedienceâ of our federal head and representative? From this âcurseâ
                        virgins are no more exempt than their grandmothers, and thus, on its own
                            <foreign xml:lang="lat">data</foreign>, Christianity is âhoist with its
                        own petard.â Indeed, a <emph rend="i">replica</emph> of Adamâs abiogenetic
                        âcreationâ would not serve, since earth and air partook of the âcurseâ
                        entailed on our âfirst parents.â No God is needed since man is seen to be an
                        Autochthon, and, as such, an Anteus, who derives all the faculties required
                        for existence out of the telluric <foreign xml:lang="lat">matrix</foreign>

                        he himselfâeach for eachâ is his own law, standard, criterion, and <emph rend="i">final</emph> court of appeal. Clericals of all denominations

                        invoked their muse as a source of inspiration separate from themselves! But,
                        in our age, all such confusion of thought is a really inexcusable blunder,
                        which must, sooner or later, prove a Nemesis to that vicious civilisation

                        as he was with the diabolic and other superstitions of a Thuringian forest
                        coalâburner, he was filled with disgust at the Atheism then prevalent amid
                        the priesthood and cultured classes. The former openly scoffed at the
                        Christian mysteries as <foreign xml:lang="fre" rend="i">cochonerie</foreign>. He introduced into his creed, which so long has
                        imposed on Northern Europe and New England, all these degrading <foreign xml:lang="lat" rend="i">arcana</foreign>. So that, for more than two
                        hundred years, Germany, especially, fell quite to the rear, as compared with
                        France and England, in ethical and intellectual progress. Till the peace of
                        Westphalia in 1648, at the close of the Thirty Yearsâ War, all was, in that
                        vast region, pure chaos. Indeed, till Frederic the Greatâs time, a century
                        later, things were little better. Even to the very close of his reign that
                        âfirst of German sons,â who was himself a noted Voltairean, as Schiller
                        pathetically laments in his fine poem, âThe German Muse,â cherished the
                        opinion, which subsequent events have proved so delusive, that the Germans
                        were âirreclaimable barbarians,â as he also held Shakespeare to be, whose
                        dramas he thought only fit for the savages of Canada. And this though in
                            his<pb n="xv" xml:id="VAB7115-011"/> own lifetime Kant, Schelling,
                        Fichte, BÃ¼rger, Lessing, Herder, Goethe, Richter, and Schillerâs âRobbers,â
                        which last, no doubt, was especially distasteful to the great king, were
                        already above the horizon. David Hume, it will be remembered, delivered a
                        similar verdict upon the English â<q type="inline">barbarians on the banks
                            of the Thames</q>.â He held them as already quite below the pale of
                        Philosophyâa verdict fully corroborated by Lord Bacon in his essay on âThe
                        True Greatness of Kingdoms,â and on âThe Wisdom of the Ancients.â Commerce
                        he especially held to flourish during the disruption and decay of
                        nations.</p>

                        <head type="sub">From the Italian of Dante (âPurgatorio,â Canto VIII., v.
                            43â84).</head>

                        <l>Among the mighty Dead, now let us go;</l>
                        <l>The sight of thee will please the spirits well.</l>
                        <l>In but three steps, meseems, I was below,</l>
                        <l>And gazing on me only, one came nigh,</l>
                        <l>Attent, as though my face he fain would know.</l>
                        <l>It was the time when eve englooms the sky,</l>
                        <l>Yet not so dusk but that a closer view</l>
                        <l>Made clear the darkling path from eye to eye.</l>
                        <l>Noble Judge Nino, how I gloried when</l>
                        <l>I saw thou wast not with the damnÃ«d crew!</l>
                        <l>All words of courteous greeting spake we; then</l>
                        <l>He askedââHow long since camest thou to us</l>
                        <l>Beneath this mount, oâer seas beyond our ken?â</l>
                        <l>âI came by those dread regions dolorous</l>
                        <l>This morning, with my first life undecayed,</l>
                        <l>In hope to gain the second, journeying thus.â</l>
                        <l>And when they heard this answer that I made</l>
                        <l>He and Sordello shrank back, as in fear,</l>

                        <l>Like folk by sudden wonder all dismayed.</l>
                        <l>This turned toward Virgilâthat, to one who near</l>
                        <l>Was sitting, criedââUp, Conrad, from thy place;</l>
                        <l>What God in mercy wills, come and see and hear!â</l>
                        <l>Then to me turningââBy that special grace</l>
                        <l>Granted to thee by Him, who from our sense</l>
                        <l>Conceals his primal Why, which none may traceâ</l>
                        <l>When thou shalt pass beyond the seas, far hence,</l>

                        <l>Which, heartâsick, she shall wish that still she wore.</l>
                        <l>From her thou mayest understand aright</l>
                        <l>How long will burn the fire of womanâs love</l>
                        <l>Not kindled fresh by daily touch and sight.</l>
                        <l>Less nobly will her funeral pageant move</l>
                        <l>Beneath the Milan warriorâs viperâshield</l>
                        <l>Than were Galluraâs cock emblazed above.â</l>
                        <l>Such words he uttered, seeming stamped and sealed</l>
                        <l>With that just ardour, whose attempered heat</l>
                        <l>His heart still cherished, and his face revealed.</l>

                        <l>Through day and night he sees the same fair beams.</l>
                        <l>Come, dream again; or, if thy lawless mind</l>
                        <l>Have seen the sun, and can no more be blind,</l>
                        <l>For eyes profane as thine the daylight keep,</l>
                        <l>Nor wake the sainted souls who yet can sleep.</l>
                        <l>Yon murderer, cheered with sacramental wine,</l>
                        <l>Has higher hopes and holier thoughts than thine.</l>
                        <l>âTis merciful to hang him, for perhaps</l>
                        <l>His convalescent conscience might relapse:</l>

                        <l>Shall hands newâcleansed caress that cowering wife?</l>
                        <l>(Poor wretch, who knows not yet the loftier life!</l>
                        <l>Blighted and scarred, grown dull of heart and eye,</l>
                        <l>Mother of starveling children, born to die.)</l>
                        <l>What if the fiend, with seven more vile, returned,</l>
                        <l>And banished all the truth, so quickly learned?</l>
                        <l>Yet has he passed the mystic second birth,</l>
                        <l>Prepared for heaven, though quite unfit for earth.</l>
                        <l>Straight from the gallows shall his spirit fly</l>
                        <l>To join the whiteârobed company on high,</l>
                        <l>Despatched in mercy to the heavenly shore,</l>
                        <l>To kick his wife, to kill his friends, no more.</l>

                        <l>Just Ruler! when we strive the truth to win</l>
                        <l>A false conclusion is a damning sin:</l>

                        <l>We are the Church of God, and he is just.</l>

                        <l>Better be deaf and blind than leave the Church.</l>

                            to look at and an education to read. I have enjoyed myself this
                            afternoon going through it, and reading again some of our dear friendâs
                            words, so thoughtful, so farâseeing, so true, and so beautifully
                            expressed. I am sure that the book will be deeply valued by those who
                            knew and loved Miss Naden, and will do good to those who did not. I
                            think that you have selected and arranged your material and your
                            subjects very nicely indeed, so that the excerpts almost read like a
                            continuous story or argument.â</item>

                            returning my most grateful thanks for your charming little volume. I am
                            not quite sure that I am prepared to argue that Constance Nadenâs
                                <foreign xml:lang="ita">forte</foreign> was not poetry, but
                            philosophy. Had she lived, I think we should have seen surprising
                            developments in both directions. As it is, we who knew her feel nothing
                            but thankfulness for what she has left us. I hope your volume will have
                            the large circulation it deserves.â</item>

                            from the late Miss Nadenâs books. It will he difficult to say whether I

                            mainly for her poetry; but a mind highly scientific is shown by the

                                    Naden to write aboutâso fair, so young, so fresh, so talented,
                                    so full of brilliant promise; but, alas! it must be added, so
                                    frail and shortâlived, cut off in the very bud of womanhood. The
                                    end is sad, but the beautiful little star has left a trail of
                                    light behind, and has been so happy as to have a Dr. Lewins for

                                        detus</foreign>. Miss Naden had the gift to see the hidden
                                    genius of her mentor, and Dr. Lewins to discern the flower shut

                                <p>âIt is not often that such a combination of talent as poetry and
                                    philosophy is met with in the same person; but Miss Naden was a
                                    poet born, and made herself wise in science and philosophy. Her
                                    penetration was quick and keen, and she seems to have been about
                                    the only one able to grasp the difficult subject of
                                    HyloâIdealism. She saw at once that objects, till they became
                                    subjects, cannot enter into the<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7115-372"/>
                                    sphere of our consciousness, and therefore are to us virtually
                                    as good as nonâexistent.</p>
                                <p>âMany have read about HyloâIdealism, but have been surely puzzled
                                    to reconcile it with their foregone conceptions; but, then,
                                    every new phase of progress has this stumbling block as a rock
                                    of offence. Geology had a long uphill fight with prejudice, so
                                    had astronomy, so indeed had machinery; but Miss Naden, from the
                                    very first, grasped the whole subject, and tried, not without
                                    notable success, to popularise what, to her own mind, was
                                    completely selfâevident.</p>
                                <p>âOthers of her philosophical and scientific excursions show the
                                    same intuitive penetration, and probably, had her life been
                                    spared, her name would have been bracketed with that of Mrs.
                                    Somerville; as it is, H. Spencer says that Miss Naden and George
                                    Eliot, the two female Warwickshire poets and thinkers, are on a
                                    par, and he does not know where to find a third.</p>
                                <p>âMiss Nadenâs poetry has the true ring of precious metal; but,
                                    like Kirk White, Keats, and Shelley, her age was only a little,
                                    little day. But I am not going to dwell here on this subject,

                                    blueâcovered book, evidently a special favourite; it falls open
                                    easily in the hand, and various marks on the margin show that it
                                    has been âread, marked, learnt, and inwardly digested.â The very
                                    name conjures up visions of spring blossoms, and, as the pages

                                    written on the cover. The poems are gems: they range from grave
                                    to gay, now and then a deeper note is struck; the song falls
                                    into a plaintive, minor key, and the sweet singer touches on the
                                    mysteries of life and death. Here is a song of âTwilight,â in

                                emphatically the truth that Mr. Herbert Spencer so strongly insists

                                the exercise of imagination and the love of the beautiful. On the

                                of a tall, soft, fair girl, who, perhaps, would not have attracted
                                much attention from a<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7115-375"/> society of
                                butterflies; but the more the Thinker looked at her, the more he
                                felt drawn to know something about her. She was born to great
                                things, but her brain was too big for her frail frame, and she died
                                in Mayfair from illness contracted in India (as one might say)
                                little more than a child, leaving the world a flower the less. She
                                had made her mark in poetry and in science; and, if that bud had
                                lived to open, one cannot foresee what track of light she was
                                capable of leaving behind. She was not only a poet, but a chemist, a
                                psychologist, andâmay I say, alas!âa Freethinker. If she has left
                                behind many admirers, she has left one faithful friend, who will
                                always keep her memory green; and no one is fitter to sympathise

                                poetry. I liked the poems when they first came out; but I never
                                trust my judgment as to English poetry. I am no judge of English
                                poetry, so far as the jingle of rhyme and the glamour of words are
                                concerned. Tennyson once told me that the only excuse for rhyme was
                                that it helped the memory. That may have been so in ancient times;
                                but is it so now? My only test of poetry is: Does it stand
                                translation into prose? It struck me when I read Miss Nadenâs poems
                                that several of them would stand that test, and I am glad to hear
                                that the world has found it out.â</p>

                                clearness of perception and presentation which illuminates all she
                                has written. Combining the womanâs delicate intuition with the more
                                masculine power of firm logic, she gave promise of taking a position
                                in speculative philosophy to which no woman and very few men have
                                attained. And then death came just when her rich nature was

                                she belonged to my own sex springs up when<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7115-376"/> I contemplate her varied gifts and keenly

                                are remembered, every other sentiment gives way to poignant regret.
                                The earnest truthâseeking of her nature and her simple allegiance to

                                very well, and I need not say that I greatly valued the friendship
                                which she extended to my wife and to myself. I read with much
                                interest the first volume of poetry which she published in 1880,
                                âSongs and Sonnets of Springtime.â I still think it full of girlish
                                grace. In the âSongs and Sonnets of Springtimeâ I would name âThe
                                Abbotâ as full of promise. Again, when her youth is remembered, and
                                that her studies were all made in England, her translations from the
                                German seem to me of great merit. Thus the Sonnet, âBury the Dead
                                Thou Lovest,â from the German of Karl Siebel, is most gracefully
                                rendered; and I think her translation of Schillerâs âKnight of
                                Toggenburg,â âLife and the Ideal,â etc., may be compared with those
                                of more distinguished translators. Her wonderful mastery of the
                                German language is shown in the Sonnet, âDas Ideal.â Her skill in
                                design and taste in art are shown in the floral decoration on the
                                cover of the volumes in question.â</p>

                                Birmingham, where she distinguished herself particularly in <ref target="#naden-note04">Logic and Philosophy</ref>. Miss Naden
                                was elected a member of our Society in 1888, and at once attracted
                                attention by her clear and striking contributions to Our
                                discussions. It was her intention to have read a paper during this
                                Session on âRationalist and Empiricist Ethics,â but her fatal
                                illness prevented her from accomplishing it. The notes prepared by
                                Miss Naden for this paper are printed on page 77 of this journal, as
                                well as others which were found among her papers, on âThe Place of

                                December last, at the early age of thirtyâone, has been the subject
                                of very general regret, and the public press has given a full
                                account of her life and work. The essay on âInduction and

                                with anything of Constance Nadenâs writings, and to such the volume
                                before usâa dainty little volume, giltâedged, and tastefully
                                boundâwill give some insight into her style of work and thought.
                                Miss Naden, who died in 1889, was a philosopher of somewhat advanced
                                views; we are told in the very brief introduction to these
                                âSelectionsâ that âthe thought currents of our day are even now
                                setting in the direction she indicated,â that Herbert Spencer
                                thought her endowed with the exceptional combination of âreceptivity
                                and originalityâ in an equally great degree, and that she was an
                                exponent of âSynthetic Monism.â Anyone who wishes to verify these
                                assertions may do so by help of the extracts from her âEssaysâ and

                                was distinctly philosophical, and her ripest energies were directed
                                in this channel. These isolated gems shine with delightful lustre

                                of them. It was a happy thought which induced the Misses Hughes to
                                prepare this charming book of selections. They are derived from all
                                Miss Nadenâs published works, her two volumes of poems and her prose
                                works issued since her much deplored death. The extracts have been
                                selected with great skill and discrimination, and they will do much
                                to make a wider circle of readers acquainted with the philosophic
                                insight, power of giving lucid expression to abstruse thoughts, and
                                the literary excellences of the greatest local genius of modern

                                of Constance C. W. Naden,â compiled by Emily and Edith Hughes, with
                                an introduction by George M. McCrie. It is always a pleasure to meet
                                with fresh indications of the farâreaching influence of Miss Nadenâs
                                philosophical and literary works, and the present volume is likely
                                to be especially useful in interesting those who are not already
                                acquainted with her books. The selections have been made with much
                                care and thought, and are calculated to give a considerable insight
                                into her philosophical teaching. About twoâthirds of the volume is
                                devoted to extracts from the philosophical writings, the remainder
                                to the poems. Among the latter we note the exquisite âPantheistâs
                                Song of Immortality,â probably the best known of her poetical works,
                                and also the charmingly humorous âScientific Wooing,â âTile New
                                Orthodoxy,â and âSolomon Redivivus,â the first of which appeared in

                                was one of its leading spirits. The volume is well got up, and in
                                every way suitable for a giftâbook. We wish it every success.ââ

                                depreciating notice of her poetry and philosophy, which have
                                extorted the approval of thinkers like Herbert Spencer, Dr. Samuel
                                Smiles, Dr. R. W. Dale, Lord Reay Mr. Gladstone, and other

                            <p>The difficulty in the way of a satisfactory appreciation of her
                                thesis is well cleared up by her own essay, âWhat is Religion?â and
                                by my pamphlet, âHumanism <abbr>v</abbr>. Theism,â and also by Mr.
                                G. M. McCrieâs leaflet, âSadducee <abbr>v</abbr>. Phariseeâ (Bickers
                                and Son). Its gist may be summarised in a very few words by
                                characterizing it as the <emph rend="i">subjectivation of the
                                    objective</emph>, exactly Kantâs negation of âThing in Itself,â
                                the highâwater mark of that cosmopolitan metaphysician, a standpoint
                                from which he receded in all his profound works after the <emph rend="i">first</emph> edition of the âCritique of Pure Reason.â
                                It is nothing new, but only the present highâwater mark and position
                                of contemporary exact science and ethics. It is clear that, on these

                                being <emph rend="i">creates</emph> and determines its own cosmos

                                interest from the fact that the talented young authoress has not

                                clear, concise, well arranged, and carefully thought out; and leads
                                one to believe that, had the hand of Death been withheld, Miss Naden
                                would have made valuable contributions to philosophic thought. For
                                Miss Naden the fundamental principle in philosophy is the famous
                                Protagorean formula of relativity, that âman is, to man, the measure
                                of all things, of things that are that they are, and of things that
                                are not that they are not.â<ref target="#naden-note10">*</ref> She
                                insists on the close interâconnection of induction and deduction in

                                complementary. Both involve cognition and recognition; but, whereas
                                induction is a process of cognition involving recognitions,
