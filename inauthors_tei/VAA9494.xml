                                          <l>And cried, "Give help!" But they said, "Let be:</l>

                                          <pb id="VAA9494-036" n="28"/>

                                          <l>A foolish fear: God could not punish so.</l>
                                          <l>Yet until yesterday I thought He would.</l>
                                          <l>My soul was always cowering at the blow</l>
                                          <l>I saw suspended, ready to be dealt</l>
                                          <l>The moment that I showed my fear too much.</l>
                                          <l>Therefore I hid it from Him all I could,</l>
                                          <l>And only stole a shaking glance at it</l>
                                          <l>Sometimes in the dead minutes before dawn</l>
                                          <l>When He forgets to watch. Till yesterday.</l>
                                          <l>For yesterday was wonderful and strange</l>
                                          <l>From the beginning. When I wakened first</l>
                                          <l>And looked out at the window, the last snow</l>
                                          <l>Was gone from earth; about the apple-trees</l>
                                          <l>Hung a faint mist of bloom; small sudden green</l>
                                          <l>Had run and spread and rippled everywhere</l>
                                          <l>Over the fields; and in the level sun</l>
                                          <l>Walked something like a presence and a power,</l>
                                          <l>Uttering hopes and loving-kindnesses</l>
                                          <l>To all the world, but chiefly unto me.</l>
                                          <l>It walked before me when I went to work,</l>
                                          <l>And all day long the noises of the mill</l>
                                          <l>Were spun upon a core of golden sound,</l>
                                          <l>Half-spoken words and interrupted songs</l>
                                          <l>Of blessed promise, meant for all the world,</l>
                                          <l>But most for me, because I suffered most.</l>
                                          <l>The shooting spindles, the smooth-humming wheels,</l>

                                          <pb id="VAA9494-037" n="29"/>

                                          <l>The rocking webs, seemed toiling to some end</l>
                                          <l>Beneficent and human known to them,</l>
                                          <l>And duly brought to pass in power and love.</l>
                                          <l>The faces of the girls and men at work</l>
                                          <l>Met mine with intense greeting, veiled at once,</l>
                                          <l>As if they knew a secret they must keep</l>
                                          <l>For fear the joy would harm me if they told</l>
                                          <l>Before some inkling filtered to my mind</l>
                                          <l>In roundabout ways. When the day's work was done</l>
                                          <l>There lay a special silence on the fields;</l>
                                          <l>And, as I passed, the bushes and the trees,</l>
                                          <l>The very ruts and puddles of the road</l>
                                          <l>Spoke to each other, saying it was she,</l>
                                          <l>The happy woman, the elected one,</l>
                                          <l>The vessel of strange mercy and the sign</l>
                                          <l>Of many loving wonders done in Heaven</l>
                                          <l>To help the piteous earth.</l>
                                   </lg>
                                   <lg>
                                          <l rend="right">At last I stopped</l>
                                          <l>And looked about me in sheer wonderment.</l>
                                          <l>What did it mean? What did they want with me?</l>
                                          <l>What was the matter with the evening now</l>
                                          <l>That it was just as bound to make me glad</l>
                                          <l>As morning and the live-long day had been?</l>
                                          <l>Me, who had quite forgot what gladness was,</l>

                                          <pb id="VAA9494-038" n="30"/>

                                          <l>Who had no right to anything but toil,</l>
                                          <l>And food and sleep for strength to toil again,</l>
                                          <l>And that fierce frightened anguish of my love</l>
                                          <l>For the poor little spirit I had wronged</l>
                                          <l>With life that was no life. What had befallen</l>
                                          <l>Since yesterday? No need to stop and ask!</l>
                                          <l>Back there in the dark places of my mind</l>
                                          <l>Where I had thrust it, fearing to believe</l>
                                          <l>An unbelievable mercy, shone the news</l>
                                          <l>Told by the village neighbors coming home</l>
                                          <l>Last night from the great city, of a man</l>
                                          <l>Arisen, like the first evangelists,</l>
                                          <l>With power to heal the bodies of the sick,</l>
                                          <l>In testimony of his master Christ,</l>
                                          <l>Who heals the soul when it is sick with sin.</l>
                                          <l>Could such a thing be true in these hard days?</l>
                                          <l>Was help still sent in such a way as that?</l>
                                          <l>No, no! I did not dare to think of it,</l>
                                          <l>Feeling what weakness and despair would come</l>
                                          <l>After the crazy hope broke under me.</l>
                                          <l>I turned and started homeward, faster now,</l>
                                          <l>But never fast enough to leave behind</l>
                                          <l>The voices and the troubled happiness</l>
                                          <l>That still kept mounting, mounting like a sea,</l>
                                          <l>And singing far-off like a rush of wings.</l>
                                          <l>Far down the road a yellow spot of light</l>
                                          <l>Shone from my cottage window, rayless yet,</l>

                                          <pb id="VAA9494-039" n="31"/>

                                          <l>Where the last sunset crimson caught the panes.</l>
                                          <l>Alice had lit the lamp before she went;</l>
                                          <l>Her day of pity and unmirthful play</l>
                                          <l>Was over, and her young heart free to live</l>
                                          <l>Until to-morrow brought her nursing-task</l>
                                          <l>Again, and made her feel how dark and still</l>
                                          <l>That life could be to others which to her</l>
                                          <l>Was full of dreams that beckoned, reaching hands,</l>
                                          <l>And thrilling invitations young girls hear.</l>
                                          <l>My boy was sleeping, little mind and frame</l>
                                          <l>More tired just lying there awake two hours</l>
                                          <l>Than with a whole day's romp he should have been.</l>
                                          <l>He would not know his mother had come home;</l>
                                          <l>But after supper I would sit awhile</l>
                                          <l>Beside his bed, and let my heart have time</l>
                                          <l>For that worst love that stabs and breaks and
                                                 kills.</l>
                                          <l>This I thought over to myself by rote</l>
                                          <l>And habit, but I could not feel my thoughts;</l>
                                          <l>For still that dim unmeaning happiness</l>
                                          <l>Kept mounting, mounting round me like a sea,</l>
                                          <l>And singing inward like a wind of wings.</l>
                                   </lg>
                                   <lg>
                                          <l>Before I lifted up the latch, I knew.</l>
                                          <l>I felt no fear; the One who waited there</l>
                                          <l>In the low lamplight by the bed, had come</l>
                                          <l>Because I was his sister and in need.</l>

                                          <pb id="VAA9494-040" n="32"/>

                                          <l>My word had got to Him somehow at last,</l>
                                          <l>And He had come to help me or to tell</l>
                                          <l>Where help was to be found. It was not strange.</l>
                                          <l>Strange only He had stayed away so long;</l>
                                          <l>But that should be forgotten -- He was here.</l>
                                          <l>I pushed the door wide open and looked in.</l>
                                          <l>He had been kneeling by the bed, and now,</l>
                                          <l>Half-risen, kissed my boy upon the lips,</l>
                                          <l>Then turned and smiled and pointed with his hand.</l>
                                          <l>I must have fallen on the threshold stone,</l>
                                          <l>For I remember that I felt, not saw,</l>
                                          <l>The resurrection glory and the peace</l>
                                          <l>Shed from his face and raiment as He went</l>
                                          <l>Out by the door into the evening street.</l>
                                          <l>But when I looked, the place about the bed</l>
                                          <l>Was yet all bathed in light, and in the midst</l>
                                          <l>My boy lay changed, -- no longer clothed upon</l>
                                          <l>With scraps and shreds of life, but like the child</l>
                                          <l>Of some most fortunate mother. In a breath</l>
                                          <l>The image faded. There he lay again</l>
                                          <l>The same as always; and the light was gone.</l>
                                          <l>I sank with moans and cries beside the bed.</l>
                                          <l>The cruelty, 0 Christ, the cruelty!</l>
                                          <l>To come at last and then to go like that,</l>
                                          <l>Leaving the darkness deeper than before!</l>

                                          <pb id="VAA9494-041" n="33"/>

                                          <l>Then, though I heard no sound, I grew aware</l>
                                          <l>Of some one standing by the open door</l>
                                          <l>Among the dry vines rustling in the porch.</l>
                                          <l>My heart laughed suddenly. He had come back!</l>
                                          <l>He had come back to make the vision true.</l>
                                          <l>He had not meant to mock me: God was God,</l>
                                          <l>And Christ was Christ; there was no falsehood
                                                 there.</l>
                                          <l>I heard a quiet footstep cross the room</l>
                                          <l>And felt a hand laid gently on my hair, --</l>
                                          <l>A human hand, worn hard by daily toil,</l>
                                          <l>Heavy with life-long struggle after bread.</l>
                                          <l>Alice's father. The kind homely voice</l>
                                          <l>Had in it such strange music that I dreamed</l>
                                          <l>Perhaps it was the Other speaking in him,</l>
                                          <l>Because His own bright form had made me swoon</l>
                                          <l>With its too much of glory. What he brought</l>
                                          <l>Was news as good as ever heavenly lips</l>
                                          <l>Had the dear right to utter. He had been</l>
                                          <l>All day among the crowds of curious folk</l>
                                          <l>From the great city and the country-side</l>
                                          <l>Gathered to watch the Healer do his work</l>
                                          <l>Of mercy on the sick and halt and blind,</l>
                                          <l>And with his very eyes had seen such things</l>
                                          <l>As awestruck men had witnessed long ago</l>
                                          <l>In Galilee, and writ of in the Book.</l>
                                          <l>To-morrow morning he would take me there</l>

                                          <l>It might be there was hope; he could not say,</l>
                                          <l>But knew what he had seen. When he was gone</l>
                                          <l>I lay for hours, letting the solemn waves</l>
                                          <l>Thundering joy go over and over me.</l>

                                          <l>Just before midnight baby fretted, woke;</l>
                                          <l>He never yet has slept a whole night through</l>
                                          <l>Without his food and petting. As I sat</l>
                                          <l>Feeding and petting him and singing soft,</l>
                                          <l>I felt a jealousy begin to ache</l>
                                          <l>And worry at my heartstrings, hushing down</l>
                                          <l>The gladness. Jealousy of what or whom?</l>
                                          <l>I hardly knew, or could not put in words;</l>
                                          <l>At least it seemed too foolish and too wrong</l>
                                          <l>When said, and so I shut the thought away.</l>

                                          <l>After the change, would my boy be the same</l>
                                          <l>As this one? Would he be my boy at all,</l>
                                          <l>And not another's -- his who gave the life</l>
                                          <l>I could not give, or did not anyhow?</l>
                                          <l>How could I look in his new eyes to claim</l>

                                          <l>The dark injustice, the unnatural pain.</l>

                                          <l>I raised the bedroom window and leaned out.</l>
                                          <l>The white moon, low behind the sycamores,</l>
                                          <l>Silvered the silent country; not a voice</l>

                                          <l>Had yet awakened; in the level moon</l>
                                          <l>Walked that same presence I had heard at dawn</l>

                                          <l>0, how to cleanse me of the cowardice!</l>

                                          <l>As her own covetous and morbid love?</l>

                                          <l>Cared nothing for me. They had never heard</l>
                                          <l>Of me nor of my business. When I asked</l>
                                          <l>My way, a shade of pity or contempt</l>
                                          <l>Showed through men's kindness -- for they all were
                                                 kind.</l>
                                          <l>Daunted and chilled and very sick at heart,</l>
                                          <l>I walked the endless pavements. But at last</l>
                                          <l>The streets grew quieter; the houses seemed</l>
                                          <l>As if they might be homes where people lived;</l>
                                          <l>Then came the factories and cottages,</l>
                                          <l>And all was well again. Much more than well,</l>
                                          <l>For many sick and broken went my way,</l>
                                          <l>Alone or helped along by loving hands.;</l>
                                          <l>And from a thousand eyes the famished hope</l>
                                          <l>Looked out at mine -- wild, patient, querulous,</l>
                                          <l>But always hope and hope, a thousand tongues</l>
                                          <l>Speaking one word in many languages.</l>
                                   </lg>

                                          <l>There on the steps, above the waiting crowd,</l>
                                          <l>And touch with healing hands whoever asks</l>
                                          <l>Believingly, in spirit and in truth.</l>
                                          <l>Can such a mercy be, in these hard days?</l>
                                          <l>Is help still sent in such a way as that?</l>
                                          <l>Christ, I believe; pity my unbelief!</l>

                                          <l>I <hi rend="sc">WONDER</hi> can this be the world it
                                                 was</l>
                                          <l>At sunset? I remember the sky fell</l>
                                          <l>Green as pale meadows, at the long street-ends,</l>
                                          <l>But overhead the smoke-wrack hugged the roofs</l>
                                          <l>As if to shut the city from God's eyes</l>
                                          <l>Till dawn should quench the laughter and the
                                                 lights.</l>
                                          <l>Beneath the gas flare stolid faces passed,</l>
                                          <l>Too dull for sin; old loosened lips set hard</l>
                                          <l>To drain the stale lees from the cup of sense;</l>
                                          <l>Or if a young face yearned from out the mist</l>
                                          <l>Made by its own bright hair, the eyes were wan</l>
                                          <l>With desolate fore-knowledge of the end.</l>
                                          <l>My life lay waste about me: as I walked,</l>
                                          <l>From the gross dark of unfrequented streets</l>
                                          <l>The face of my own youth peered forth at me,</l>
                                          <l>Struck white with pity at the thing I was;</l>
                                          <l>And globed in ghostly fire, thrice-virginal,</l>
                                          <l>With lifted face star-strong, went one who sang</l>
                                          <l>Lost verses from my youth's gold canticle.</l>
                                          <l>Out of the void dark came my face and hers</l>
                                          <l>One vivid moment -- then the street was there;</l>

                                          <l>Bloat shapes and mean eyes blotted the sear dusk;</l>
                                          <l>And in the curtained window of a house</l>
                                          <l>Whence sin reeked on the night, a shameful head</l>
                                          <l>Was silhouetted black as Satan's face</l>
                                          <l>Against eternal fires. I stumbled on</l>
                                          <l>Down the dark slope that reaches riverward,</l>
                                          <l>Stretching blind hands to find the throat of God</l>
                                          <l>And crush Him in his lies. The river lay</l>
                                          <l>Coiled in its factory filth and few lean trees.</l>
                                          <l>All was too hateful -- I could not die there!</l>
                                          <l>I whom the Spring had strained unto her breast,</l>
                                          <l>Whose lips had felt the wet vague lips of dawn.</l>
                                          <l>So under the thin willows' leprous shade</l>
                                          <l>And through the tangled ranks of riverweed</l>
                                          <l>I pushed -- till lo, God heard me! I came forth</l>
                                          <l>Where, 'neath the shoreless hush of region light,</l>
                                          <l>Through a new world, undreamed of, undesired,</l>
                                          <l>Beyond imagining of man's weary heart,</l>
                                          <l>Far to the white marge of the wondering sea</l>
                                          <l>This still plain widens, and this moon rains down</l>
                                          <l>Insufferable ecstasy of peace.</l>

                                          <l>Unspeakable affliction of mute love</l>
                                          <l>That crazes lesser things. The rocks and clods</l>
                                          <l>Dissemble, feign a busy intercourse;</l>
                                          <l>The bushes deal in shadowy subterfuge,</l>

                                          <l>Lurk dull, dart spiteful out, make heartless signs,</l>
                                          <l>Utter awestricken purpose of no sense, --</l>

                                          <l>Stretched furtively to drag me madmen's ways.</l>
                                          <l>I know the thing they suffer, and the tricks</l>

                                          <l>I would not be too boastful; I am weak,</l>
                                          <l>Too weak to put aside the utter ache</l>
                                          <l>Of this lone splendor long enough to see</l>
                                          <l>Whether the moon is still her white strange self</l>
                                          <l>Or something whiter, stranger, even the face</l>
                                          <l>Which by the changed face of my risen youth</l>
                                          <l>Sang, globed in fire, her golden canticle.</l>
                                          <l>I dare not look again; another gaze</l>
                                          <l>Might drive me to the wavering coppice there,</l>
                                          <l>Where bat-winged madness brushed me, the wild laugh</l>
                                          <l>Of naked nature crashed across my blood.</l>
                                          <l>So rank it was with earthy presences,</l>
                                          <l>Faun-shapes in goatish dance, young witches' eyes</l>
                                          <l>Slanting deep invitation, whinnying calls</l>
                                          <l>Ambiguous, shocks and whirlwinds of wild mirth, --</l>
                                          <l>They had undone me in the darkness there,</l>
                                          <l>But that within me, smiting through my lids</l>
                                          <l>Lowered to shut in the thick whirl of sense,</l>
                                          <l>The dumb light ached and rummaged, and with out,</l>

                                          <l>The soaring splendor summoned me aloud</l>
                                          <l>To leave the low dank thickets of the flesh</l>
                                          <l>Where man meets beast and makes his lair with him,</l>
                                          <l>For spirit reaches of the strenuous vast,</l>
                                          <l>Where stalwart stars reap grain to make the bread</l>
                                          <l>God breaketh at his tables and is glad.</l>

                                          <l>And gazed up at the lyric face to see</l>
                                          <l>All sweetness tasted of in earthen cups</l>
                                          <l>Ere it be dashed and spilled, all radiance flung</l>
                                          <l>Beyond experience, every benison dream,</l>
                                          <l>Treasured and mystically crescent there.</l>

                                          <l>O, who will shield me from her? Who will place</l>
                                          <l>A veil between me and the fierce in-throng</l>
                                          <l>Of her inexorable benedicite?</l>

                                          <l>Through tragic twilights when the stricken sea</l>
                                          <l>Groveled with fear; or when she made her throne</l>
                                          <l>In imminent cities built of gorgeous winds</l>
                                          <l>And paved with lightnings; or when the sobering

                                          <l>Would lead her home 'mid wealth of plundered May</l>

                                          <l>Along the violet slopes of evensong.</l>
                                          <l>Of all the sights that starred the dreamy year,</l>

                                          <l>Forests that hushed their tiniest voice to hear;</l>
                                          <l>Skies for the unutterable advent robed</l>
                                          <l>In purple like the opening iris buds;</l>
                                          <l>And by some lone expectant pool, one tree</l>
                                          <l>Whose gray boughs shivered with excess of awe, --</l>
                                          <l>As with preluding gush of amber light,</l>
                                          <l>And herald trumpets softly lifted through,</l>
                                          <l>Across the palpitant horizon marge</l>
                                          <l>Crocus-filleted came the singing moon.</l>
                                          <l>Out of her changing lights I wove my youth</l>
                                          <l>A place to dwell in, sweet and spiritual,</l>
                                          <l>And all the bitter years of my exile</l>
                                          <l>My heart has called afar off unto her.</l>
                                          <l>Lo, after many days love finds its own!</l>
                                          <l>The futile adorations, the waste tears,</l>
                                          <l>The hymns that fluttered low in the false dawn,</l>
                                          <l>She has uptreasured as a lover's gifts;</l>
                                          <l>They are the mystic garment that she wears</l>
                                          <l>Against the bridal, and the crocus flowers</l>
                                          <l>She twined her brow with at the going forth;</l>
                                          <l>They are the burden of the song she made</l>
                                          <l>In coming through the quiet fields of space,</l>

                                          <l>Calling me out along the flowering road</l>

                                          <l>I met God walking; and although the dawn</l>

                                          <l>Circled and sang about his face as birds</l>

                                          <l>Day grows and it is far to market-town."</l>
                                          <l>Once where I lay in darkness after fight,</l>
                                          <l>Sore smitten, thrilled a little thread of song</l>
                                          <l>Searching and searching at my muffled sense</l>
                                          <l>Until it shook sweet pangs through all my blood,</l>
                                          <l>And I beheld one globed in ghostly fire</l>

                                          <l>And her mouth sang, "The hosts of Hate roll past,</l>
                                          <l>A dance of dust motes in the sliding sun;</l>

                                          <l>My sick heart muttered, " Yea, the little strife,</l>

                                          <l>When she first met my father. Young incredibly,</l>
                                          <l>Younger than spring, without the faintest trace</l>

                                          <l>These close-wound ropes of pearl</l>

                                          <l>Of some waste influence</l>
