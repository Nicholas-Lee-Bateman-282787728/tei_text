            During the early nineteenth century travelers, adventurers, journalists, and diarists observed
                    westward movement and pioneer settlement in Indiana. Their books, articles, and published letters
                    frequently recorded the nativity of settlers as part of a review of the frontier scene. The nativity
                    of a frontier's already established population could be a significant factor in newer
                    pioneers' selection of location, for it might encourage migrants from the same area to join
                    their cultural kin or discourage settlers from different areas.1 Most
                    visitors' views of nativity on the frontier were, however, spatially and temporally limited
                    because they toured only a few places for short periods and collected subjective rather than
                    objective data. Therefore, travelers' conclusions about population origins are at best
                    suggestive of areal variations, but their perceptions have often been corroborated by later
                    statistical research.
            Many of these peripatetic authors were impressed by the large number of southerners residing in
                    southern Indiana. In 1816 David Thomas visited the south central region of the state and indicated:
                    "Many of the settlers in this quarter are Carolinians"; two years later he
                    traveled to 
                        Princeton
                     in southwestern Indiana where, he reported: "The inhabitants are principally
                        Kentuckians." Isaac Reed identified numerous Kentuckians at

                     in 1818, and the next year Edmund Dana noted: in 
                        Wayne County
                     "many of the settlers are from 
                        North Carolina
                    ." Dana also found Virginians in 
                        Clark County
                     on the Ohio River.2 John Woods said of his 
                        New Harmony
                     area neighbors in 1820: "Most of them are from the south, from North and
                            
                  South Carolina, Georgia
               , and 
                        Tennessee
                    . ..."3 Reed's study of the state in 1828 revealed
                    "The population is a mixture from almost every quarter; but mainly from south of the
                        Ohio river"; and according to Karl Postel, writing the same year,
                    Kentuckians filled Indiana "in the south, on the banks of the 
                        Ohio
                    , and farther up ... ." Yet Timothy Flint declared in 1826: "The
                    southern portion of this emigration seemed to entertain no small apprehension, that this also would
                    be a Yankee state," a fate that had apparently befallen 
                        Ohio
                    .4
            
            Travelers also found natives of New 
                        England
                     residing on both the northern and southern fringes of Indiana. In 1816 Thomas, while
                    visiting the southern part of the state, wrote: "our hostess at 
                        Madison
                     said, there was ‘a smart chance of yankees’ in that
                    village"; and four years later Captain James Riley, who resided near 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , described the best migration route for "emigrants from the Northern and
                    Eastern states" to reach "this section of the country." Reed discovered
                    natives of Connecticut and Massachusetts around New 
                        Albany
                    , while in 1826 Flint noted that along Indiana's banks of the Ohio
                        River "most of the newly arrived settlers that I addressed, were from Yankee
                        land."5
            
            Writers in the early nineteenth century found natives of the Middle Atlantic states dispersed
                    throughout Indiana. Traveling through 
                        Franklin County
                     in the southeast during 1817, Samuel R. Brown decided: "a considerable number
                    of the inhabitants are from the state of 
                        New York
                    "; the next year Thomas met many New Yorkers in the area surrounding 
                        Terre Haute
                    , and Reed found Pennsylvanians near New 
                        Albany
                    .6 The Philadelphian M. H. Jenks discovered that 
                        Richmond
                     was "principally inhabited by Quakers many of them from our Section of the

                    Caleb Atwater wrote that both Ohio and Indiana "may be considered as Pennsylvania and 
                        Maryland
                    , extended from the Atlantic ocean to the Wabash river. They are
                    one and the same people. . . ."8
            
            As time passed and the pioneer period receded, interest in all aspects of Indiana's
                    development increased. Numerous studies of the state's population origins appeared in
                    various publications, some as early as 1908.9 Among the sources consulted by
                    these early writers were reminiscences of pioneers, biographies contained in county histories and
                    atlases of the late 1800s and early 1900s, lists of former residences available in the General Land
                    Office records, and summaries of birthplaces collected by the decennial 
                        United States
                     censuses. The census soon became the most popular reference among researchers.
                    Beginning in 1850 census canvassers were required to ask all inhabitants to identify the state or
                    foreign nation of their birth. The census bureau published these state and country nativity totals
                    for each of the states in 1850 and 1860; starting with the 1870 data, tables listing a few major
                    states and countries of nativity in every county were also published. The bureau has gradually
                    granted public access to the original manuscript schedules compiled for the 1850 through 1910
                    censuses and has microfilmed them for wider dissemination, allowing researchers to determine the
                    nativity of settlers in any county.10

                     Indiana.11 Lang examined the 1850
                    manuscript schedules to describe the population origins and age structure in twenty-one (now
                    twenty-two) northern Indiana counties, which included 165,286 settlers from the state's
                    population of 988,416. The present article incorporates Lang's work but expands the scope
                    to cover all 
                        United States
                    -born residents of Indiana in 1850. Over 800,000 settlers in the state's
                    seventy central and southern counties were surveyed from microfilms of the manuscript census
                    schedules. Foreign-born Hoosiers were not considered because the research focused on the internal
                    migration of nativity groups and because only 54,426 foreign born, composing just 5.5 percent of the
                    total population, resided in Indiana in 1850.12 An examination of changing
                    nativity sources over time was also not attempted; rather, the article provides a snapshot of
                    Indiana's 
                        United States
                    -born population in 1850, considers the distribution of settlement groups, and provides
                    explanations for the concentration patterns.13

                            Indiana was the smallest of any state in the Old Northwest; only Minnesota Territory
                            contained fewer.

                            numbers, while Ohio was closest in percentage with 11.0 (218,512 foreigners resided there).

                            , D.C., 1853), Table XV, pp. xxxvi-xxxviii. Although for the purposes of this
                            study foreign nativity by county was not recorded, impressions left by a review of the
                            census schedules were that Germans tended to settle in agricultural areas and that the Irish
                            were often found in counties bordering the Ohio River. Elfrieda Lang
                            counted the foreign born in twenty-one northern Indiana counties, where they comprised 6.6
                            percent of the total population, slightly more than the state's average. Lang,

                             natives were found in the largest number, followed by the Irish, Canadians, and
                            English. In most counties less than 5 percent of the population was foreign born while in
                            two, Allen and Lake, foreign born comprised over 20 percent of the population. Lang also

                     because each of its six states supplied so few migrants.14 Table 2 presents for every county the percentage of population native to
                    selected states or regions, excluding native Hoosiers and those born outside the 
                        United States
                    . Figure 1 identifies Indiana's counties in 1850. Figures 2-A through 5 point
                    out those counties having larger percentages of inhabitants from other states or regions than
                    Indiana's average. For example, Tables 1 and 2 indicate that 
                        Adams County
                     had 2,079 Ohio natives in its non-native Hoosier population of 3,255, or 63.9 percent
                    of the total; 
                        Orange County
                     had 55 Ohioans, accounting for 1.8 percent of its similarly defined population of
                    3,061. The statewide average for Ohioans was 31.4 percent; thus, on Figure 4-B 
                        Adams County
                     is designated as above the mean while 
                        Orange County
                     was below it and remains unmarked.
            Residents born in Indiana were not included in Table 2 because their large number and great county to
                    county range obscure the variation among the other states of nativity. Native Hoosiers comprised an
                    average of 56.0 percent of the state's total population in 1850, reaching a high of 75.9
                    percent in Dubois and Knox counties and a low of 24.1 percent in 
                        Steuben County
                    . They exceeded the statewide mean primarily in the older, more developed counties of
                    southern Indiana, areas most removed from frontier conditions (Figure 2-A).
            Indiana's frontier expanded from southeast to northwest with the sale to rapidly arriving
                    pioneers of land newly acquired from the Indians, and by 1850 the frontier had statistically
                    disappeared from the state. The average population density of 27.2 persons per square mile surpassed
                    the two persons per square mile level suggested by Frederick 
                        Jackson
                     Turner as a threshold above which the frontier period ceased and even exceeded the
                    density of eighteen persons per square mile proposed as necessary for the beginning of successful
                    commercial agriculture.15
            
            
               
                  14 Numbers for Indiana that are referred to in the text are compiled from
                        the count of the microfilmed manuscript census returns. Figures for other states are from US.,
                            Seventh Census, 1850, Table XV, pp. xxxvi-xxxviii. Discrepancies will be
                        found between nativity totals in Indiana according to the manuscript count (Table 1) and those
                        published in Table XV of the 1850 census, with figures from the manuscript schedules higher in
                        all cases except for 
                            North Carolina
                        . Occasionally, skipped or double-counted pages were found on the microfilms.
                        Deciphering an individual's handwriting style and faded inks was also difficult.
                        Discrepancies in totals are not unusual; they even appear in the published 1850 census between
                        tables supposedly using the same counts. See Everett S. Lee and Anne S. Lee, "Internal

                    Immigrants native to other states formed the majority of settlers in the north, but in southern
                    counties, where statistically the frontier had passed years before, immigrants made up a smaller
                    portion of the population. Immigration as the leading component of growth in Indiana peaked during
                    the 1830s and was replaced by natural increase within the state. By the 1850s Indiana's
                    population had expanded to the point that the state was sending more migrants to other states than
                    it received.16 By midcentury settlers in southern Indiana had resided in the
                    state the longest, and they had more native Hoosier children or even grandchildren than did newly
                    arrived immigrants living elsewhere. Southern Indiana was thus the portion of the state first
                    settled,

                     most densely populated, and most distant temporally and
                    spatially from the state's frontier, and it was the area with a greater than average
                    percentage of its population native to Indiana.
            Of Indiana settlers born elsewhere in the 
                        United States
                     the majority were northerners who were native to areas east of the Mississippi River
                    and north of the 
                        Mason
                    -Dixon Line or the Ohio River. Northerners accounted for 55.6
                    percent of the non-native Hoosier, 
                        United States
                    -born population in 1850; southerners, those settlers born south of the 
                        Mason
                    -Dixon Line or the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River,
                    comprised 44.0 percent; and the balance of 0.4 percent came from west of the Mississippi River. The
                    distribution of northerners and southerners is shown in Figure 2-A. Northerners eclipsed southerners
                    in the north and southeastern corner while southerners were strong in the southern and south central
                    areas of Indiana. The boundary between this northern-southern division within the state was actually
                    a transition zone across the state's middle section where counties were either slightly
                    above or below the average nativity percentages.
            Few natives of New 
                        England
                     resided in Indiana according to the 1850 census, as only 11,165 or 2.7 percent of the
                    settlers born in the 
                        United States
                     exclusive of Indiana were Yankees. This was far less than the 10.3 percent average for
                    the entire Old Northwest, a figure that excludes the native-born residents of each respective state
                    in the same way that Hoosier natives were excluded from Indiana's percentage. Vermont
                    provided 3,296 natives to Indiana, more than any other state in New 
                        England
                    . Although Massachusetts had New 
                        England
                    's largest population, it ranked second as a supplier of settlers, followed by
                            
                  Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire
               ,
                    and 
                        Rhode Island
                    . Counties in which the number of New Englanders was above the statewide mean were
                    concentrated on the fringes of the state: near the northern border, in the southeastern corner, and
                    scattered counties along the Ohio and Wabash rivers (Figure 2-B). Yankee
                    population percentages ranged from a high of 13.1 percent in 
                        Lake County
                     to a low of 0.24 percent in 
                        Monroe County
                    , where only ten migrants lived. Central Indiana usually had less than the average
                    number of New Englanders. No maps of distributions from individual New 
                        England
                     states have been included because of their statistically minor significance, but each
                    state's pattern displays a high degree of similarity to that of the entire region.
            In 1850 not quite one fifth of Indiana's non-native Hoosier and non-foreign-born population
                    came from the three Middle Atlantic states, with Pennsylvania supplying 11.6 percent, New

                     York providing 6.3 percent, and 
                        New Jersey
                     accounting for 2.0 percent. Indiana's Middle Atlantic total of 19.9 percent
                    was below that of every other state in the Old Northwest and was less than half of the entire
                    region's average of 42.4 percent. Migrants from the Middle Atlantic states concentrated in
                    two areas of Indiana—the northern third and the southeastern corner—plus two
                    counties along the Ohio River (Figure 2-B). They were more ubiquitous than the
                    map might suggest as only twenty counties, mostly in the southwest and west center, had less than 10
                    percent of their settlers born in the region. Percentages ranged from a maximum of 49.2 percent of 
                        Lake County
                    's population to a minimum of 3.3 percent in 
                        Monroe County
                    . Those born in the Middle Atlantic states as a region and in the state of Pennsylvania
                    were almost identically distributed in the southeast and northern half of Indiana (Figures 2-B and
                    3-A). Natives of 
                        New York
                     settled closer to the northern border and in fewer southeastern counties than did
                    Pennsylvanians (Figure 3-A). The nativity concentration maps for New Yorkers and New Englanders are
                    quite similar, raising the possibility of greater cultural and migratory connections between
                    settlers from these two areas than between New Yorkers and Pennsylvanians (Figures 2-B and 3-A).
            By 1850 southern-born settlers in the Hoosier state comprised 44.0 percent of the population that was
                    born in the 
                        United States
                     exclusive of Indiana, far above the average of 28.3 percent for the Old Northwest as a
                    whole. No state in the Old Northwest had a greater proportion of its population native to the South
                    in 1850; Illinois came closest with 34.8 percent. No state in the Old Northwest had a larger number
                    of southern natives in 1850; Ohio came closest with 150,845–28,000 shy of
                    Indiana's figure of 178,847. The south central section of the state was the most heavily
                    southern, reaching a maximum of 91.5 percent of the non-native Hoosier, 
                        United States
                    -born population in Monroe and Orange counties (Figure 2-A). Few southerners populated
                    northeastern Indiana where the lowest value of 1.8 percent was found in 
                        Steuben County
                    . Southerners were the first pioneers in the state, settling initially in the south
                    along the Ohio River and then moving northward into the interior.
                    "Because so much of the state was thus preempted by southerners, fewer migrants from the
                    Middle and New

                     states moved directly to Indiana during the period from 1800 to 1840, when much of the
                    state passed from a wilderness to an established society.17 This fact made
                    southerners extremely important in the development of the state.

            Four states—
                  Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina
               , and 
                        Tennessee
                    —accounted for most of the southern settlers in Indiana. Natives of Kentucky
                    surpassed all other southerners in number (70,552) and percentage (17.3); and they and natives of
                    the South as a whole were distributed in a nearly identical pattern (Figures 3-B and 2-A). Large
                    numbers of Kentuckians settled in the southwestern half of Indiana, but in other areas they
                    comprised only a small part of the population. Extremes of settlement ranged from a high of 61.8
                    percent of the non-native Hoosier, 
                        United States
                    -born population in 
                        Perry County
                     to a low of 0.15 percent in 
                        DeKalb
                     County. Virginia provided the second largest number and percentage of southerners,
                    43,288 and 10.6 respectively. They were dispersed throughout Indiana—in the south center,
                    in the northwest, and across the middle of the state; yet, they did not dominate in southeastern and
                    southwestern Indiana where southerners generally were strong. By 1850 natives of 
                        North Carolina
                     living in the state totaled 32,879 or 8.1 percent of the non-native Hoosier, 
                        United States
                    -born population, ranking third among southern states. North Carolinians concentrated in
                    southwestern and east central Indiana but were conspicuously absent from the southeast (Figure 4-A).
                    Many Quakers were among the native North Carolinians living in east central Indiana, including 1,200
                    who moved directly from piedmont 
                        North Carolina
                     to 
                        Richmond
                     in 
                        Wayne County
                     between 1809 and 1819.18 Tennessee supplied the fourth largest
                    number and percentage of southerners, 13,087 migrants forming 3.2 percent of the 
                        United States
                    -born but non-native Hoosier population. Concentrated in southern Indiana, Tennesseans
                    were more confined to the southwestern quarter but also inhabited a northward spur in the center
                    (Figure 4-A).
            Hoosier residents native to other states in the Old Northwest totaled 134,252 in 1850, 33.0 percent
                    of those born in the 
                        United States
                     exclusive of Indiana. The largest number and percentage (127,845 and 31.4 percent) were
                    born in 
                        Ohio
                    , and counties having natives of the Old Northwest and of Ohio that exceeded the mean
                    values were distributed almost identically in northern Indiana (Figure 4-B). By the time

                    contained the majority of the state's high quality, unsettled land, and most Ohio emigrants
                    chose to settle there. 
                        Adams County
                     in the northeast had the largest percentage of Buckeye natives (63.9 percent), and the
                    south central county of Orange had the smallest (1.8 percent). Of the states in the Old Northwest
                    Illinois supplied the next largest number of Indiana immigrants, with 4,344 settlers constituting
                    1.1 percent of the non-native Hoosier, 
                        United States
                    -born population. They concentrated along the western border of Indiana (Figure 4-B).
                    The largest percentage of Illinois natives was found in 
                        Posey County
                    , with 9.6 percent, and the smallest, less than 0.1 percent, in 
                        Wells County
                    , where two migrants resided. 
                  Michigan, Wisconsin
               , and Minnesota
                    together supplied 2,066 natives, over 90 percent coming from 
                        Michigan
                    .
            Because Ohio and Illinois were both "western" states, the nativity of their
                    residents differed from states to the east that had more European-born or homegrown populations.
                    Like Indiana, Ohio and Illinois straddled the major migration paths traversed by the westward-moving
                    natives of New 
                        England
                    , Middle Atlantic, and southern regions. Also like Indiana, Ohio and Illinois received a
                    heavy influx of 
                        United States
                    -born migrants after 1800, with many coming from 
                  Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York
               , and 
                        Kentucky
                    . In 1850, 71.6 percent of Ohio residents born outside their state but within the 
                        United States
                     were natives of the North and 28.2 percent came from the South; among Illinoisans in
                    the same category 62.8 percent hailed from the North and 33.7 percent from the South.19 Cultures from various areas of the East mixed in

                     the mean is merely an average score, those counties with
                    percentages of migrants at least one standard deviation greater than the statewide mean have been
                    defined as dominated by a regional nativity group. For each region the arithmetic mean and the value
                    one standard deviation above the mean are, respectively: New 
                        England
                    , 2.7 percent and 5.3 percent; Middle Atlantic, 19.9 percent and 30.2 percent; South,
                    44.0 percent and 69.4 percent; Old Northwest, 33.0 percent and 50.3 percent. Dominance of one
                    regional nativity group in a county does not necessarily exclude all others, for a Yankee-dominated
                    county could have as much as 94.6 percent of its non-native Hoosier, 
                        United States
                    -born population originating elsewhere while a southern dominated county could have as
                    much as 30.5 percent of its population originating in the other three regions. Occasionally, two
                    regional nativity groups dominated in the same county.
            Figure 5 illustrates the distribution by county of regional nativity greater than one standard
                    deviation above the mean. A north-south pattern of sources of origin that is roughly similar to the
                    latitudinal position of regional sources of origin is revealed. Pioneers born in the south resided
                    primarily in southwestern and south central Indiana, areas closest to their former homes. Most
                    northerners settled in the north, with New 
                        Eng-
                    landers along the Michigan border and Middle Atlantic migrants there or slightly to the
                    south. Those settlers having birthplaces in the Old Northwest exclusive of Indiana also clustered in
                    the northern half of the state. The central area of Indiana was a transition zone where no single
                    regional nativity group dominated.
            Numerous explanations for the conspicuous north-south pattern of settlement groups in the Old
                    Northwest and the ascendancy of certain groups in particular areas have been advanced, ranging from
                    historical and political conditions to cultural connections.21 Portions of
                    Indiana may have been especially attractive to certain immigrants because of similarities in
                    climate, vegetation, and agriculture to the settlers' old homes.22 Many
                    were enticed to the state by the opportunity it offered individuals

                to improve their economic and social status. Knowledge of Indiana's frontier
                    gained by personal experience, gathered through study, or communicated by relatives or former
                    neighbors living there was a potent drawing force. Many factors that influenced the sequence of
                    settlement expansion in Indiana affected the distribution of nativity groups, including the dates of
                    Indian land cessions, dates of county formation, population densities by 1850, latitudinal and
                    frontier origins of pioneers, the time of interest in migration, and the impact that available
                    transportation routes had on the accessibility of different parts of the state.
            Before pioneers could legally settle in Indiana, Indian-owned lands had to be ceded. In 1795 Indians
                    possessed all of Indiana 
                    
                  FIGURE 6. DATE OF INDIAN LAND CESSIONS IN INDIANA
                  
                except a triangular slice along the Ohio border, a region surrounding 
                        Vincennes
                    , and a parcel nearly coincident with today's 
                        Clark County
                     (Figure 6). A series of treaties in the first decade of the new century caused more
                    land to be vacated, including a strip along the Ohio River, a portion of the
                    southeast, and two large sections immediately to the north of these. Then in 1818 the "New
                    Purchase," comprising most of the state's midsection, was sold to the federal
                    government, quickly surveyed, placed on the market, and organized into counties. Territory along the
                    Wabash River and at the Michigan border was surrendered in 1826. A treaty two years later opened
                    lands in the northeast, and the northwest was transferred to the government in 1832.  Only the small Miami Reserve remained. Part of this remnant was pared
                    off in 1834 and the rest relinquished in 1840, bringing to an end undisputed Indian land
                        ownership.23
            
            Territory ceded to the 
                        United States
                     by the Indians became part of the public domain, most of which was surveyed and sold by
                    the General Land Office. Settlers and speculators could purchase these acres at regional land
                    offices throughout the state. Each land office district contained a sales agency at a town
                    accessible to the incoming pioneers and close enough to the frontier to stay abreast of legal, but
                    not always actual, settlement. Here the land contract was completed and full payment or down payment
                    received. As more Indian territory was obtained and surveyed, new agencies opened to sell the
                    acreage. Because land nearest to the frontier was in greatest demand, offices there were usually
                    busiest during their first years; then, new agencies opening closer to the northward moving frontier
                    in turn became the most active.24 The first offices in Indiana appeared in the
                    south shortly after 1800; by 1833 the last one had been established in the northwest.
                    Indiana's frontier moved from south to north, following the sequence of land cessions,
                    surveys, market offerings, and purchases.
            Generally, the establishment of counties came as a fairly rapid response to the development of
                    frontier areas and the administrative problems created by the growing population and the need to
                    provide legal services close to the pioneers.25 The dates of county organization
                    indicate Indiana's settlement expansion, although numerous boundary adjustments subsequent
                    to initial formation occurred as new counties were carved from old ones or remnants of Indian lands
                    were surrendered. For example, 
                        Ohio County
                     (formed in 1844) and 
                        Brown County
                     (1836) appeared fifteen to forty years after their neighbors while Howard and Tip-ton
                    counties (1844), created from the Miami Indian Reserve, followed the establishment of nearby
                    counties by twelve to fifteen years.26

                     (Figure 7-A). At that time the recently obtained land in the
                    southern interior was only thinly settled, and areas northward remained Indian territory. From 1815
                    to 1824 thirty-eight more counties emerged in the south as land was ceded and population increased.
                    Two groups of counties were created in the newly opened north central and extreme northern
                    territories between 1825 and 1834. As yet not subdivided were the sparsely peopled areas in the
                    north, but in 1835 the legislature decided to act before settlement pressure reached high levels and
                    established fourteen counties there. All other counties were formed by 1844, with the exception of 
                        Newton
                     (1859).27 The gradual creation of Indiana's counties
                    followed the trend of settlement and population growth as it moved from south to north and advanced
                    more rapidly in some areas than others.
            Population densities in Indiana counties by 1850 indicate the various levels of development in the
                    state and the expansion of the frontier. Figure 7-B designates densities that are two categories
                    above and two below the state mean of 27.2 persons per square mile. The highest densities, including
                    a maximum of 99.8 in 
                        Floyd County
                    , existed in the areas of the southeast that were settled earliest. Most of central
                    Indiana had densities in the first category above the average, while the northeastern and
                    southwestern portions were in the first category below the mean. The last section of the state to
                    grow was the northwest where Jasper and Benton counties still had fewer than four persons per square
                    mile in 1850. The presence of large towns or cities gave some counties higher density values than
                    neighboring rural areas, as did 
                        Indianapolis
                     for 
                        Marion County
                    , but generally places that had been settled the longest achieved the highest densities
                    through a combination of population growth and the establishment of farms on remaining empty lands.
            Cession of Indian lands, sales to pioneers, formation of counties, and expansion of population were
                    four nearly simultaneous events in most cases; however, growth did not always occur once lands were
                    available for purchase and counties had been formed. For example, the map of population densities
                    (Figure 7-B) shows the southwestern and northeastern portions of the state at similar levels in
                    1850. The southwestern lands had been obtained and offered for sale between 1795 and 1809; they were
                    organized into counties from 1801 to 1825. Indians ceded the lands in the northeast from 1818
                    through 1832, and counties were formed between 1824 and 1836. In the southwest, settlement to the
                        
                  
                     27

                     state's average took from twenty-five to fifty years
                    while in the northeast it required only eighteen to twenty-five years. The northeast filled rapidly
                    after it was open to settlement; although the southwest had been on the market for a long time, it
                    grew slowly.28
            
            The distribution of nativity groups in Indiana provides some supporting evidence for the oft-stated
                    tendency of pioneers to migrate westward along latitude lines from home states near the frontier to
                    newer frontiers.29 Natives of northern areas settled northern Indiana;
                    southerners settled southern Indiana (Figure 2-A). New Englanders selected land farther north than
                    Middle Atlantic natives (Figure 2-B), reflecting the relative locations of their East Coast origins.
                    Vermont was on New 
                        England
                    's agricultural frontier and provided the largest number of Yankees to Indiana.
                    Pennsylvania led all Middle Atlantic states as a source of Hoosier migrants (Figure 3-A). Its large
                    western section was a recent frontier located to the east of northern Indiana. Kentuckians, the
                    largest southern group of immigrants 
                  
                     28 Many factors probably contributed to the slower settlement of
                            southwestern Indiana. The rugged topography of the Crawford Upland and the hills within the
                            Wabash Lowland may have limited contact with southeastern Indiana, and pioneers entering via
                            the Wabash River system were more likely to follow the watercourses deeper into the
                            interior, once the lowlands were filled, rather than settle the empty hill lands. The
                            generally poor soils were derived primarily from the bedrock beneath them although a thin
                            layer of glacial material covered the lowland areas; upland soils were the least fertile and
                            suffered serious slope erosion while the more fertile lowland areas were subject to
                            flooding. The land was heavily clothed in an oak-hickory forest that often left the soil
                            acidic. L#2 I. Dillon and Edward E. Lyon, eds., Indiana: Crossroads of

                            roads and the Wabash River system, coupled with a general lack of towns and villages, made
                            it difficult to attract and retain large numbers of settlers after an initial spurt of

                            sales and settlement came to a near halt with the economic crisis of 1819, and by the time
                            regular conditions returned in the mid-1820s the frontier had moved beyond southwestern
                            Indiana. Hart, "The Spread of the Frontier and the Growth of Population,"
                            73–74, 77–80; Rohrbough, "The Land Office Business in
                            Indiana," 49–51. Southwestern Indiana became a settlement backwater
                            because cheaper, flatter, more accessible, and more fertile land within and outside of the
                            state attracted most pioneers. By 1850 Indiana counties with the lowest farmland value were
                            concentrated in the southwest, an example of the poor conditions and slow development
                            experienced by this region. Power, Planting Corn Belt Culture,

                     (Figure 3-B), moved west and northwest from the first
                    trans-Appalachian frontier to nearby areas of southern Indiana. In 1850 
                        Virginia
                    , which supplied the second largest number of southerners, included the recent frontier
                    area that would become West 
                        Virginia
                    . Virginia and West Virginia are slightly farther north than 
                        Kentucky
                    , and their natives settled land in central Indiana (Figure 3-B). Ohio natives migrated
                    westward from the last frontiers in northern Ohio to open lands in central and northern Indiana
                    (Figure 4-B). The recency of frontier conditions in states that provided the most Hoosier pioneers
                    suggests that generations of migrants possessed a "frontiering mentality" that
                    encouraged recurrent westward movement to the edges of settlement.30
            
            Pioneers may have settled in a certain part of Indiana because land was available when they were
                    ready to move to the frontier. The supply of cheap, open land in eastern states ran out at different
                    times. Kentuckians lived closest to Indiana in the early 1800s, farther west than other major
                    populations. When empty land in their state became too limited, too expensive, or too distant, they
                    moved across the Ohio River into southern Indiana, the first area ceded by the
                    Indians and available for settlement. By the time desirable acreage in western 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , western 
                        New York
                    , and Ohio was exhausted, southern Indiana was no longer frontier territory. Middle
                    Atlantic migrants found recently ceded central and northern Indiana the most attractive. Ohio
                    natives discovered the same situation when they looked for empty land in Indiana, a fact which
                    explains their concentration in the north rather than in the closer eastern sections of the Hoosier
                    state. New Englanders who headed west early could only settle in southeastern Indiana while later
                    arrivals selected land far north on the state's last major frontier.
            The transportation network made portions of Indiana more accessible to certain migrant groups than to
                    others. Major migration paths followed an east-west alignment (Figure 8). Some routes, such as the
                    Great Lakes and the westward flowing Ohio River, naturally aided movement to
                    western frontiers, while others, such as the 
                        Erie
                     Canal and the National Road, were built partially in response to this movement and then
                    served to intensify

                     it.31 Immigrants arrived at the
                        Ohio River via roads to the stream and its tributaries in western 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , western 
                        Virginia
                    , and Kentucky or floated down the tributaries themselves. The river deposited these
                    mostly southern migrants along the southern border of Indiana, whence they moved northward into the
                    interior by road or river to about the level of the National Road (Figure 2-A). Some natives of
                    Middle Atlantic and New 
                        England
                     states reached southern Indiana this way, but their numbers were few (Figure 2-B). The
                    National Road crossed Pennsylvania and Ohio en route between 
                  Cumberland, Maryland
               , and
                    the west; thus, it was available for migrants from those three states. Researchers have noted that
                    the road did not enter central Indiana until settlement was well underway.32
                    Surveys for the route began on the eastern border of Indiana in 1827, and the road finally reached 
                        Terre Haute
                     in the west by 1836.33 In the mid-1830s population densities in
                    counties along the road were all above frontier levels, ranging from 51.7 persons per square mile in
                    the east to 9.9 in the west. As late as 1838 M. H. Jenks wrote from 
                        Richmond
                    , in eastern Indiana, that "the National Road passes through this place but it
                    is not yet finished, nor travelled . . . ."34 Migrants from
                    Pennsylvania and Ohio probably followed the road as far west as possible, but they settled in
                    central and northern Indiana because those areas were on the frontier, coincidentally placing them
                    close to the National Road (Figures 3-A and 4-B). New Yorkers traveled on the 
                        Erie
                     Canal, which crossed their state, and New Englanders could reach the canal from land
                    routes or by way of coastal vessels and the Hudson River. From 
                        Buffalo
                    , New Yorkers and New Englanders could travel west on lake boats or follow land routes
                    parallel to Lake 
                        Erie
                    . Both groups concentrated in northern Indiana, nearest to the land and water routes
                    that emanated from the ports of 
                        Toledo
                     and 
                        Detroit
                     (Figures 3-A and 2-B). If suitable lands were present in areas served by each route and
                    no prior commitments to join family members or former neighbors influenced the pioneers'
                    choice of location, they probably selected the closest acres rather than extending the difficult and
                    costly journey farther.

            Why did the stream of pioneers from Kentucky continue westward into southern Illinois and Missouri
                    rather than advancing farther north into central and northern Indiana? Why did Yankees bypass the
                    fairly empty lands remaining in southwestern and parts of northern Indiana for farms in
                            
                  Michigan, Wisconsin
               , and northern 
                        Illinois
                    ? Because the developing transportation network made traveling for longer distances
                    easier, faster, and cheaper, immigrants may have preferred moving farther into the frontier to
                    settling on the lands that were still available in Indiana. Migrants may have perceived greater
                    opportunities for better lands, economic improvement, and social advancement in newer frontier
                    states, or such states may have been more like the old home in climate, agriculture, politics, and
                    culture. The level of conflict or cooperation among regional nativity groups residing in Indiana
                    likely affected the state's attractiveness.35 Indiana's
                    reputation repulsed some pioneers—the state was backward, uncouth, swampy, diseased,
                    infertile—but others saw it in an inviting light—advancing, civilized,
                    well-watered, healthful, productive.36 These and other factors thus resulted in
                    significant differences in the number and areal distribution of settlement groups in Indiana in
                    1850.
            Concentrations of migrants from various regions or states affected the culture of the sections of
                    Indiana in which they settled, but the large number of native Hoosiers in the total population makes
                    it difficult to determine the influence of regional cultures in Indiana. States east of the
                    Appalachians or south of the Ohio River are usually placed into New 
                        England
                    , Middle Atlantic, or southern regions, although many argue that the South should be
                    further divided into Upland/Interior and Lowland/Tidewater zones.37 Each
                    regional category exhibits separate, distinctive cultural elements of speech, religion,

                     architecture, and economy.38 Indiana
                    received migrants from all three regions, and native-born Hoosiers reflected the cultural
                    differences brought to the state by their parents. Although one might conclude that the degree of
                    cultural variation in the state in 1850 was proportional to the regional nativity percentages, the
                    southern impact on Indiana was probably greater than numbers alone indicate. Southerners arrived in
                    the state in large numbers prior to the other regional groups; therefore, by 1850 native-born
                    Hoosiers were most likely to be descendants of southerners and influenced by southern culture. The
                    mapped patterns of native-born Hoosiers and southerners above the mean indicate a spatial
                    correlation between the two groups, as both were concentrated in southern Indiana (Figure 2-A).
                    Southern natives thus became culturally dominant in the state at least in part because they arrived
                    first and were present during the crucial early years of societal development. Those settlers
                    influenced by southerners—settlers including most native-born
                    Hoosiers—nurtured and expanded this culture. Hoosiers born in Indiana who had parents
                    from the New 
                        England
                     or Middle Atlantic states enlarged the cultural influence of those two regions, but
                    their influence was probably less than that of the southerners since they arrived later and in
                    smaller numbers.
            Nativity data from the 1850 manuscript census provide significant information relevant to
                    Indiana's history. A study of the birthplaces of residents in Indiana counties, for
                    example, complements similar nativity studies of 
                  Texas, Vermont, Illinois, Oregon

            Special Numbers at the Picnic: The Little York Sunday School Picnic and Homecoming
            
                    Donald Beikman
                    ∗
                
            
                    The Setting
                
            Mayfield's Grove lay just outside Little York, the only village in the northeasternmost
                    township of southern Indiana's 
                        Washington County
                    . For six decades, from 1902 to 1964, the grove was the site of the Little York Sunday
                    School Picnic and Homecoming, held annually on the first Saturday in August. Considered a red-letter
                    day by young and old alike, this Saturday in midsummer could brighten a face and quicken a step as
                    could no other religious or national holiday. The Christian church at Little York sponsored the
                    event, and at noon its members and its guests assembled for the principal church dinner of the year.
                    Thousands, however, attended the picnic to visit with friends and relatives and to enjoy the
                    program. There were speeches, or at least a few words, by each attending dignitary and music by He
                    and drum, stringed instrument, and the wind band engaged for the day. In addition, there were the
                    gospel songs of the participating Sunday schools.
            Terrain, rather than township or county line, determined in large part those who attended the Little
                    York Sunday School Picnic and Homecoming. Established in 1831, the village of Little York was laid
                    out on the western fringe of the Scottsburg Lowland, a plain running north and south for some ninety
                    miles between the Muscatatuck Regional Slope to the east and the 
                        Norman
                     Upland to the west. The upland, the rim of which is clearly visible from the town,
                    rises some four hundred feet above 
                  
                     ∗ Donald Beikman is associate professor of music,
                            University of 
                        Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
                     .
               
                     the lowland, and any route from the eastern to the western side
                    of the township must cross the intervening Knobs.1 In former times passage by
                    horse-drawn wagon and buggy must have been arduous, and even during the last decades of the
                    twentieth century the community still turns eastward to Scott County to meet most of its needs.
                    Earlier in Little York's history residents seldom had to travel any appreciable distance
                    for the goods and services that they needed. Most could be had in the hometown. The village had its
                    miller and milliner, its barber and blacksmith, its carpenter, cooper, and cobbler. By 1920 it had
                    no fewer than four general stores and as many lodges, a canning factory, a restaurant, a hotel, and
                    a school.2 Only one grocery and a single lodge survive, and were it not for the
                    post office, the two churches, and the roads, there would now be virtually no visible remnant of the
                    past.
            Little York's Methodist congregation dates from 1844, its Christian congregation from 1849.
                    In 1883 the Christians raised a new house of worship, and in the following year the Methodists built
                    a new church.3 Both buildings were typical of the white clapboard meetinghouses
                    that once dotted the countryside. The only room generally measured no more than thirty-five by forty
                    feet and had four windows along each side, a panel door or two at the back, and a solid wall at the
                    front. A low platform, usually about fifteen feet in width, ran across the front of the room and
                    held the pulpit, a chair for the minister, and pews for a choir. There were wood stoves for heat and
                    kerosene lamps for light, and there was a reed organ or a piano to accompany the singing. At Sunday
                    school there were as many classes as were feasible. If the congregation was small, the adults met in
                    one corner and the children in another. If the congregation was large, the young people met
                    separately, and the smaller children were possibly removed to a spot of their own. In and around
                    Little York the one-room church, like the one-room school, is now a rarity, for most of the churches
                    have been recently remodeled and enlarged. Today it is unusual to find a class without its own
                    separate room or cubicle.
            Sunday school at the Little York Christian Church has changed remarkably little during the last six
                    decades. The school

                     meets on Sunday morning in the sanctuary at half past nine.
                    There is a prelude, and at the conclusion of the two opening hymns, the superintendent leads a
                    responsive reading. After the prayer hymn and superintentent's prayer, the school breaks up
                    into nine classes. The Christian church building was remodeled in 1948 and enlarged in 1964, and
                    today seven classes have separate rooms. The adults' and men's classes, however,
                    still meet in opposite corners of the sanctuary. On August 8, 1982, the Sunday after the first
                    Saturday in the month, the attendance was ninety-two. The records of the school show that twenty-six
                    people attended Sunday school on August 4, 1872, sixty-five on August 3, 1873, and 130 on August 3,
                    1969. The whereabouts of the records for the picnic years are, unfortunately, not known. In former
                    times, however, newspapers sometimes gave attendance figures, and the

                    Democrat noted that on July 27, 1913, the Sunday before the picnic, there were 134
                    at Sunday school and that the collection was $1.27.4
            
            The Little York Sunday School Picnic and Homecoming was essentially the handiwork of the
                    superintendents in charge of the Sunday school at the Christian church. Although there was a picnic
                    committee, much of the actual planning and arranging fell to the superintendents: Elmer Lester
                    (1912–1929), Carl McCoskey (1929–1941), Lee 
                        Jackson
                     (1941–1946), and William Blunt (1946–1965). These men sought out
                    effective orators and qualified judges. They had posters printed. They wrote announcements for the
                    newspapers, and they placed orders for ground meat and soft drinks. They recorded disbursements and
                    receipts. They compiled lists, and they undoubtedly had notes to keep from one year to the next.
                    Blunt, the last superintendent to oversee a picnic, died in 1979, and among his effects were a few
                    papers having to do with the event.5
            
            Although the picnic was open to any Sunday school, the superintendents did send a number of
                    invitations. Among Blunt's

                     memoranda is the wording on one such letter, presumably that
                    mailed in 1952 or 1958. 
                        Your Bible School is invited to attend the Little York Sunday School Picnic and Home Coming
                            to be held in the Mayfield Grove at Little York Sat. Aug 2.
                        
                     Come, if possible in a delegation. Bring special numbers—Adult
                            and Junior Choirs.
                     The distinction between superintendent and Sunday school, on the one hand, and minister and
                    church, on the other, was easily and naturally, but significantly, drawn; and as the invitation
                    emphasizes, delegations and special numbers were part and parcel of the picnic. One of
                    Blunt's papers lists the twenty-five schools invited in 1955. Another lists twenty-nine
                    schools and still another twenty-six. Neither carries a date, but internal evidence suggests that
                    the first was compiled sometime in the late 1940s, the second sometime in the early 1960s. The names
                    of eighteen Sunday schools appear on each of the three lists, and these schools may well have been
                    the backbone of the picnic. The other local schools, Little York Methodist, Mt. Eden Christian
                    (established 1866), and 
                        Mt. Carmel
                     United Brethren (1856), are, of course, among the eighteen. Zoah Christian (1853) and
                    Mt. Zion United Brethren (1855) to the east in Scott County are also within the immediate vicinity
                    and appear on each list. Seven Scott County schools invited to attend the picinic belong to other
                    neighborhoods: Austin Christian (1869), Fairview Christian (1882), Wesley Chapel Methodist (1852), 
                        Lexington
                     Christian (1839), Bethel Baptist (1835), 
                        Vienna
                     Baptist (1852), and New 
                        Providence
                     Baptist (1887). To the north in 
                        Jackson County
                     were Bethany Baptist (1867) and, at Tampico, Russell Chapel Methodist (1823), Tampico
                    Christian (1868), and Tampico Baptist (1907).6 Only two other 
                        Washington County
                     schools are listed: the one, Delaney Presbyterian (1904), is just south of the 
                        Jackson County
                     line and the other, Bunker Hill Christian (1842), is the only upland school in the set
                    of eighteen.7
            
            
               
                  6 In 1907 
                            Mt. Pleasant
                         Baptist Church (1829) and Freedom Baptist (1836–1840) merged, taking the
                        name Tampico Baptist. Down Memory Lane: Tampico Baptist Church,

            In addition to the eighteen Sunday schools that are listed on all three extant rosters, nineteen
                    schools appear on but one or two of the lists. Six of these are in Scott County: Austin Methodist
                    (1859); 
                        New Harmony
                     Baptist (1879); Scottsburg Christian (1882), located at the county seat; Kimberlin
                    Creek Baptist (1849); New Chapel Methodist (1886); and 
                        Vienna
                     Methodist (1860). Three—
                        Vallonia
                     Christian (1860), Driftwood Christian (1839), and Crothersville Christian
                    (1905)—are in 
                        Jackson County
                    . Blue Lick Christian (1860) and Hebron Presbyterian (1894)8 are in 
                        Clark County
                    , and 
                        Syria
                     Christian (1820) is in 
                        Orange County
                    . No fewer than seven 
                        Washington County
                     Sunday schools appear in this set of nineteen. 
                        Salem
                     Christian (1842) at the county seat is at the center of the county; Campbellsburg
                    Christian (1854) and Mt. Tabor (1840) are to the northwest; and 
                        Pekin
                     Christian (1860) is to the south. Canton Christian (1890) and West Point Methodist
                    (1861) are to the east, toward Little York. The nineteenth school, Mt. Hebron Methodist Evangelical
                    (1870s), is in Gibson township. It had, however, no regularly scheduled services between 1940 and
                    1968.
            Two observations are significant. First, the Little York Christian Church apparently did not perceive
                    the Sunday schools in the larger county seat churches as kindred. While the schools of the Christian
                    churches at Scottsburg and 
                        Salem
                     did receive invitations, they do not seem to have received one every year. The Sunday
                    schools of other denominations in the county seat towns do not appear on any list. Moreover, the
                    distance between the sponsoring school and one school to have an invitation in 1955, 
                        Syria
                     Christian in 
                        Orange County
                    , is thirty-six miles. 
                        Brownstown
                    , the county seat of 
                        Jackson County
                    , lies at less than half this distance from Little York, but there is no evidence that
                    its schools were ever sent a letter. Second, Little York considered the majority of the Sunday
                    schools in 
                        Washington County
                     as remote. In part because of the terrain, they were to be found, in the minds of the
                    residents of Little York, almost in another part of the state.
            Few Sunday schools actually sent official delegations to the Little York picnic. West Point, Mt.
                    Hebron, Delaney, and two

                     8 The Sunday schools invited in 1955 include that of a Hebron
                            Christian Church at Henryville. The inhabitants of this town do not recall such a church and
                            suggest that it was the Sunday school at Hebron Presbyterian Church that was invited.

                     other schools came in 1910.9 In the
                    following year Mt. Hebron, 
                        Mt. Carmel
                    , Tampico, Delaney, and Crothersville were represented, and in 1943 Mt. Eden, Mt.
                    Carkel, Russell Chapel, Tampico Baptist, Tampico Christian, Bethany, Bethel, Zoah, and Bunker Hill
                    attended. For four other years there are only numbers: ten schools in 1939, nine in 1914 and 1945,
                    and seven in 1946. In 1918 only Tampico and Russell Chapel brought special numbers.
            Mayfield's Grove, consisting of ten to twelve acres of beech trees, sheltered the annual
                    Little York Sunday School Picnic and Homecoming. A weather-beaten stage, the speaker's
                    stand, stood from one year to the next well inside the southeastern corner of the site, but on
                    picnic day it was resplendent with bunting. The stage was not large. In addition to the reed organ
                    of the earlier years or the piano of the later years—brought from the Christian church to
                    accompany the singing—it might have held, in a pinch, as many as twenty-five standing
                    adults and twenty-five song-books. The church pews were also brought out for the day, and these,
                    together with several makeshift plank benches, were ranged in front of the stage. There was never
                    enough seating, and most people stood to listen to the program or milled about renewing first one
                    acquaintance and then another. A space to the right of the rows of benches was reserved initially
                    for the buggies and afterward for the automobiles of the infirm. Inasmuch as a public address system
                    was not in use until 1934, much of what was said or sung in previous years must have been, despite
                    the best efforts of speakers and singers alike, all but inaudible at any distance from the stage.
            Running along the far edge of the area in front of the stage, well behind the last row of pews, were
                    the rectangular plank counters of the sandwich, soft drink, and ice cream stands. These stands were,
                    like the stage, more or less permanent constructions, and on the first Saturday in August they were
                    covered with white cloths. Superintendent Blunt's memoranda for 1962, a year in which
                    attendance was estimated at seven hundred, show that the three stands cleared $141.45, to
                    which must be added the $25.00 fee of the picnic's only concessionaire, Tom
                    Baldwin. At his booth Baldwin had balloons in assorted colors for the very young and buttons with
                    snappy sayings and a hundred

                other gewgaws that seemingly fascinate older children. When Blunt subtracted expenses to
                    the amount of $54.00, a figure which included the $20.00 paid to A. E.
                    Baker's band and the $2.00 allocated for decorating the speaker's
                    stand, he found that his Sunday school had realized a profit of $112.45 on its picnic.
            In the early years of the Little York Picnic and Homecoming members of the various Sunday schools met
                    early in the morning on the first Saturday in August, boarded wagons decorated for the occasion, and
                    departed for Mayfield's Grove; in 1914 the sponsor was prepared to give one dollar to each
                    school coming in a delegation wagon.10 With the advent of the automobile,
                    however, people began gathering inside the grove itself to form delegations. A banner displaying the
                    name of the Sunday school was raised, a sheepskin band struck up suitable music, and everyone, led
                    by the picnic marshal on horseback, moved forward. Each marcher was counted, and the largest
                    delegation of the day received a prize. Arriving at the southeastern corner of the grounds, the
                    delegation mounted the stage to sing its first special number. Each participating school took its
                    turn at this

                bit of pageantry, and the delegation, having arrived, disbanded, leaving its banner
                    standing upright at the back of the stage.
            Sheepskin bands were very much in evidence throughout the day. They played when each delegation
                    arrived and again when each adult choir marched to the speaker's stand to sing a special
                    number, and they could be counted on to strike up a tune or two whenever there was a lull in the
                    program. One church history records: "The Sheepskin Band consisted of James Elliott playing
                    fife and snare drum; Silas 
                        Monroe
                    , fife; John Hawn, bass drum; Ira 
                        Rutherford

                        Salem
                    , one whose members performed at numerous picnics, suggests that the repertoire may well
                    have been a traditional one. "Their music was probably never written in any book but handed
                    down from father to son. They didn't even know the name of some of the tunes until one day
                    an old army major told them the titles of such numbers as Jaybird, 
                        Concord
                     Bridge, Paul Revere's Ride, Picnic, Gilroy, and Yankee Squirrell
                        Hunter."12
            
            In addition to sheepskin bands, there was often a visiting wind band, and as soon as the
                    instrumentalists had eaten at the table set for them by the women of the sponsoring Sunday school,
                    they took their places and entertained the growing throng. In 1916 the Little York Christians
                    engaged the 
                        Pekin
                     Band, in 1917 the Dudleytown Concert Band. In 1918 a service flag of seventy-two stars
                    hung above the stage, and a military band of thirty pieces came from Camp Taylor, a temporary
                    training camp just outside 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               . In 1919 Will J. Nicholson, a musician
                    often heard at the picnic, led the

                     High School Band played in 1925, the Scottsburg High School Band in 1948. The 
                        Seymour
                     Band was heard in 1935. In 1939 the Morgan Packing Company of Austin, an important
                    employer for the entire area, sent its Drum and Bugle Corps, and in 1953 another band from Austin
                    performed. The Palmyra Modern Woodman Band played in 1926 and again in 1927, and in 1928 a band of
                    twenty-two pieces came from Jonesville.
            The featured band, having played its selections, departed, and the singing began in earnest. Although
                    until 1948 the Sunday schools sang competitively, the first to take the stage and to sing a special
                    number or two was never a contestant. The Little York Christians could not, of course, compete, but
                    they could lead the way. The numbers they brought were spirited pieces, effective curtain raisers,
                    and the first competing school knew that it already had the attention of many picnickers. Later,
                    when the final contestant had been heard and the three judges had withdrawn for consultation, the
                    sponsors would return with another rousing number.
            Contestants competed in five categories, with prizes awarded for quartets, duets, and solos as well
                    as for adult and junior choirs. In addition to the special number to be sung upon arrival, a school
                    could bring as many as five numbers; few brought more than three. The smaller schools did not always
                    have enough children to form a junior choir, and there was never more than an occasional solo. The
                    composition of the quartets varied, there being those of four women and those of four men as well as
                    those of two women and two men. There were always more duets than solos at the picnic, more quartets
                    than duets or junior choirs, and more adult choirs than quartets.
            The adult choirs were choirs in name only. Everyone who sang at Sunday school sang at the picnic, and
                    to all intents and purposes it was the school itself that stood on the stage, youngsters alongside
                    grownups. "Even as a very small girl," one woman writes, "I loved to sing
                    at the picnic with the big folks. Altho we usually always had a special as the young people of Mt.
                        Eden."13 Each school had a director, and in order to prepare
                    special numbers, members attended rehearsals. 
                        I audibly counted the time while the choir sang. I sang soprano, alto, tenor, and bass as
                            needed to assist and give confidence to any singer. Also our pianist would play the notes of
                            any one of the parts when needed by any singer. It was necessary that I use falsetto tones
                            at times when assisting some singer. Choir members were frequently encouraged to open their
                            mouths and speak distinctly but

                      to not try and steal the show by being louder than other singers. Our practice
                            sessions usually lasted for one hour. They were pleasant and business-like with no fooling
                            around. Singers were instructed to watch the director carefully and everyone was to keep the
                            proper sustained tone for every note. When I could feel vibrations in the church pews or
                            chairs as the choir sang, I was quite sure that they were doing about what I expected them
                            to do.14
                  
                     Rehearsals were held periodically for a few weeks prior to the picnic rather than year
                    round, for had there been no picnic, there would have been no occasion for special numbers and no
                    need for directors and rehearsals. Parenthetically, the quartets and duets were quite another
                    matter. They were much in demand for funerals and for church functions of one sort or another;
                    consequently, they sang intermittently throughout the year.
            The Sunday schools sang in the order in which they had arrived. At the appointed time—the
                    singing of the special number by the Little York Christians was the signal—the first
                    adult choir assembled to the east of the novelty stand. When all was ready and the school announced,
                    the sheepskin band began to play; as the choir made its way to the speaker's stand, the
                    singers of the second competing school were to be seen hastily converging upon the spot just
                    vacated. When the adults had been heard, the juniors sang. The quartets, duets, and solos that
                    followed did not

                     march to the stand and were never accorded the music of fife
                    and drum.
            There were three judges. None could be easily identified with any competing school, and each was
                    known to have a discriminating ear for music. The schools brought copies of their special numbers
                    for the judges, who followed the printed music closely during the singing. "The judges of
                    the singing contests based their decisions on such factors as type of song selected, harmony, tone
                    quality, balance of parts, spiritual message conveyed, resonance, expression, attack, distinct
                    pronunciation, volume of tone, reaction of the crowd listening, how well the pianist and the choir
                    director performed their functions, time."15 The judges, while
                    impartial, were not lenient, and the school taking the first prize proudly returned to sing an
                    encore.
            In 1945 the 
                        Salem
                    
                    Republican-Leader listed the prizes. "Best senior choir, $5
                    and $2; best junior choir, $3 and $1; best quartet, $2
                    and $1; best duet, $1; best solo, 50 cents. The Sunday school having the
                    largest delegation will receive $3, with $2 for second award. One dollar will
                    be awarded each Sunday school not receiving another prize. The best fife and drum band present will
                    receive $1."16 By 1945, however, serious questions had
                    arisen concerning the competition. The singing of sacred music for prize money had long been an
                    issue. More than one decision of the judges had been an occasion for hard feelings, and it had not
                    gone unnoticed that some schools, notably Mt. Eden and Tampico Baptist, won prizes and others did
                    not. In 1948 the Little York Christians discontinued the competition, and the 
                        Salem
                    
                    Democrat announced "$2.00 will be given to each Sunday School
                    marching with banner and singing two songs, or $3.00 for each school marching with a
                    banner, singing two songs and a quartet or duet. $2.00 for the largest delegation;
                    $1.00 for the second largest delegation. $1.00 will be given to each fife and
                    drum band present."17 Apparently there were no further changes, for if
                    the prize for the fife and drum bands is deleted, the prize list is the same as that given on the
                    window cards printed for 1962.
            Although the singing of the special numbers undoubtedly drew many people, the speaker was easily the
                    chief attraction at many a picnic. The orators were a mixed bag. The Reverend J. A. Brown of Lyons
                    spoke in 1928, the Reverend Ira M. Boswell of 
                        Louisville
                     in 1938, and the Reverend Amos L. Boren of

                     in 1941. The president of nearby 
                        Hanover
                     College, Dr. William A. Millis, came in 1918. Frank P. Manly, president of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Life Insurance Company, and Professor W. A. Thompson of the University of 
                        South Dakota
                    , a native of Gibson Township, spoke in 1931 and 1932, respectively. The secretary of
                    the Indiana Farm Bureau, Larry Brandon, gave the address in 1940. In 1951 the commanding officer of
                    Fort Knox was invited to speak, and the Fort Knox Band was asked to play.18
                    There must have been last-minute complications, for it was the Reverend T. Maxey, minister at Bunker
                    Hill, who actually spoke and a band from Scottsburg that actually played.19
            
            Many a campaign trail wound through Mayfield's Grove. A secretary of state, Ed 
                        Jackson
                    , spoke in 1923; a dean of the Law School at Indiana University, Paul V. McNutt, in
                    1928; and a lieutenant-governor, Clifford M. Townsend, in 1935. Each was to serve Indiana as
                    governor, as would Ralph F. Gates who spoke in 1944. Lieutenant-governor Henry F. Schricker spoke in
                    1939 and again in 1948 during a successful campaign for the governorship. In 1917, shortly after his
                    term of office had expired, Governor Samuel M. Ralston came, and in 1934 the unsuccessful Republican
                    candidate for governor in 1932, Judge Raymond S. Springer, attended. In 1929 Congressman James W.
                    Dunbar stood before the picnickers. His successor, Congressman Eugene B. Crowe, delivered an address
                    in 1931 and another in 1936 during a run for reelection. Frederick Van Nuys and Birch E. Bayh spoke
                    in Little York in 1932 and 1962, the years in which they were elected to the Senate. A third, but
                    unsuccessful, senatorial aspirant and former assistant attorney general, Alexander M. Campbell,
                    spoke in 1950. It was 
                        Campbell
                     who supervised the prosecutions of Axis Sally and 
                        Tokyo
                     Rose as well as that of Harry Bridges and handled the indictment of Alger Hiss.20
            
            References to the speeches themselves are few. In 1925 W. H. Book spoke on "The Heart of
                    Christianity." In 1943, when "gas and tire rationing kept hundreds of regular
                    attendants from coming,"21 the commanding officer of Camp Atterbury,
                    near 
                        Columbus
                    , spoke, and appropriately enough the Camp Atterbury Band played. The commanding
                    officer, Colonel Welton M. Modisette, "made an excellent address which was informative, and
                    interesting to those who knew little of army life or training such

                    Nazi atrocities, and in 1962 Bayh dealt with the "common problems of government and the
                        people."23
            
            When the last speaker finished, stringed instruments were brought out, and although many people were
                    already homeward bound, there would usually be a respectable audience as long as there was any
                    music. In 1934 the Trueblood Boys, then playing over station WOWO in 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , performed old-time music. The group, a local one that played in Mayfield's
                    Grove more than once, consisted of a fiddle, a banjo, a guitar, and a tenor guitar.24 Will J. Nicholson (1886–1953), the leader of the visiting wind band of 1919,
                    often came from 
                        Salem
                     with a similar string band.25 In 1928 the 
                        Salem
                    
                    Democrat announced: "Will J. Nicholson, popular musician of 
                        Salem
                     is also on the program for some special numbers." The newspaper added:
                    "Will is an expert player on the banjo and his services are in great demand."26 Nicholson played in 1943 and undoubtedly in other years as well. He and many
                    other musicians played the waltzes, the breakdowns, and the other country and western pieces of
                    their day.27
            
            On the first Saturday in August the superintendent of Little York Christian Church became a master of
                    ceremonies. He recognized each Sunday school as it arrived and introduced the judges and the band of
                    the day. He notified the picnickers that a small child had been lost and that another had been
                    found. He announced each special number by title and identified the school bringing it. He read the
                    list of prizewinners and distributed the purses. He introduced the speakers or the dignitary chosen
                    to perform that task. In 1962, for example, he introduced William E. Wilson, the state
                    superintendent of public instruction and a native of the area, who in turn introduced the speaker,
                    Birch E. Bayh.
            Unfortunately, no one counted noses on the first Saturday of August. In 1910 the population of Gibson
                    Township was 1,290, and in 1914 attendance at the picnic was conservatively placed at three
                    thousand, in 1915 at two thousand. According to the

                     —estimated that between five and seven thousand
                    people attended the picnic of 1917.28 In 1930, 875 people lived in the township,
                    and in 1934 it was thought that more than three thousand came to Mayfield's Grove. In 1940
                    the population was 1,033, and in 1943 the attendance was set at over a thousand. Finally, in 1960
                    the population was 1,001,29 and in 1962 attendance was put at seven hundred.
            Other congregations also held Sunday school picnics. At one time or another the Zoah Christians, the
                    Bethany Baptists, the Bunker Hill Christians, and the Livonia Baptists sponsored similar
                    festivities, and there were picnics in Warriner's Grove at Delaney.30
                    All of these celebrations were apparently cast from the same mold. There were always speakers, a
                    band, and prizes for the special numbers; and, in the earlier years, there were recitations, grand
                    marches, and fiddle music, too. A brief notice of a Sunday school picnic at Clear Creek in 
                        Monroe County
                     on June 13, 1871, suggests that the mold may have been an old one. There was a dinner
                    and instrumental as well as vocal music, and the attendance was estimated to be between 1,000 and
                    2,000. This picnic, too, was sponsored by the Christians.31 The Little York
                    Christians attended various of these other picnics. From 1892 to 1952 the Russell Chapel Methodists,
                    the Tampico Christians, and the Tampico Baptists in 
                        Jackson County
                     cosponsored a picnic on the second Saturday in August.32 In 1913
                    "the Little York Christian Sunday School went to the picnic at Tampico and carried off the
                    first prize for the best singing and also the prize for the best declamation."33
            
            At a meeting on July 3, 1965, the Little York Christian Church came to an all but inevitable decision
                    concerning its own picnic and homecoming: the annual event became a thing of the past. The following
                    week a sympathetic editorial with many fine words for the people of Little York appeared in the

                    now in use as a church. On the other hand, the church at Mt. Hebron, now a Christian church, is

                    The Special Numbers
                
            Throughout the years the 
                        Washington County
                     newspapers reported a few names of the musical prizewinners at the Little York Sunday
                    School Picnic and Homecoming,35 but the titles of the songs that they sang were
                    not mentioned. In fact, there seem to be no records of any sort—neither handwritten lists
                    nor annotated songbooks—for the special numbers that were presented on that first
                    Saturday in August. There are, however, the recollections of the singers, accompanists, and musical
                    directors at the picnic. When asked to help compile a list of songs that were brought to the
                    festivities, these veteran picnickers 16inforced their memories with whatever songbooks that they
                    had at hand. The books that were used at the picnic itself proved invaluable in putting the list
                    together, but other, fairly recent compilations of later tastes and outlooks contained little beyond
                    perennial favorites. Identification was, on the whole, fairly positive, although none of the
                    participants were willing to assign the date of a particular picnic to any special number.
            Little York Christian
            The pianist who played for some filly years at the Little York Christian Church identified eleven
                    special numbers from a book that she had on her piano.36 She recalled four
                    others. Using another book,37 two lifelong members of this Sunday school came
                    across eight titles and recalled an additional three. Three in this second group of eleven titles
                    had already been mentioned by the pianist. It is, then, a list of twenty-three titles.
            
               
                  35 In 1910 the first prize for singing went to West Point, and in 1919 it
                        went to Mt. Hebron. In 1938 Tampico Baptist tied with Mt. Eden and in 1946 with 
                            Mt. Carmel
                         for first prize in quartet singing and took, in both years, the prize for duets.

            Mt. Eden Christian
            The Sunday school at Mt. Eden, one of the mainstays of the Little York picnic, was a fairly large
                    one. In 1938 Mt. Eden took the prize for the largest delegation, and the school's records
                    show that on the following day the attendance was sixty-six. The banner carried on the first
                    Saturday in August is still treasured and now hangs on the front wall of the sanctuary. One pianist
                    contributed eighteen of the twenty-one titles that are listed below. A previous pianist, a woman
                    whose mother was one of the directors at this Sunday school, recalled "I Would Not Be
                    Denied."

                            the surnames of the author and the composer. A date enclosed in parentheses is the earliest
                            date established. Where author and composer are the one and the same person, the most
                            complete name found in the printed source is given. Pseudonyms have been retained.

                        Mt. Carmel
                     was a small one. During the 1930s the average attendance cannot have been much over
                    twenty. Three married couples and as many of their twelve children as were living at home drove. If
                    the weather were not inclement,

                     two women came on foot, one with her three children. Although
                    the school met every Sunday, church services were, at times, held biweekly. From about 1936 the
                    singing at both Sunday school and church was from Praise and Service Songs.40 Three people contributed titles for the 
                        Mt. Carmel
                     list. One, a lifelong member of this church, sang in its adult choir for many years. He
                    remembered practicing various songs and added that the specials for the picnic were the only songs
                    that the Sunday school learned. His father was the bass and his mother the soprano of its quartet
                    during the 1930s and the 1940s. The other two persons who supplied songs for this list grew up in
                    the Mt. Eden congregation and did not begin attending 
                        Mt. Carmel
                     until the 1940s. One, the pianist who contributed eighteen titles to the Mt. Eden list,
                    saw service as an accompanist at both churches. Although these three informants were unable to
                    recall the year in which any one special was sung, it may be surmised that few, if any, were sung
                    prior to 1935.

            Tampico Baptist
            This Sunday school, another mainstay of the picnic at Little York, was also a fairly large one.
                    Records show that on August 7, 1938, the attendance was sixty, slightly smaller than that at Mt.
                    Eden on the same day. Elmer Robbins, the conductor, listed the special numbers for Tampico Baptist.
                    Much of this music is to be found in songbooks printed in the South. It is in shaped notes and
                    belongs to the contemporary shaped-note gospel or "new book" music tradition.42 Given the homogeneity of the previous lists, its appearance here is striking
                    and warrants a canvass of the rural Baptist churches in southern Indiana.

            The Sunday schools that provided the above lists were nothing if not eclectic. Twenty-eight of the
                    special numbers date from the closing decades of the nineteenth century, and this fairly old music
                    would seem to have been a Little York specialty. Fifteen pieces of fairly new music, the music of
                    the 1920s and the 1930s, were sung by the schools at 
                        Mt. Carmel
                     and Tampico. Each of the two other schools lists but one number from the 1920s and none
                    from the 1930s. Thirty-six numbers date from the two opening decades of the twentieth century. Some
                    fifty of the eighty-one special numbers first appeared during the picnic years.
            There are, somewhat surprisingly, no fewer than fifty-six composers for the eighty-one titles. No one
                    name emerges as a favorite. There are three compositions by William Kirkpatrick and three by Lelia
                    Morris. Three of Charles Gabriel's six compositions were brought by the junior choir at Mt.
                    Eden, but inasmuch as the other schools failed to list children's numbers, it may be well
                    to set these aside, crediting Gabriel, too, with three numbers. Little York brought two of James
                    McGranahan's compositions and two of Winfield Weeden's; the Sunday school at Mt.
                    Eden brought two of Samuel Beazley's and two of William Hac-kleman's; and that at
                    Tampico brought two of Barney 
                        Warren
                    's and two of Virgil Stamps's. There are, in addition, two
                    compositions by William Ogden, the one composer the school at Tampico had in common with the other
                    schools. The showing of Haldor Lillena, seven special numbers, is, then, impressive. Beginning in
                    1923 he was active in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and set up there the publishing house sold in 1930 to the Nazarene Publishing House of 
                        Kansas City
                    .45 His showing here may not be altogether fortuitous.
            The dotted eighth note and the sixteenth, taken as a pair, are more or less conspicuous in
                    twenty-five of the forty-three numbers in common time. Very little else is in a simple meter, there
                    being but three numbers in 3/4 meter and two in 2/4. 
                  
                     44 This is the only spiritual sung at the picnic. It is said to have

                     The compound meters are another matter. Seventeen specials are
                    in 6/8 meter, ten in 6/4, two in 9/8, one in 9/4, and three are in 12/8—a total of
                    thirty-three. The dotted eighth and sixteenth pattern can be found in three of the numbers in 6/8
                    and in the stanza of "Redeemed," a number in 12/8. The companion pattern, the
                    dotted quarter and eighth, can be found in but one number in 6/4, "Where We'll
                    Never Grow Old." There are, perhaps, fewer instances of the dotted eighth and sixteenth
                    pattern and more numbers in compound meters than might have been supposed.
            The schools do not seem to have preferred one style of writing to another. There are, on the one
                    hand, specials in which the unrelieved chordal style prevalent in the stanza of the gospel song is
                    used for the chorus (e.g., "It's Just Like His Great Love"). There are,
                    on the other hand, specials in which stanza and chorus are differentiated texturally, specials in
                    which the independent writing in the chorus is clearly of major importance ("When Love
                    Shines In"). Tunes are not invariably in the uppermost part. In the chorus of one of the
                    quartets, "We're On Our Way," the first half of the tune is given to the
                    alto, and the second half is divided between the tenor and the soprano. The melodic line throughout
                    this quartet is a succession of short phrases, each having but one sustained note, and beyond
                    providing this one note with harmony and, at the same time, maintaining the characteristic rhythm,
                    the remaining voices have very little to do. The style is common enough and can be found in more
                    than one special brought from Tampico. Two numbers brought from Mt. Eden and one brought from Little
                    York also employ this style, but it fails to appear in any number brought from 
                        Mt. Carmel
                    . Although intricacies of one sort or another were evidently to their liking, these
                    confirmed part-singers were not unaware of the effectiveness of unison singing. From time to time
                    there are passages of it, but "Christ Is King" is the only thoroughgoing unison
                    number listed. Most writing, however, is basically syllabic.
            A dozen or so "choir songs," somewhat ambitious compositions running to as much as
                    two full pages appear on the list.46 Ordinarily the stanza of the choir song
                    utilizes the straightforward chordal style, and in one, "Master, the Tempest Is
                    Raging," it is used for chorus as well. In three of the pieces sung by the Mt. Eden
                    children, the martial touch of the oompah bass line is 
                  
                     46 In the songbooks compositions of this sort can be found grouped
                            together and headed "Special Selections," "Chorus
                            Collections," or "Two-Page Songs and Anthems."
               
                     found in the accompaniment. In the chorus of
                    "Harvest-Time Is Here" and in that of "Reapers for the Harvest,"
                    two choir songs of the same school, the line is, however, sung. There is extensive writing for
                    women's voices with accompaniment in the chorus of "God's Love Will Never
                    Grow Old" and in that of "The Captain Is Calling," two of 
                        Mt. Carmel
                    's choir songs. In the former the melody is in the alto part. L. B.
                    Leister's "Wake the Song," a "jubilee anthem" sung by
                    the Tampico Sunday School, could well be the only through-composed special sung at the picnic.
            The melodic line in the stanza of "Our Commander," a Mt. Eden choir song, is for
                    male voices in unison, and the writing in the chorus includes a variety of other, contrasting
                    textures. The piece appears in Wonderful Jesus and Other Songs,47 and in 1945 Mt. Eden's pianist bought two copies of the book at Gypsy
                    Smith's revival in 
                        Louisville
                     (May 13–27), later ordering additional copies for the use of the singers.48 The Sunday school, then, brought "Our Commander" to
                    Mayfield's Grove in 1945 or, possibly, in the following year. This is a special number to
                    date with confidence. The pianist was playing accompaniments in the late 1930s, and it is unlikely
                    that any of the other seventeen titles she contributed were sung much before that time. "I
                    Would Not Be Denied" and "What If It Were To-day?" were contributed by
                    her predecessor and were undoubtedly sung somewhat earlier, although perhaps later than
                    "Still Sweeter Every Day."
            "In 1912 the Tampico Sunday School won the first prize for singing Just Over in
                        the Glory-Land at the Little York Picnic. The same year at the Bethany Picnic, they won
                    first prize for singing Marching On. Another prize-winner was Wear a
                        Crown."
               49 At that time "Just Over in the
                    Glory-Land" and "Marching On" were still very new songs: the former was
                    copyrighted in 1906, the latter in 1905. "Marching On" can be found in Majestic Praises, and the endpapers of Elmer Robbins's copy show that the
                    book was in use at the Tampico Sunday School as early as 1912, the year in which the book was
                    published. Three other songs in the same collection, "Wear a Crown,"
                    "We're On Our Way," and "Wake the Song," may also have
                    been sung at a fairly early date. The Tampico Baptists frequently sang J. H. Alleman's
                    "Are You Ready?" as an encore. It can be found in the revised edition of White Wings, which came out around the turn of the century.

            The publication dates of the books in Robbins's possession suggest that much of the
                    remaining music was sung in later times. Five numbers can be found in the enlarged edition ofFavorite Radio Songs (1937), and three of the male quartet numbers appear in Gospel Quartets (1938). Favorite Radio Songs, No. 2 (1939)
                    contains "My Far-Away Home," a number which the Tampico Baptists sang as a
                    quartet, and Favorite Songs and Hymns (1939) contains four adult numbers of a
                    single page each, two mixed quartet songs, and the only duet of this school. Although these dates
                    are by no means conclusive (the fourth of these books contains "Just Over in the
                    Glory-Land," the prize-winning number of 1912), it would seem fairly certain that much of
                    this music was also sung in later years, at some time after 1935.
            In his autobiography Haldor Lillenas noted with satisfaction that his "Wonderful Grace of
                    Jesus" had been put to a use that he had not envisaged. "This number, designed to
                    be a choir song, has been taken over by the general public and has had a phenomenal circulation. It
                    is to be deplored that most people sing it too fast."50 The Little York
                    Christians used it as a special number, and it is, of course, the mounted marshal, the delegations
                    and their banners, the groups of instrumentalists, the politician with an eye on the
                    governor's mansion, and the great mass of people enjoying a holiday that distinguish this
                    use and enrich the history of the gospel song.

            It may be well to add that none of this article was written dispassionately. 
                        Mt. Carmel
                     stood within sight of my grandparents' house, and the copies of Praise and Service Songs in use at the church were a gift of my grandmother and my mother.
                    My mother was said to have a nice "touch" on the piano, and she accompanied the
                    Sunday school's numbers, coming at one time from 
                        Columbus
                     by interurban and later from 
                        Bloomington
                     by train. The tenor of the quartet, my grandfather's second cousin, was the
                    husband of the director and an uncle to both the wife of the director at Tampico Baptist and the
                    woman from Mt. Eden who contributed "I Would Not Be Denied." The bass of the 
                        Mt. Carmel

                    for myself, I can remember very little beyond the rehearsals for "I Will Arise and
                    Go" and the endless and often heated discussions about the nature of compound time.
         
         
         
            History, Politics, and the Active Life: Jacob Piatt Dunn, Progressive Historian
            
                    Lana Ruegamer
                    ∗
                
            Jacob Piatt Dunn, Jr., (1855–1924) did not cut a large swath in the history of American
                    historiography. Those who recognize his name at all do so either because of his work in Indian
                    history (especially the classic Massacres of the Mountains, published in 1886) or
                    because of his multivolumed contributions to Indiana history during his long service for the Indiana
                    Historical Society. His name is not one that rings among those of the great historians of the
                    nineteenth century who have sometimes been described as "romantic," nor is he
                    recognized as a colleague of Frederick 
                        Jackson
                     Turner and Charles A. Beard, arguing the importance of sectional and economic interests
                    in the interpretation of the early national period. He belongs neither to the tradition of the
                    wealthy amateur belles lettrists nor to that of the first generation of Ph.D.s in history. If he
                    fits any model, it is rather that of the historian cum politician, including such exemplars as

                    Claude G. Bowers. Dunn, of course, was far less prominent politically and—except for
                    Wilson, who was a professional historian—more prolific a writer than these other
                    political men of letters. His example suggests a model for the middle rank of historians who were
                    considerably more numerous than the wealthy amateurs, the new Ph.D.s, or the famous politicians and
                    whose obscurity on the national scene does not refute their local fame and usefulness. And the

            Dunn was born in 1855 in 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , one of Indiana's pioneer towns on the Ohio River and
                    just across the border from 
                        Ohio
                    . His grandparents had helped to settle the Miami River valley; his parents moved to 
                        Indianapolis
                     during the Civil War. They were a middling sort of people, prosperous enough to send
                    their son to college at the 
                        Quaker
                     school, Earlham, where he was graduated in 1874 at age nineteen. He took a law degree a
                    few years later at the University of Michigan and found himself at the age of twenty-one ready to
                    meet the world.1
            
            Dunn was a handsome, genial youth with a clear head and a facile pen. He practiced law for a few
                    years after college, but his interests ranged much wider than the law. He was especially attracted
                    to history and natural history. Like many young men of his generation, raised on tales of pioneer
                    courage and the military heroes of the Civil War, he also had a taste for adventure. His father sent
                    him and two brothers to Colorado in 1879 to look after some investments in silver mines,2 and Dunn stayed for five years, prospecting for silver and at the same time
                    exploring Indian lore and Indian history with a passionate devotion to detail. He also worked for
                    several Leadville and 
                        Denver
                     newspapers and in covering the political scene became acquainted with the perils of
                    corrupt city governments, which apparently inspired a lifelong interest in political reform.3
            
            He was also inspired by the publication in 1881 of Helen Hunt 
                        Jackson
                    's A Century of Dishonor, an emotional expose of the
                    injustices inflicted upon American Indians. It may have been 
                        Jackson
                    's book that prompted Dunn to consider writing a thoroughly researched history
                    of relations between whites and Indians in the Far West as a scholarly buttress to 
                        Jackson
                    's plea for justice.4 In any event, Dunn undertook
                    extensive research in the history of the Indians in the Far West. He was among the first

            In 1884 Dunn returned to the practice of law and to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where he researched his book in the Indiana State Library, an official repository for
                    federal publications. The resulting manuscript was published in 1886 under the sensational (and
                    somewhat misleading) title Massacres of the Mountains. While the title suggests a
                    cheap potboiler, what Dunn produced was an 
                  
                     5 John A. Hawgood, "Historical Forward," in ibid. (reprint, 
                                London
                            , 1965), 1.
               
                     evenhanded, even sober-minded recital of a depressing series of
                    events, with a thoughtful analysis of policies and personalities along the way. Not that Massacres was in any way dull; those who bought the book for the gory thrills of
                    brutal Indian wars were probably satisifed that they got their money's worth. But along
                    with the inescapable gore they received a large-minded view of the tragedy of the western Indians
                    and a detailed analysis of the events and policies that led to the tragedy. The book turned out to
                    be a classic, and it is still used and respected by scholars a century later.
            Dunn did not distance himself from the events and policies he described; his was no Olympian view. He
                    was capable of outrage and even outraged eloquence on the subject of injustice and stupidity. On the
                    removal of the peaceable White Mountain Indians in 1875 from their homes on the orders of the Bureau
                    of Indian Affairs, Dunn wrote:
                        Search you now the history of the whole world and find a more wanton act of tyranny than the
                            removal of these Indians from their homes. They would have saluted a Gesler's hat
                            without a murmur; they would have paid a tax on tea without much remonstrance; a foreign
                            lord might have lived in their 
                                Dublin
                             Castle without making them desperate. It is almost questionable whether Nero
                            would have been capable of treating his friends and allies as the humane gentlemen treated
                            these unfortunate bands, and yet men ask why the Apaches cannot be made peaceable.
                     Dunn concluded: "There are some Indians into whose necks it will not do to grind
                    your heels too far."6 But the effectiveness of these outbursts comes
                    from their relative rarity. In general, Dunn, while he set about parceling out blame and credit in
                    his narrative, found few villains and few heroes—just victims of generations of bad
                    policies on all sides.
            While Dunn was clearly no tract writer in Massacres, he was concerned to affect
                    policy. He made extensively argued cases against the Indian Bureau policy of concentrating more and
                    more Indians onto smaller and smaller reservations and against the unchecked power of Indian agents.
                    His narrative is filled with "lessons" to be learned from the errors of the
                    past—some of which grate harshly on late twentieth century ears, as for example his
                    advice that firmness is more important than kindness in dealing with Indians; his conclusion that it
                    was essential to break the spirit of the Indians in order to "civilize" them; and
                    his unquestioned goal of "Americanizing" Indians so that "the Indian will
                    almost be lost in the American."7

            What makes Massacres of the Mountains a classic is its richly detailed narrative
                    firmly based in documentary evidence and Dunn's clearheaded analysis of who did what to
                    whom in hundreds of clashes between Indians and their white competitors for land and power in the
                    Far West. While the book had neither great heroes and exalted narrative on the one hand nor a strong
                    progressive thesis on the other hand, it was soundly researched and thoroughly readable history.
            
               Massacres of the Mountains did very well for its thirty-one-year-old author. On the
                    basis of it Houghton Mifflin invited Dunn to prepare the volume on Indiana in the publishing
                    firm's prestigious American Commonwealths series; thus he joined such
                    illustrious contemporaries as Reuben Gold Thwaites and Josiah Royce in the series list.
            In the course of his researches both for Massacres and the Indiana volume Dunn
                    found himself drawn willy-nilly into his home state's small historical society movement.
                    When he first began to try to use the state library, he discovered the deplorable condition of
                    historical materials in Indiana. In 1885 the library was temporarily housed in a few rooms downtown
                    awaiting the construction of the new state capitol. There was no order to the federal publications
                    Dunn used so extensively and no card catalog. A large number of the books, which supposedly numbered
                    23,000 volumes, were falling apart, and a significant percentage was composed of duplicates. The
                    large pamphlet collection was nearly unusable because the pamphlets were unbound and uncataloged.
                    The Indiana materials were especially pathetic; there was no complete set of state and territorial
                    laws and only a fragmentary collection of other state publications. No state archives existed except
                    the files of the secretary of state, which were inaccessible and incomplete.8
            
            It was probably fortunate that Dunn was not the only person who found the situation burdensome.
                    Several other local historians joined forces with Dunn to try to remedy the problems. One of them
                    was a major figure in the state Democratic party (the Democratic nominee for vice-president in 1880,
                    William H. English), another a Republican judge, Daniel Wait Howe. Their first strategy was to
                    revive the moribund Indiana Historical Society, which had been organized in 1830 but had never
                    managed to hold regular meetings for any length of time despite numerous attempts at reorganization
                    and revival. Dunn was elected recording secretary in 1886 and was to be a major figure in the 
                  
                     8 Ruegamer, A History of the Indiana Historical
                            Society, 80.
               
                     society's relative success in the ensuing thirty-eight
                    years. Under Dunn's leadership the society was to be a major force in transforming the
                    state library by the turn of the century with increased appropriations and, eventually, a librarian
                    removed from politics. Dunn accomplished the remarkable feat of prying these funds from a
                    notoriously non-book-minded legislature, he recalled, by a strenuous lobbying effort. He acquired
                    the support of the Knights of Labor and a wide variety of agricultural organizations, such as
                    "the State Board of Agriculture, Horticultural Society, Horse Breeders, Sheep Breeders,
                    Short Horn Breeders, Hog Breeders, Bee Keepers, etc. ... on condition that the literature of their
                    various lines be put in the library. ..."9
            
            In 1888, the same year that the legislature increased its aid to the library, Dunn's Indiana: A Redemption from Slavery appeared. The study was based on published
                    documents and early histories—some of which at least he no doubt found in the state
                    library—with some use of archival materials in 
                        Canada
                     and in Congress. Only a few Indiana manuscripts are cited. Dunn's
                    acknowledgments suggest heavy reliance on librarians and copyists in Quebec, 
                  Toronto, Boston
               ,
                    and 
                        Washington
                    , though he himself may have traveled to some of the libraries mentioned. Like Massacres, Dunn's Indiana was well researched and
                    even-handed, though readers may have been disappointed that at the end of the 450-page book Dunn had
                    brought them no further than statehood in 1816, seventy years before. (In the 1905 revision Dunn
                    tacked on a fifty-page summary of the succeeding ninety years of Indiana history, though he used
                    only six pages to summarize the forty years since the Civil War.)
            Dunn's thesis was that Indiana politics since the Ordinance of 1787 had been shaped by the
                    slavery issue and that, despite a complex heritage that inclined the territory to be
                    "soft" on slavery (including a proslavery territorial governor, William Henry
                    Harrison), "the men of Indiana," as he put it, emancipated the state by outlawing
                    slavery in the first state constitution.10 Dunn's book is heavy going
                    in the parts where he traces the legal history of slavery in the Northwest Territory, and whenever
                    he is trying to establish disputed dates, the text reads like a long, knotty footnote; but much of
                    his work is unforgettable. His descriptions of the coureurs de bois, French
                    settlers, and George Rogers Clark's famous expedition to 
                        Vincennes

                     wrought with enthusiasm and care, and the author's
                    respect for and delight in his material are obvious. Dunn contributes surefooted leadership through
                    complex political disputes of the territory, analyzing the work of obscure committees and
                    petitioners to explicate the variety of interests that motivated pioneer politics. But most
                    impressive is his chapter-long description of how personal politics operated in the territory,
                    showing the face-to-face style of the very successful Jonathan Jennings, who was elected
                    Indiana's first delegate to Congress in 1809 against the opposition of Harrison.
                    Jennings's success, Dunn argues, had little to do with issues—though he was
                    clearly antislavery—and everything to do with Jennings's attractions as a
                    person. At strategic points in his campaign the twenty-five-year-old candidate pitched in and helped
                    with logrolling and mowing, and he demonstrated his antiaristocratic style whenever possible.11
            
            After the publication of two successful books in two years, one might have expected Dunn to make his
                    living henceforward as a state historian, as his contemporary Reuben Gold Thwaites was to do in

                    . There were two obstacles to this outcome, however: the first was the absence of a
                    viable historical society with sufficient funds to support a director, and the second was
                    Dunn's own incorrigible multiplicity of interests. Of these the more serious was probably
                    the absence of an institution to offer him a job. In 
                        Madison
                    , Thwaites had worked as a newspaper editor for ten years before being handpicked by
                    Lyman C. Draper as his successor at the State Historical Society of Wisconsin in 1887. Thwaites
                    inherited both Draper's livelihood and lifelong access to the splendid library of rare
                    books and manuscripts that Draper had collected. Since the Wisconsin historical society was located
                    in the same city as the state university, Thwaites was also able to encourage closer relationships
                    between the institutions and to profit from access to professionally trained colleagues, including
                    Frederick 
                        Jackson
                     Turner. By contrast, in Indiana there was no great historical society, no great
                    library, and the state university was located fifty miles away in 
                        Bloomington
                    —and had no one like Turner in any event.
            The closest thing to a position like Thwaites's in Indiana was that of the state librarian,
                    a political job elected by the state legislature, and this Dunn was given for two terms,
                    1889–1892. Dunn accomplished a great deal for the library in his two terms with the funds
                    he succeeded in prying loose from the General Assembly. He filled in broken sets of books, had
                    damaged volumes 
                  
                     11

                     rebound, worked diligently at the task of cataloging, and
                    purchased historical books along with those on various kinds of animal husbandry that he had
                    promised in return for support. Unfortunately, the relatively generous monetary support awarded to
                    the library by the legislature during Dunn's terms turned out to be a brief interruption in
                    an otherwise unbroken pattern of penuriousness. The General Assembly halved the state
                    library's appropriation for 1893–1894, and it must have been clear to the
                    enterprising young Dunn that there was no career in the state library.12
            
            The career that Dunn settled upon was that of a political man of letters—a political
                    journalist with frequent forays into political office, both elective and appointive. Though Dunn is
                    remembered for his historical publications and his faithful service to the Indiana Historical
                    Society, he made his living as a professional Democrat.
            Dunn began writing occasional editorials for the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Sentinel, the local Democratic organ, soon after his return from 
                        Colorado
                    . He was on the staff of the Republican 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal for a year before his election as state librarian (while he was lobbying
                    for increased appropriations for the library) and returned to the staff of the Sentinel after his terms were up. Even while he was serving in various offices, Dunn continued
                    to write for newspapers.13 Journalism was his primary source of income for most
                    of his adult life, and most of what he wrote was partisan political analysis. In a day when both
                    politics and newspapers played a larger role in most people's daily lives than they do
                    now—politics surely was the major sport for most American men until
                    World War I—"Jape" Dunn was a master of the shrewd and entertaining
                    political editorial. Consider this typical example on paternalism—which he
                    opposed—from 1894 (one of the few periods when Dunn was in charge of editorials for the
                        Sentinel and when, consequently, it is reasonably certain that any given
                    editorial was written by him):

                            aid, from the grants of government aid that have been actually made during the past thirty
                            years? . . . Suppose the inmates of the penitentiary

                                Michigan City
                             should ask the government to give them a bounty of $20,000,000 a
                            year, as the McKinley law gives to the sugar trust? Why not do it? They are just as
                            law-abiding and just as useful people to the country as the controllers of the sugar trust.
                            Indeed they are not nearly so demoralizing to public morals.14
                  
                     His remarks about the powerful Republican Senator John Sherman struck a similar note.
                        
                        The most discouraging thing connected with the rapid movement toward universal bimetallism is
                            the fact that John Sherman announces that he favors it. This is prima facie evidence that
                            there must be some awful financial fallacy involved in the matter, for John Sherman never
                            voluntarily got on the right side of any currency question in his life.15
                  
                     While his drollery was nearly always contentious and partisan, its style and tone place it
                    firmly in the tradition of political humorists like Finley Peter Dunne and Will Rogers. Droll,
                    combative, and sarcastic, Dunn needled his opponents and wheedled his fellow Democrats with great
                    skill.
            Dunn was, of course, a reformer, though he often spoke scornfully of reformers. He loathed anyone who
                    seemed to be holier-than-thou; somehow reform was all right as long as the people making the rules
                    did not pretend to be better than those who were breaking them. As Dunn saw it, reform was a matter
                    of self-interest. Defending himself against fellow Democrats who objected to his attacks on
                    Democratic malefactors, he wrote: "There is nothing to be gained by attempting to whitewash
                    guilty or incompetent officials. The people are not fools. The democratic party in Indiana never
                    prospered as it has since it inaugurated the policy of punishing its own rascals."16
            
            By 1888 Dunn was assigned to the literary bureau of the Democratic State Central Committee and flung
                    himself into the tariff question with a ninety-five-page tract entitled Seven Percent
                        Off: What the Democratic Party Demands from the Protection Monopolists. He was an important
                    factor in the successful campaign for the Australian ballot in 1889, making Indiana one of the
                    earliest states in the nation to adopt this method of voting,

                     charter in 1891—both measures that had tremendous impact on the political
                    history of the state. He was a strong influence in the major tax reform enacted in 1891 and was a
                    member of the state tax commission that recommended revisions in the law in 1917. While Dunn
                    occasionally published articles and pamphlets on national issues like the re-monetization of silver
                    and the tariff, most of his work dealt with local issues—either municipal problems like
                    paving the roads and building local libraries or state issues like taxation and revision of the
                    state constitution.17
            
            Dunn became an expert on improving libraries during his tenure as state librarian and was appointed
                    to the state public library commission at its inception in 1899. He served as its president until
                    1914 and was a member until 1919, diligently advising township officials how to claim their Carnegie
                    library money and how to improve local libraries.18
            
            Dunn was the Democratic candidate for Congress in his district in 1902, during the long period of
                    Republican domination in state politics from 1894 to 1908. He lost, of course, but he was appointed
                    city controller in 1903 and ultimately served two terms in the Office.19
            
            While Dunn was making his living as a politician and political writer, he continued to research and
                    write history. Some of these projects were very large, so that one is continually amazed at his
                    productivity. This part-time historian produced five monographs for the Indiana Historical Society
                    and edited its first seven volumes of publications (each volume including numerous monographs). He
                    contributed scholarly articles to professional historical and political science journals.20 He wrote for extensive biographical publications like Men of
                        Progress: Indiana (1899) and Memorial and Genealogical Record of
                        Representative Citizens of Indiana (1912).

            Dunn's monumental Greater

                appeared in 1910; and, while the biographies that comprise volume II are in
                    the standard laudatory style of the period, the large first volume is intelligently written,
                    well-researched, vivid local history. Anyone who has ever been obliged to plow through the standard
                    city histories will be impressed by the contrast Dunn's work provides. He is that rarest of
                    local historians: one who never "boosts" and never apologizes. And yet this
                    resolute candor is not purchased at the expense of a social scientist's indifference. Dunn
                    loved 
                        Indianapolis
                    ; it was just that he loved the town, warts and all. His opening remarks in the chapter
                    on early schools are typical: "One who reads the early school legislation of Indiana is
                    liable to get an exaggerated idea of the extent of the public schools. The provision for them was
                    very full, on paper, but it  did not amount to a great deal in
                        money."21 As he debunked these "paper" schools,
                    Dunn also systematically deprecated the conditions historians often use to romanticize the pioneer
                    period. In 
                        Indianapolis
                    , according to Dunn, the Indians caused no trouble at all; the ague was no worse there
                    than anywhere else; if the town was less lawless and more religious than average it was only because
                    "it was not on any line of travel"; and, except for the first two years,
                    "there was never any approach to general privation and hardship in 
                        Indianapolis
                     . . . ." His chapter on railroad development is muckraking history, arguing
                    that the railroads and corrupt courts and state representatives defrauded the state. His is no dull
                    paean; it is critical history at its liveliest—and with footnotes, no less!22

                is also a rather personal history, since in 1910 Dunn had been a resident of
                    the city for more than half of its ninety-year existence, and a significant part of his story about
                    city government after 1885 concerns events in which he played a conspicuous part. Dunn generally
                    acknowledges his role in these controversies and seems fair in giving his opponents their due.23 Dunn had an astute grasp of how institutions worked and an unparalleled
                    knowledge of the local newspapers, so it is easy to imagine the work's virtues.

                        and Indianans in five volumes, three of which are biographical. In contrast with his
                    sharply focused Indiana: A Redemption from Slavery of thirty years before, in Indiana and Indianans Dunn addressed the whole range of Indiana history. The
                    volume afforded Dunn an opportunity to incorporate recent scholarship on many of the events treated
                    in the earlier history; it also provided him with a platform from which to defend himself against
                    the criticisms of Theodore Roosevelt, who had attacked Dunn a few years earlier in The
                        Winning of the West for describing George Rogers Clark as "the Hannibal of the
                    West." Roosevelt had written contemptuously of "the small western historians who
                    have really damaged . . . [Clark's] reputation by the absurd inflation of their
                    language." Dunn forcefully defended the appellation (which, he pointed out, was first used
                    not by "a small western historian" but by John 
                        Randolph
                     of Roanoake), wittily casting aspersions upon Roosevelt's command of Latin.

               , its virtues are great and very like those of the earlier volume. Both works
                    are indispensable sources for workers in Indiana history.24
            
            In all these years of pursuing politics and local history, Dunn never lost track of his earliest
                    interest, American Indians. He had demonstrated an interest in Indian languages even in Massacres of the Mountains, where he frequently translated Indian names and terms and
                    called special attention to the fact that the Pueblos had apparently lost the art of writing their
                    language, since a book of hieroglyphs that no one was able to read was reported to have been kept by
                    them as a sacred relic.25
            
            Dunn made some inquiries about the Miami language in preparing the Indiana volume
                    for the American Commonwealths series between 1886 and 1888, and in 1888 he
                    corresponded briefly with fellow Hoosier James Mooney of the Bureau of Ethnology on the value of
                    studying Indian customs and languages.26 (It is tempting to speculate that Dunn,
                    who was still a young man looking for his place in the world, may have been trying to drum up a
                    position with the bureau). But it was not until 1905 that Dunn began regular study of the Miami
                    language. Perhaps he simply needed respite from the pressures of office—he was 
                        Indianapolis city
                     controller at the time. Dunn had revised his Indiana volume for the
                        American Commonwealths series the previous year, and this may have turned his
                    attention again to the rapid disappearance of all evidence that Indians had once occupied Indiana.
                    Gabriel Godfroy (1834–1910), described by Dunn as "the best Miami interpreter in
                    Indiana," was seventy years old in 1905, an aging and irreplaceable source of Indian lore
                    and knowledge of the Miami language. Godfroy's family were among the few Miamis left in
                    Indiana when the tribe was moved to 
                        Kansas
                    , and Godfroy grew up near 
                        Peru
                     on a half section of land that had been left to the family. By 1905 most of his
                    property had been sold to help other Indians in the community, and he was a respected, pleasant,
                    good-hearted old man. Another important source was the even older Kilsokwa, a granddaughter of
                    Little Turtle reputed to be in her nineties in 1905.27

            Dunn's Miami language study led him naturally to make comparisons wherever possible with
                    other, affiliated languages. He researched Potawatomi words with native speakers of the language in
                    1905, and he also made extensive use of earlier published lists of Miami words by
                    François Volney (recorded in 1798) and Charles N. Handy (1850).28
                    There were two major outcomes from Dunn's early Miami language work: first, he published a
                    series of articles on Indian lore in 1907 and 1908, which were collected in a volume entitled True Indian Stories in 1908; second, he was actually hired by the Bureau of
                    Ethnology to continue the work on Miami and 
                        Peoria
                     languages begun by a 
                        German
                     scholar in linguistics, Albert Samuel Gatschet, who died in 1907 after twenty-eight
                    years with the bureau as an expert on Indian languages. Because of Dunn's work on the Miami
                    and Potawatomi languages, Gatschet's annotated collections of texts and vocabularies were
                    made available to Dunn, and he was commissioned in 1908 and 1909 to check Gatschet's texts
                    with Gabriel Godfroy and an Oklahoma Miami woman, Sarah Wadsworth.29
            
            In order to do the work Dunn traveled to Oklahoma to consult Miami Indians there. After his trip in
                    April-May, 1909, Dunn was struck with the urgency of recording the language, since it was nearly
                    extinct, and urged the bureau to support Miami verb studies especially. Meanwhile he collected texts
                    from Miamis and forwarded them, with interlinear translations, to the Bureau of Ethnology, along
                    with a report on Miami verbs. Dunn returned to Oklahoma for more visits in 1910, 1912, 1913, and
                    1914, and he was visited in 
                        Indianapolis
                     from time to time by some of his Miami sources. From 1911 to 1913 the bureau
                    commissioned Dunn to work on making a Miami-English dictionary based on an early eighteenth century 
                        Peoria
                    -French dictionary compiled by a priest in the Illinois country. He completed only the
                    sections from "Abbaiser" to "Bercer" before the
                    bureau's support for the project ceased.30
            
            Perhaps the bureau was reluctant to continue to support a linguistic amateur. Perhaps Dunn's
                    political career seemed an obstacle to these researches—he was appointed city controller
                    again in 1914 and served two years in that position during an

                     politics, since both the Democratic mayor and the defeated Democratic senatorial
                    candidate were indicted for election fraud during his term.31 Perhaps the bureau
                    simply had more urgent uses for its limited budget.
            In any event Dunn was not to receive further support for his Miami studies, though he tried
                    unsuccessfully in 1916 to organize a Society for the Preservation of Indian Languages. He continued
                    to work on the dictionary when he could spare the time, and he wrote several more articles on Indian
                    languages and lore for national magazines.32 He was also an enthusiastic
                    supporter of national efforts to identify and preserve Indian prehistory through archaeological
                    sites in Indiana. In 1920 Dunn urged the annual Indiana History Conference to support the systematic
                    county-by-county archaeological surveys proposed by the National Research Council. He recommended
                    that the surveys "be undertaken by a trained person under the direction of the Conservation
                    Commission" and—always aware of the realities of Indiana politics—he
                    moved that a committee be appointed to lobby for appropriations to fund the work.33
            
            Though Dunn did not live to see his language studies published and recognized for the major piece of
                    scholarly rescue that they were, his work has been preserved. The dictionary was edited by a major
                    linguistic scholar, Carl F. Voegelin (later distinguished professor of anthropology at Indiana
                    University) and published in the Indiana Historical Society's Prehistory
                        Research Series, funded by Eli Lilly, in five numbers between 1938 and 1940. Voegelin
                    praised his predecessor Dunn for his bold and sensible orthography and used Dunn's work
                    with little editing.34 Thus, while the Miami language died as a spoken language,
                    Dunn succeeded in preserving it as a cultural artifact and a tool for anthropological researchers.
            Dunn, the personal man as distinguished from the Democrat and the historian, has an independent
                    appeal one can scarcely resist mentioning. His daughter recalls him traipsing around in rather baggy
                    clothes, mushrooms tucked in his pockets. He was a dedicated mushroom gourmet, forever searching

                    them in batter) and morrells. He also carried his notes around with him in his pockets, and he
                    interviewed his sources with such a warm interest and at such length that it seriously delayed his
                    work. He was a naturalist and often formed study groups of youngsters to go exploring the
                    countryside on the interurbans. His domestic life seems to have been remarkably
                    pleasanh—ither because of or despite the fact that he was surrounded by women. His
                    household consisted of a wife, a mother-in-law, a sister-in-law, and two daughters—all
                    very capable, articulate women. Caroline Dunn (his daughter, the former librarian of the Indiana
                    Historical Society Library) remarks with a smile that she always thought he was very easygoing to
                    put up with all this.35
            
            Still, one wonders whether the adventures of Jape Dunn's old age do not reflect his desire
                    to escape from this female-dominated home into an unambiguously masculine world. In December,
                    1921—when he was nearly sixty-seven years old and still quite a vigorous
                    man—Dunn went to 
                        Haiti
                     to look for manganese. His trip was arranged by one of his wife's relatives,
                    the president of the Haitian-American Sugar Company. Dunn, a rather droll man, let it be thought
                    that he was going to Santo Domingo to look for Christopher 
                        Columbus
                    's lost mine. In his several-month stay in 
                        Haiti
                     he apparently did not find manganese, but he did find himself intrigued by Haitian
                    dialects and collected material for later articles about the subject.36
            
            Returning in February, 1922, from one adventure, Dunn embarked again on a political campaign that led
                    to another adventure. He worked as private secretary for former governor Samuel M. Ralston in
                    Ralston's quest for the 
                        United States
                     Senate. Ralston defeated Albert J. Beveridge in November, and he took Dunn with him to 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., as his most trusted friend and political confidant. Dunn had an exciting period
                    as a 
                        Washington
                     insider before he began to receive warnings that his adventures were nearly over. He
                    had apparently been infested by some tropical disease during his months in 
                        Haiti
                    , and he had several bouts of illness and acute jaundice before he died in 1924.37

                     vineyards. On the national level he did yeoman work among
                    government documents and official reports to sort out Indian-white relationships in the Far West
                    both before and after the Civil War. He preserved a record of the Miami language unique in its
                    extensiveness and careful research. If Indian history and culture are important, then
                    Dunn's work is important. On the local level he prepared long and ambitious narratives of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and of Indiana, filled with vivid characterizations and shrewd analysis based on
                    tenacious research and a sensitive use of a multiplicity of sources. It must remain for another
                    historiographer to place Dunn authoritatively within the larger community of local historians in the
                    late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. An impressionistic survey of roughly contemporary,
                    similar-sized histories of American cities, however, suggests that Greater 
                            Indianapolis
                        
                is rare indeed in its combination of readability, scholarship, and critical
                    spirit. If local history is important—if the state and the city are worth remembering and
                    attempting to understand—then Jacob Piatt Dunn was an important historian.
            Without professional training in history, without the support apparatus of a university or historical
                    society appointment, without bold theses or exalted narrative, Dunn wrote historical works that
                    still are used and respected from sixty to nearly a hundred years after they were written. One could
                    regret that Dunn never found (and perhaps never even sought) a career as a full-time historian.
                    Perhaps with a Ph.D. he would have ranked among the great names of that first generation of
                    professional historians. Alternatively, one might regret that Dunn was not born into great
                    prominence and wealth, so that he could have been Indiana's Henry Adams or Henry Cabot
                    Lodge. But many of the virtues demonstrated in Dunn's work—his knowledge of the
                    workaday world and of how politics and society worked in the early nineteenth
                    century—were presumably acquired by leading the fully engaged life of a journalist and a
                    politician. Perhaps neither an ivory tower nor the cushion of power and wealth would have produced
                    the special perspective of a Jacob Dunn.
            So, one has to wonder—at least tentatively, and in a quiet voice—whether the
                    professionalization of history has brought unmitigated benefits. Dunn's life and work show
                    the value of the historian engagé—in the middle of life, taking his knocks and
                    giving as good as he got. Insofar as history is the art of understanding how human beings in
                    specific societies have dealt with the urgent issues of their day and how they made decisions and
                    how institutions worked, surely there is value in the historian's wide knowledge of the
                    real world, outside the cloister of the college  and the
                    university. Dunn in his modest way poses a challenge to a profession in which many lack both breadth
                    of education and a firsthand knowledge of what work and politics and social institutions are like
                    outside the profession.
            Finally, it is striking that as acrimonious a partisan as Dunn was in his political writing, he was a
                    fair-minded historian, both of the remote and of the more recent past. In some ways Dunn's
                    histories seem characteristically "progressive": he tended to be legalistic in
                    evaluating issues, and he allotted economic issues a large role in his analyses of both Indian
                    policy in the Far West and the slavery controversy in the Indiana Territory. He sometimes asserted
                    pride in his state and section, as when he expressed his conviction that western
                    men—Indiana men—rejected slavery without direction from Congress. And in his
                    historical writing as well as in his editorials he sometimes allowed himself to be exasperated with
                    the evasion of responsibility and frequent stinginess of the Indiana legislature.
            Yet there was little of the muckraker in Dunn's histories: his work is notable for his
                    ability to understand and sympathize with the motivations of both sides of most disputes. Moreover,
                    he does not reflect the tremendous confidence in the possibilities of progress that one expects from
                    progressives: there is a feeling for tragedy in Dunn. He expresses a sense of hopelessness, for
                    example, in contemplating Indian-white relationships. He rails against injustice, claims that the
                    situation has possibilities for improvement, but he also comments with resignation that the
                    discovery of gold was "a greater evil [for the Indians] than any other one event in the
                    history of America, except the discovery of America itself. Gold," he admits, "is
                    a magnet that draws with irresistible force. No power has yet been found able to counteract its
                        attraction."38
            
            Dunn believed deeply in the importance of preserving historical records and cultural artifacts. While
                    he rarely had a strong thesis to advance, he had tremendous respect for the past and an almost
                    tender desire to preserve the memory of individuals, events, and institutions. For Dunn, clearly and
                    intuitively, his job was to capture and communicate the past "wie es eigen-tlich
                    gewesen," a goal dismissed as both impossible and unworthy by Progressive historians like
                    Turner and Beard. However unrealistic and naive the Rankean goal, its virtues are impressively clear
                    in Dunn's work, where his sensitive respect for his material often allows the reader a
                    brief, forceful encounter with the past.

            Tecumseh was, arguably, the single greatest Indian leader in history. So great was his reputation
                    that William Henry Harrison campaigned for the presidency on the claim that he had defeated him in
                    battle, while Richard M. Johnson later ran for vice-president using the boast that he had slain him.
                    Allies and enemies alike recognized his greatness both before and after his death. Yet this great
                    Indian leader, so important to the early history of Indiana and the Old Northwest, has so far
                    escaped the pen of a great biographer.
            R. David Edmunds published The Shawnee Prophet in 1983 in an attempt to correct the
                    emphasis that popular historians had placed on Tecumseh by showing that it was Tenskwatawa,
                    Tecumseh's brother, who first forged the pan-Indian movement in the Old Northwest with his
                    religious revivalism. Far from riding the coattails of his more charismatic brother, it was
                    Tenskwatawa who provided the focal point for Indian unity. According to Edmunds, Tecumseh did not
                    emerge as the movement's leader until after the Treaty of 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in 1809. While Ed-munds's book certainly offered a much-needed corrective to
                    previous historians' dismissal of Tenskwatawa's spiritual movement, his blanket
                    argument for the supremacy of Tenskwatawa over Tecumseh before 1809 is still a debatable point.
            Edmunds presents the same interpretation of the relative influence of the Prophet and Tecumseh in his
                    new book, Tecumseh and the Quest for Indian Leadership. Large sections of this
                    brief biography are devoted to the Prophet and his religious movement. Since Tecumseh does not begin
                    to emerge as the dominant force in the Indian confederacy until after 1809, since he does not become
                    the undisputed leader of the movement until after the Prophet's defeat at the Battle of
                    Tippecanoe in 1811, and since he is then slain in battle in 1813, Tecumseh's moment in
                    history's spotlight is indeed quite brief. Edmunds's interpretation of Tecumseh
                    tends to undercut his importance, and the book becomes almost a joint biography of the two Indian
                    brothers.
            No historian is better qualified to write on Tecumseh and his movement than Edmunds, and this book is
                    ably written in a clear and lucid style. The author is especially good at clarifying

            Within the constraints of the Library of American Biography series, Edmunds has
                    done a fine job of presenting a complicated and important era of history in a refreshing,
                    interesting manner. The book should find wide usage on college campuses, the audience at which this
                    biography series is aimed. General readers, however, may come away from Tecumseh
                    disappointed, Edmunds emphasizes events over personalities and scholarship over high drama. Few
                    tales offer the epic sweep of Tecumseh's tragic story; yet, the author often seems
                    purposefully to neglect rich opportunities to add color and drama to the narrative. In

                    strokes that might have made his book more exciting reading. Nevertheless, this is still the best
                    biography of Tecumseh. It is a careful reconstruction of a man and his era that will prove of great
                    interest to readers of the Indiana Magazine of History. Readers can only hope that
                    Edmunds will again turn his considerable talents to this topic in the future, when he will not be

            Susanah Mayberry has written a brief account of her memories of her illustrious great-uncle, with
                    whom she and the other youngsters of the large Tarkington-Jameson family were thoroughly enamored.
                    Although her personal recollections of one of Indiana's most famous and prolific authors
                    deal with only the last fifteen or twenty years of Booth Tarkington's life (he died in
                    1947), the book is supplemented with a brief biographical sketch of the writer's earlier
                    years. This information is taken largely from the work of James Woodress, Tarkington's
                    major biographer who also supplied in the introduction to Mayberry's book a most useful
                    overview of Tarkington's career and significance as a writer, and from the autobiographical
                    fragment, "As I Seem to Me," that Tarkington published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1941.
            In some ways this is an exasperating book; rambling and disorganized, it often loses its supposed
                    focus on Tarkington while offering instead long passages on the author's young, full, and,
                    yes, pampered life during her famous relative's declining years. According to the
                    author's personal reminiscences, however, the highlights of her youth and adolescence were
                    her many visits to the Tarkingtons, either at their showplace home in 
                        Indianapolis
                     or at their mansion, Seawood, in Kennebunkport, 
                        Maine
                    . Amid the surfeit of details about the luxurious home furnishings and even
                    "The Game" (p. 79) of charades played frequently at the Tarkingtons, there emerges
                    useful and at times fascinating tidbits of information about Tarkington's impish nature,
                    his lifelong delight in practical jokes, and the way in which he drew  upon episodes in family life for some of the raw materials for his
                    stories. The book also gives marvelous insight into Tarkington's serious side, his
                    excellent work habits as developed with the encouragement of his devoted second wife, his deep
                    knowledge of art and artists, and his unlikely but abiding friendship with a Jewish intellectual,
                    famed art historian and critic Erwin Panof-sky of 
                        Princeton
                     University.
            Most of the valuable new information and insights into Tarkington's life and character come
                    in the last quarter of the book, which is divided not into chapters but into a series of untitled
                    sections ranging between one and five pages long. Here Tarkington's views as an anti-New
                    Deal conservative but as a humanitarian deeply concerned for the future of the United Nations and
                    for all mankind in the atomic age come through strongly. On balance this is a useful work. One
                    learns a good deal about a fascinating and multitalented man, but the organization of the book and
                    its many digressions make it more difficult than it should be to winnow the grain from the chaff.

                    considered sin is now called "hedonism" and blamed on the media or society in
                    general.
            Theodore Caplow and his team of researchers who revisited 
                        Muncie
                     a half century after Robert and Helen Lynd have two goals in this monograph. One is to
                    describe the actual practice of religion today, correlating it with socioeconomic variables and
                    contrasting it with what the Lynds reported. The other is to test various sociological theories,
                    especially the notion that modernization (in the sense of economic development) causes
                    secularization or irreligion. They note that in such other developed lands as Western Europe and 
                        Japan
                     religion has been fading away dramatically. Such is not the case in America. The people
                    of 
                        Muncie
                     today are more devout and more actively religious than  the people who lived there fifty (or one hundred) years ago.
                    Agnosticism among white collar families is passe, and church participation among blue collar
                    families has increased sharply. Revivals are flourishing, and ministers are unanimous in stating
                    that religion is strong and getting stronger.
            The book can be highly recommended to Protestant lay people and ministers. (Catholics are treated
                    briefly.) Scattered among the tables and theorems are useful details regarding what religion
                    actually means in the lives of men and women, youth, and activists. Historians, however, should be
                    more cautious. Dwight W. Hoover has a chapter narrating the growth of various denominations, but he
                    offers little analysis. The sociologists, by contrast, are too eager to speculate on historical
                    forces. Most of the inhabitants of 
                        Muncie
                     today are not the descendants of the folk the Lynds studied. New
                    people have moved in—especially Appalachian fundamentalists, ethnic Catholics, students,
                    and academics. Since their religious upbringing occurred elsewhere, their religiosity cannot simply
                    be credited to conditions in 
                        Muncie
                    . Each major denomination has long been "nationalized" in terms of
                    ritual, belief, and behavior. To seek the roots of these national forces in a small Indiana city can
                    be misleading. But 
                        Muncie
                     is a good place to learn what Americans think about heaven and hell, and what they are
                    doing about it.

            Make no mistake, this is a solid biography in the very best sense of that word. Straightforward in
                    its narrative, evenhanded in its evaluation of men and measures, and objective to a fault, it is a
                    thoroughly researched and stunningly constructed life of one of the most fascinating, infuriating,
                    and significant statesmen of the Jacksonian era.
            No small measure of Maurice G. Baxter's accomplishment is the skill with which he has sorted
                    through the varied aspects of Webster's career and presented them with clarity and
                    precision, for Daniel Webster was one of a company of men in the antebellum period whose talents and
                    achievements were so great that it is extremely difficult to do them all justice. Webster was a man
                    who contributed substantially to the development of constitutional law and whose vision of an
                    indissoluble Union was almost unique for his time. He was an outstanding politician; he  enjoyed a short but successful diplomatic career; and, of course, his
                    oratory became one of the glories of this nation. All of Webster's noble statements, from
                    those spoken before the justices of the Supreme Court to those intoned in Congress to the many
                    speeches he gave before crowds of Americans gathered to commemorate a special occasion or hear his
                    arguments in defense of American nationalism are quoted in this book. In brief, then, this is an
                    authoritative biography, the best available on Webster. It has none of the adulation of some
                    previous efforts, and it is informed by massive research, especially in original sources, and by a
                    close, careful, and judicious reading of those materials.
            It is impossible to overemphasize the author's evenhandedness with his subject and the other
                    protagonists of his narrative. Even the footnotes bespeak his concern over presenting both sides of
                    an argument. Those historians with whom Baxter obviously disagrees are given a fair presentation of
                    their position. If there is any criticism one can cite about this book, it is its refusal to risk
                    broad generalizations in defense of a position that cannot always be adequately documented. Take,
                    for example, the question of Webster's personal honesty in his financial dealings. Much has
                    been made in the past about his irregular behavior regarding money. Baxter addresses the problem,
                    but instead of coming down hard on either side of the question, he too oft resorts to such
                    conclusions as "there is no proof of such misconduct" (p. 343) or "how
                    much all this helped him financially is unclear" (p. 75). The author is to be commended for
                    insisting on documentary evidence to support a conclusion, but it is a little disappointing not to
                    get a thorough airing of the accusations so that the reader has a grasp of the general character of
                    Webster's behavior. Some historians who are well versed in the sources believe that Webster
                    was guilty of "improper use of secret funds" in winning ratification of the
                    Webster-Ashburton Treaty (p. 585n). Baxter takes the position that "there is no proof of
                    such misconduct" (p. 343). Fair enough. But Webster is not standing before a law docket; he
                    is answering to history. And it would be helpful to know how Baxter would find him on this issue.
            It is churlish to carp because the author has been such a meticulous historian in reaching his
                    conclusions. Suffice it to say that this is a masterful and compelling study of one of the greatest
                    figures of the nineteenth century.

            Robert V. Remini believes that Andrew 
                        Jackson
                     "not only symbolized" his age but served as its "leader and
                    guide to a more  representative society" (p. 317). The
                    detailed development of this theme amply justifies Remini's title. In biography the
                    principal character sometimes becomes lost in a discussion of the times. Here, 
                        Jackson
                    's dominating personality prevails amid controversies over nullification, the
                    bank, the specie circular, the Senate censure resolution and its expunging, Indian removal, and the
                    annexation of 
                        Texas
                    . Remini calls 
                        Jackson
                     courageous, strong, and indomitable: "one of the few genuine heroes to grace
                    the presidency" (p. 403) and "a statesman of the first rank" (p. 23). He
                    admires the Old Hero's "unquenchable love of the Union" and
                    "unshakable trust in democracy" (p. xvii), to say nothing of his vigor in the face
                    of wretched health.
            Remini enjoys accompanying 
                        Jackson
                     "on his journey, even at times when . . . [
                        Jackson
                    ] was testy, arrogant, and surly" (p. xvii). The author nevertheless finds
                    occasion to criticize: 
                        Jackson
                    's "fumbling" of the "appointments process"
                    (p. 292); "mismanagement" of the Texas issue (p. 356); and especially his
                    "inhuman deed"—Indian removal—"accomplished in
                    total violation not only of American principles of justice and law but of ... [his] own strict code
                    of honor" (p. 314).
            Enriching details reinforce many Jacksonian stereotypes; others are demolished. 
                        Jackson
                    , Remini says, "was no illiterate frontiersman, much less a barbarian"
                    (p. 78). He could be eloquent in spite of his unconventional spelling and grammar. Although he had
                    ghostwriters—as with the nullification proclamation—the ideas, conviction,
                    thought, and spirit were his. 
                        Jackson
                    's "final brawl" with John 
                        Quincy
                     Adams contrasts sharply with that of the genteel retirement correspondence between
                    Adams's father and Thomas Jefferson. Remini concedes that with democracy "the
                    country seemed nastier than before. Elegance and gentility had disappeared" (p. 517). White
                    House levees featuring "sooty artificers, evidently fresh from the forge,"
                    confirmed this (p. 148). Visitors could walk in "to see the President and shake his hand
                    (p. 395). 
                        Jackson
                     remains dominant to the end. Remini's death scene spares nothing, not even
                    "one slight convulsion" (p. 524). 
                        Jackson
                     tenderly blessed each member of his family, his friends, and his slaves, who
                    "must try & meet him in heaven." He, of course, would be there.
                    "I want to meet you all ... both white & black" (pp. 524–25).
            After exhaustive research, Remini has written a coherent, analytical, and engrossing book that
                    ingeniously captures the mood and spirit of 
                        Jackson
                     and his times. Necessary as statistical studies still may be, Remini's
                    contribution will not soon be superseded. Statistical documentation must have a human context, and
                    that context Remini has richly provided.

                        Institution, 1840–1878. By Kenneth Hafertepe. (
                        Washington

                    on sources, index. $19.95.)
            In this surprisingly engaging book architectural historian Kenneth Hafertepe sets out to explain how
                    the early intellectual and organizational development of the Smithsonian Institution came to be
                    embodied in its first home, the Smithsonian Building. Rather than the boring mixture of
                    institutional and architectural history that readers might expect, the work is an absorbing tale,
                    vividly told by its author.
            As Hafertepe relates, the founding of the Smithsonian (1846) occurred amid heated debates over what
                    exactly the institution should be and what sort of architecture would best suit its purposes.
                    Motivated by a Byzantine blend of lofty ideals, political factionalism, blatant nepotism, and petty
                    personal animosities, the disputes resolved themselves into a contest of wills between two men:
                    Robert Dale Owen, Democratic congressman from 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, and Joseph Henry, the first secretary of the Smithsonian.
            Owen saw the Smithsonian as a multifaceted institution combining a museum, an art gallery, a library,
                    and research facilities; he believed that this manifold mission would be best expressed and served
                    by a monumental, eight-towered building designed by James Renwick, Jr., in the 
                        Norman
                     (Romanesque) style. Henry wanted only the research center, and he wanted it housed in
                    very simple quarters. In his opinion Owen's and Ren-wick's
                    "castle" was a scandalous waste of money. Henry did succeed in forcing Owen off
                    the Smithsonian's Board of Regents in 1848 and Renwick off the construction project in
                    1852. However, by that time Owen had codified his views in the Smithsonian's enabling
                    legislation, and he had mustered enough support for Renwick's design to insure its
                    completion. In essence, Owen stuck Henry with a charter and a building, and the latter spent his
                    thirty-two years as secretary (1846–1878) in a futile attempt to get rid of them both.
                    The Smithsonian Institution as it is known today reflects Robert Dale Owen's vision, not
                    Joseph Henry's.
            On the whole, Hafertepe does an admirable job of elucidating the complexities of the
                    Smithsonian's formative decades. Granted, the subject matter of his book seems highly
                    esoteric at first glance. Nonetheless, America's Castle is heartily
                    recommended to anyone with a specialized interest in museums or nineteenth century architecture or
                    with a broader concern for the ways in which politics and personalities have helped to shape
                    America's cultural institutions.

                    bibliographic notes, notes, index. $24.95.)
            The plow that broke the plains, we have been told, was the self-polishing steel moldboard plow, and
                    John Deere invented it. Wayne G. Broehl, Jr., demolishes this myth without ceremony in the first few
                    pages of this superb history of the company that Deere founded in 1838 in Grand Detour, 
                        Illinois
                    , to make his version of a steel plow. Several other blacksmiths had the same idea at
                    about the same time, but Deere & Company grew to be the second largest and most vigorous
                    agricultural implement manufacturer in the 
                        United States
                    .
            This is business history at its finest. While the author wisely lets events spin their own narrative
                    web, he provides a running analysis of the significance of an endless stream of corporate matters to
                    the larger story of American agriculture and industry. His story fits the modern view of big
                    business history as largely the story of a firm's growth, diversification, integration
                    (especially forward into marketing through a superb branch-house and dealer organization),
                    attainment of modern administrative methods, and emergence on the multinational scene. The general
                    historian will learn a lot from Broehl's story of a group of high-minded, stubborn,
                    midwestern American businessmen plodding from one problem to another, practicing the painful art of
                    trial-and-error, and often arriving at what seems in retrospect an obvious solution only after
                    repeated mistakes.
            This monumental, beautifully illustrated study teems with rich detail, from the most prosaic problems
                    of product planning to delicate questions of leadership in a family-controlled firm that was being
                    less and less well served by nepotism. Deere & Company faced such major problems as whether
                    to add harvesters to their line; whether to go into tractors, and if so, how; and whether to
                    establish their own subsidiaries in Europe and elsewhere. It is hard to imagine a future book or
                    article on the evolution of American agriculture that will not benefit from a close reading of John Deere's Company or that will fail to quote from it.
            Broehl, historians should note, had the rare good fortune to work with well-preserved and relatively
                    complete corporate records. Many American business historians have not been so lucky, for few
                    corporate executives see the preservation of their past as an important corporate goal. Perhaps it
                    is not surprising that Deere & Company should be an exception. Indeed, the American  West seems far more alive to the importance of its history than
                    the American East, where the here-today-gone-tomorrow philosophy of the
                    "professional" manager holds sway. Enterprises that bear some of the oldest names
                    in New 
                        England
                     history, for example, destroy even their most routine administrative records when they
                    have been around five years. But few of these enterprises have spent 150 years as close to the heart
                    of the American story as Deere & Company, and that is probably what has made the difference.

            "My God! Come and see them run!" Tom 
                        Jackson
                     shouted to his buddies of the Sixth Indiana Volunteers (p. 202) at the climax of the
                    unplanned and dramatic assault by the Union Army of the 
                        Cumberland
                     that routed the Confederate army from its strong position on the crest of Missionary
                    Ridge, east of 
                        Chattanooga
                    . This action ended the siege of the Federal army in 
                        Chattanooga
                     during the autumn of 1863 and gave the Union a secure base for General William T.
                    Sherman's 
                        Atlanta
                     Campaign and March to the Sea the following year. Thus, the capture of Missionary Ridge
                    could be called the beginning of the end of the Confederacy.
            As McDonough says in the preface, no full, documented history of the siege and important battles
                    around 
                        Chattanooga
                     had been published, and he has corrected this omission with a very readable account. In
                    it he has included much previously unpublished material including officers' after-action
                    reports and soldiers' diaries and letters. He has combined this material with reports in
                    the Official Records and other published sources to write an excellent story about
                    the siege and fighting at 
                        Chattanooga
                     including the so-called Battle above the Clouds on Lookout Mountain.
            The story includes interesting details about the indecisiveness of Confederate General Braxton Bragg
                    and the bickering and backbiting of the Confederate high command that contributed to the ultimate
                    Rebel defeat. McDonough did not tell of some important Union decisions that aided the victorious
                    outcome. For example, on page 58 he tells of General Joseph Hooker's command marching from
                            
                  Bridgeport, Alabama
               , to help open  a supply
                    line into 
                        Chattanooga
                    , leaving the reader to wonder why and how these new troops happened to be where they
                    were.
            The book contains excellent maps showing troop positions in the various actions. The selection and
                    quality of other illustrations are poor. Some contemporary photographs of 
                        Chattanooga
                    , perhaps from the National Archives collection, would have made the book more
                    interesting. Some of the seventeen full-page pictures of generals could have been omitted or reduced
                    in size to make room for them.
            The excellent text and new information included in the book make 
                        
                            Chattanooga
                        
                     a fine addition for the libraries of Civil War students and buffs. While only scattered
                    references are made to Indiana soldiers, some 20 percent of the regiments involved in the siege
                    itself and in the final assault on Missionary Ridge were from Indiana; thus, the book is a part of
                    Indiana's heritage.

            In Bonds of Enterprise Purdue University Professor John Lauritz Larson offers a
                    case study of the complex process through which the development of railroads in the nineteenth
                    century transformed the country "from a rural agrarian republic into a continental
                    industrial nation" (p. xv). His focus is on the interaction between eastern-based
                    financiers, builders, and operators of the new roads, represented by John 
                        Murray
                     Forbes, and western interests, represented by Iowa farmers, merchants, and politicians.
            This is an ambitious study. It begins with a description of Forbes's early experience in the 
                        China
                     trade in the 1820s and 1830s, then traces his role in the financing and management of
                    western railroads, chiefly the 
                  Chicago, Burlington
                and 
                        Quincy
                     Railroad, until his death in 1898. In this context Larson discusses the growing
                    confrontation between Forbes and his associates and Iowans over questions of the proper distribution
                    of costs and benefits derived from railroad development in that state. The passage of statutes
                    regulating Iowa railroads he describes as a necessary, but not always helpful, solution to these
                    disputes. Throughout the book Larson emphasizes overriding themes, chief among them a growing
                    conflict between the concepts of "free popular government and free capitalist
                    enterprise"  (p. 197)—a conflict that
                    resulted from the inability of Iowa communities to maintain control of their economic destinies as
                    major railroads came to dominate state transportation patterns.
            The study has its limitations. It contains a number of overstated generalizations. Connecting
                    discussions of certain portions of Forbes's career to the major thrust of the book is
                    sometimes difficult. At other points Larson appears to stretch to include Forbes in a consideration
                    of issues that extend far beyond the scope of his activities. The author's description of
                    the motives and approaches of eastern investors is far more convincing than his treatment of
                    positions taken by farmers, merchants, and politicians in 
                        Iowa
                    . (Protesting Iowans are often characterized as simply failing to comprehend the coming
                    of a new economic order.)
            Still, this is a useful book, worthy of review by anyone who is interested in the history of
                    railroads, nineteenth century American economic history, or the development of government regulation
                    in the last decades of the century. Written in a clear, if not compelling, prose, it is a good study
                    of the process through which the development of railroads brought about fundamental changes in
                    American attitudes and institutions.

            This is railroad history with a new look. H. Roger Grant and his publisher have successfully blended
                    the corporate biography with the railfan picture book to create a pleasant, brief history of the 
                        Chicago
                     Great Western Railroad. The story begins with four chapters tracing the early firms
                    that made up the CGW in the late nineteenth century. Gradually from this sometimes bewildering mass
                    of details the guiding hand of CGW founder A. B. Stickney comes into view, and the railroad takes
                    shape. The pace of the narrative picks up in chapter five, when reorganization and new leadership
                    give tighter focus to the firm. The remaining chapters march steadily through flush times and bad,
                    corruption, scandal, and innovation, coming to a nostalgic end in 1968 when the CGW merged into the 
                        Chicago
                     and Northwestern. Railroad enthusiasts and local historians (especially Iowans) will
                    find much reward in this volume. It is rich in anecdote and railbuff detail, liberally spiced with
                    editorial copy from period small-town presses, and lavishly illustrated. The large two-  column format and the presence of art on almost every page make this
                    book especially inviting to casual readers.
            Grant's scholarly contribution is less certain. The weakness lies not in the format but in
                    the awkward place of this railroad in history. The standard view is that the CGW should never have
                    been built. Grant labels this "faulty logic" (p. x); he argues instead that the
                    road provided much-needed service to isolated rural communities. But the narrative describes a
                    speculator's railroad, a stem-only line created to raid the traffic centers by offering
                    cheap rates while avoiding the burdens of branch-line service. There were few isolated communities
                    rescued by CGW service. More often new construction followed "air-line" routes
                    that purposefully bypassed existing country towns (p. 27). The company's townsite
                    speculators had trouble locating sites in Iowa where towns were more than ten
                    miles apart (p. 67). In reality, Stickney was exploiting the desires of local capitalists to strike
                    back at monopolistic regional carriers through new competition. Grant sees this as reform, but
                    Stickney's real objective was long-haul through traffic, not equitable local service.
                    Stickney's maverick scheme for federally mandated "average rates" (p.
                    30–31) not coincidentally promised peculiar advantages for a rate-cutting air-line road
                    with no branch network subsidizing its long hauls. In the end Congress never fixed rates, and
                    Stickney's railroad was simply a rogue line that benefited some shippers, many of whom
                    already enjoyed competitive service.
            By wrapping the origins of the CGW in images of reform, service, and rural development, Grant
                    deprives readers of the best reason why the CGW survived as a chronic innovator and a gadfly in the
                    competitive interstices between larger railroad systems. Scrappy concerns like the CGW were forced
                    to explore novelties that moved the industry—for good or ill—off dead center.
                    Exciting experiments with gasoline motorcars and shady financing through the Bremo Corporation could
                    be seen not just as good and bad moves respectively but as equally logical products of this kind of
                    railroad. The undulating fortunes of the CGW in the twentieth century might well document the
                    continuing role of enterprise in a regulated, bureaucratic industry, which might in turn establish
                    for the company the historical importance Grant seeks. But the argument is too lightly handled here;
                    historians will want a larger frame and a more forceful interpretation of the history of the Corn
                    Belt Route.

                    $37.95.)
            This is a gem of a book—small but valuable! It is a detailed, well-documented, balanced
                    account of a 1942 race riot in 
                        Detroit
                     connected with black occupation of a housing project bordering a white ethnic
                    neighborhood.
            Dominic J. Capeci, Jr., sets the stage by tracing the history of race relations in 
                        Detroit
                     from the Civil War through the introduction of restricted covenants in 1910 to the
                    creation of a black ghetto in the 1920s. He demonstrates severe inadequacies in health care,
                    education, and housing for 
                        Detroit
                    's black population in 1940, as well as a racially biased city police force. He
                    indicates that when the riot occurred high paying war jobs, earlier available only to whites, had
                    just opened up for blacks, increasing racial tensions in the workplace. Capeci's main
                    thesis is that the 1942 race riot marked a transition from an older system of race relations based
                    on white dominance and black submission to a new more equitable racial situation in 
                        Detroit
                    . He contends that failure to appreciate the significance of the 1942 riot and the
                    strength of the social forces behind it resulted in the larger more serious riot of 1943.
            Capeci's account of the disturbance over the housing project is based on a wide range of
                    sources: files of the Justice Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Association for
                    the Advancement of Colored People, and Urban League; the Labor Archives of Wayne State University;
                    and the local press. He painstakingly dissects the 
                        Detroit
                     community to display the complex network of social relationships within the city and
                    the pressures on them as war production drew in thousands of newcomers, especially from the South.
            The largely Polish 7-Mile Fenelon Improvement Association, led by two Italian realtors, opposed black
                    occupation of the Sojourner Truth Homes near their area. Congressman Rudolph G. Tenerowicz supported
                    them, as did some Catholic priests, Fundamentalist Protestants, Ku Klux Klan members, and other
                    right wingers. The Citizens Committee supporting the move included most black organizations, white
                    liberals, Communists, and top leaders in the United Automobile Workers Union. For the union the
                    issue was internally divisive, as its membership mirrored the entire community.
            Compounding the problems were the vacillating behavior of the mayor and incredible bureaucratic
                    confusion. Federal and  local housing agencies made different
                    decisions and gave conflicting promises to community groups. One section of the Federal Housing
                    Administration decided to proceed with black occupation while another section refused guaranteed FHA
                    loans in 7-Mile Fenelon Park if blacks moved near it. Capeci's story is as complex as life
                    itself and sheds much light on the difficult process of social change.

                    , Del.: University of Delaware Press, 1984. Pp. 332. Notes, illustrations, figures,
                    bibliography. $38.50.)
            The distinguished military historian Michael Howard has described logistics as a "forgotten
                    dimension" of strategy. James A. Huston, former professor of history at Purdue, undertook
                    this book in part to elevate the study of logistics to its proper place. Unfortunately, this
                    mediocre volume may deepen scholars' disdain for logistics, not end their neglect of it.
            The book's most serious defect is lack of a unifying theme. Huston has organized the study
                    into four parts. The first, dealing with the origins of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
                    early logistics efforts of the 
                        United States
                    , bears scant relation to what follows. (It also suffers when compared with recent work
                    by Timothy 
                        Ireland
                    , Escott Reid, and Lawrence Kaplan.) The second part describes logistics planning and
                    some of the strategic and logistics dilemmas that the alliance faced. This section, too, stands by
                    itself. The third part—the heart of the book—presents five case studies of
                    NATO logistics programs. The last part contains Huston's conclusions. Here and in the
                    preface he argues that common logistics programs did more to make NATO effective than any other
                    alliance activity. This theme appears nowhere else, not even in part three, where one would most
                    expect it. Instead, these chapters dwell more on limits than accomplishments. Occasional perceptive
                    comments remain isolated and undeveloped. The result is a whole considerably less than the sum of
                    its parts.
            The volume's most frustrating characteristic for a historian is the way Huston ignores time.
                    He often describes events without indicating when they occurred. He will ignore decades and then
                    give detailed descriptions of bureaucratic structures and programs in a particular year. These seem
                    neither typical nor extraordinary, so the criterion for selection is unclear. The uneven treatment
                    distracts, bewilders, and eventually annoys.
            
            The writing is poor. Huston needed a good editor to tighten his prose and give it direction; the
                    press did not provide one. Phrasings are awkward, passive voice abounds, sentences do not relate to
                    one another, and paragraph transitions are weak. Huston has trouble saying simple things simply.
                    Instead of "combat" or "war," for example, he prefers
                    "a war situation" (p. 230), "a war emergency" (p. 231), or,
                    incredibly, "a war emergency situation" (p. 229). Careful proofreading would have
                    eliminated the numerous typographical errors that litter the manuscript.
            In short, while the history of NATO logistics is an important subject, Huston's treatment of
                    it is best forgotten.

               JFK: The Presidency of John F. Kennedy. By Herbert S. Parmet. (

                    : Dial Press, 1983. Pp. viii, 407. Notes, index. $19.95.)
            The second in a two-volume biography of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, this book should remain for some
                    time as the most thoughtful and accurate of many books on the subject. Based on published accounts,
                    memoirs, oral histories, and special studies such as the Pentagon Papers and the
                    Church Committee investigation of the Central Intelligence Agency, it considers both the man and his
                    era—the public and private together, the admirable with the commonplace. The picture that
                    emerges is of an extraordinarily poised, graceful, witty, inspiring, and handsome but fully human
                    individual. Kennedy had a capacity for error, a large ego, a desire to satisfy the high expectations
                    of his father, an attraction to women, and a chronic back ailment, but he was a president who was
                    courageous in his loyalty to nation and to constitutional democracy. Personally ambitious and master
                    of electoral politics, unfortunately Kennedy learned the nature and limits of presidential power
                    only after entering the Oval Office. The Kennedy administration, rhetoric to the contrary, was
                    actually a continuation of the Dwight D. Eisenhower policies, with some of the same officials. The
                    youthful Irishman from 
                        Massachusetts
                    , who was the pride of the liberal intellectual establishment, was, it turned out, a
                    budget-balancer by instinct, who worried about deficit spending by the government just as he fretted
                    about the free spending of his wife for dresses. A practical politician who was aware of the
                    narrowness of his victory in 1960, he was unwilling to confront the dominant conservative block of
                    Republicans and Southern Democrats in Congress, advocating civil rights legislation only when forced
                    by disturbances in the  South. In 
                        Cuba
                    , Berlin, and 
                        Laos
                     he accepted Eisenhower's premises about monolithic Communist encroachment, and
                    his actions were in large measure an extension of the general's strategy both military and
                    covert—using the CIA. He kept the former president informed about foreign affairs and
                    from time to time sought his support, though not his advice. Unfortunately he lacked the Republican
                    president's ability. His handling of the Bay-of-Pigs incident and the situation in 
                        Vietnam
                     were inept.
            The few weaknesses of the book include instances of carelessness, such as calling Eugene Zukert the
                    secretary of war instead of the secretary of the air force (p. 140) and the Skyhawk fighter airplane
                    the Skylark (p. 171). There are also periodic excursions into side issues or wordy nonsense, such as
                    "Kennedy's only real recourse on 
                        Laos
                     was to maneuver between what he was actually doing and what he appeared to be
                    doing" (p. 136). The author clarifies some important issues but obscures others. He is
                    persuasive in showing the coolness between JFK and Jacqueline because of her lack of interest in
                    politics and his affairs with other women, the strength of the president's commitment to an
                    independent 
                        South Vietnam
                     (he probably would have kept American troops there), and the lack of evidence that Lee
                    Harvey Oswald was part of a conspiracy. He is less convincing when he fails to discuss the
                    possibility that Soviet offensive weapons in 
                        Cuba
                     were a response both to Kennedy's continuing buildup of strategic weapons
                    after finding out that the "missile gap" was a myth and to his apparent lack of
                    resolve at the Bay-of-Pigs and at the summit meeting in 
                  Vienna, Austria
               . Parmet
                    emphasizes instead that the president had no choice after discovering Soviet missiles in 
                        Cuba
                     but to act militarily and publicly. Khrushchev had lied. Kennedy had vowed not to allow
                    offensive weapons into the hemisphere, and there were pressures on the White House with Republican
                    Senators Kenneth B. Keating of 
                        New York
                     and Homer E. Capehart of Indiana calling for an invasion of the island with a communist

               Scholars and the Indian Experience: Critical Reviews of Recent Writing in the Social

            Since the 1960s the study of Native American history has undergone major changes. Once envisioned as
                    part of a more  general field in the history of the American
                    West, Indian history has recently emerged as a viable, separate field of historical inquiry.
                    Incorporating an ethnohistorical approach, the "new Indian history" now focuses
                    more sharply upon the Indians. The D'Arcy McNickle Center for the History of the American
                    Indian at the Newberry Library has been instrumental in championing this new approach, and this
                    volume is part of their continuing bibliographical series.
            The volume contains ten historiographical essays focusing on the broad spectrum of the Indian
                    experience. In chapter one Dean Snow surveys recent writing on North American prehistory, while
                    chapter two contains Henry Dobyns's discussion of current reappraisals of Native American
                    demography. Editor William R. Swagerty devotes the third chapter to a broad discussion of
                    Spanish-Indian relations, and Frederick Fauz discusses contemporary investigations of British-Indian
                    relations. Fauz's essay, which describes the evolution of ethnohistorical inquiry and its
                    impact upon the history of the northeastern tribes, is one of the most perceptive chapters in the
                    volume. Frederick Hoxie surveys the literature of Indian-white relations between 1790 and 1900,
                    while Donald Fixico focuses upon federal Indian policy in the twentieth century. Fixico's
                    chapter contains a good discussion of the historiography pertaining to legal issues that have
                    plagued the tribes since 1900. In chapter seven Russell Thornton, a sociologist, discusses recent
                    literature on subjects such as Indian education, urbanization, health, and economic development.
                    Richard White focuses his essay on Indians' relationship to their environment, while Peter
                    Iverson surveys recent developments in tribal histories. Finally, Jacqueline Peterson and John
                    Anfinson conclude the volume with a perceptive analysis of the recent literature on Indians in the
                    fur trade. Peterson and Anfinson chronicle the shifting emphasis away from depicting Indians as
                    foils for white fur traders and illustrate that new studies present a more sophisticated
                    investigation of the role that both Indian men and women played in this commerce.
            The volume has some predictable flaws. As with any survey of "current" literature,
                    the essays are somewhat dated before the volume reaches print, and some of the subject matter in the
                    separate chapters overlaps. These minor problems aside, this is a very useful study that describes
                    the modern "state of the art" in Native American historiography. It should be well
                    received by both historians and anthropologists and should be required reading for any graduate
                    courses in Indian history or historiography.

               The Christian College: A History of Protestant Higher Education in America. By
                    William C. Ringenberg. (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Christian University Press and William B. Eerdmans
                    Publishing Company, 1984. Pp. x, 257. Tables, notes, index. Paperbound, $11.95.)
            This book purports to be a general history of the Protestant college from the founding of 
                        Harvard
                     to the present day. William C. Ringenberg of Taylor University in Indiana seeks to fill
                    a major gap in the literature on higher education, for there has never existed a scholarly history
                    of Protestant higher education in this country. The author has based his account almost entirely on
                    secondary materials, and he has read widely in these sources. He has summarized much too
                    briefly—in only twelve pages—collegiate history in the seventeenth and
                    eighteenth centuries. The strongest sections are those devoted to the Protestant college in the
                    nineteenth century. The author has incorporated many of the recent revisionist views about the
                    "old-time college" (although his research, which seems to end about 1980, omits
                    some of the most recent revisionist findings). The early years of state universities (as
                    "Protestant colleges"), the beginnings of higher education for blacks and women,
                    the founding of new ethnic colleges, and an outline of how late nineteenth century secular,
                    intellectual, and societal forces pushed the Protestant colleges into accommodation and
                    retreat—all of these topics the author develops with an apparent sure hand.
            The material on the twentieth century, where historical scholarship is less well developed, is not as
                    satisfactory. The author provides a useful and significant summary of the development of
                    "Bible colleges" and "fundamentalist" schools like Bob Jones
                    University, a dimension of American higher education which has long needed a chronicler among
                    professional historians. But Ringenberg allows his personal biases to intrude too much. In his final
                    chapters the narrative becomes too much an apologia for the so-called "evangelical
                    colleges." Statements such as "Christian professors usually know non-Christian
                    views in their disciplines better than non-Christian professors understand Christian interpretations
                    . . . Therefore, Christian professors can present a broader variety of perspectives" (p.
                    146) are unfortunate assertions, considerably removed from careful historical analysis.
            Note should also be made of an excellent introductory essay by Mark Noll. Noll's
                    contribution neatly summarizes major theological and intellectual trends that shaped Protestant
                    higher education in America from Jonathan Edwards to the twentieth  century. Noll's essay effectively complements
                    Ringenberg's work, but he also tends toward a lack of balance when discussing twentieth
                    century developments, especially after 1925, in so-called Christian higher education. Noll writes
                    with a verve and clarity that makes for stimulating reading; it is unfortunate that there is no
                    recognition of his contribution on the title page of this book.
            In summary, Ringenberg-Noll have been only partially successful in what they have attempted. Their
                    analytical-interpretive efforts work reasonably well until they move into more recent materials. To
                    this reader their eventual switch from historical analysis to apologetic for the evangelical college
                    is jarring and ill-considered, and it leaves one with a bit of a sour taste and uneasy feelings at
                    the end.

                    Stephen Miller. (

                    : University Press of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 1984. Pp. 192. Notes, index. $17.00.)
            Stephen Miller's Excellence & Equity: The National Endowment for the
                        Humanities is one of a very few book-length studies of the founding, work, and structure of
                    NEH. It arrived in bookstores and on library shelves in 1984 just before the work of the endowment
                    was to be subjected to the intense scrutiny occasioned by Congressional hearings aimed at
                    reauthorizing the legislation that created the agency.
            These hearings are taking place in 1985 and, as usual, have brought on a season of concern about the
                    future of the federal role in support of the humanities in the 
                        United States
                    . The coincidence of the onset of these hearings with the search for a new chairman for
                    the Endowment and the annual review of federal budget allocations has brought NEH under close
                    observation. Miller could not have predicted the search for a new chairman, nor could he have known
                    of the battle looming over budget expenditures for "middle class" programs. There
                    can be little doubt, however, that the author of Excellence & Equity
                    intended to have his say when reauthorization of the Endowment's enabling legislation was
                    considered.
            On balance, Miller's work is informative and helpful. He does his readers a significant
                    service by pointing out and describing in detail important facts about NEH and its work. He makes
                    the clear and convincing argument that anyone who wants to understand NEH must first understand the
                    politics that gave birth to the Endowment and have influenced its work since the beginning.  Those who want to talk about NEH "in vacuo,"
                    apart from the political facts of life in 
                        Washington
                     over the last twenty years, are either naive or seeking intentionally to mislead their
                    listeners. NEH is not a private foundation; it is a creature of the mixture of political interest,
                    public need, impassioned persuasion, and interest-group pressure. Miller does a good job of
                    demonstrating that such has been the case under both Republican and Democratic administrations. His
                    weakest analysis of the history of politics at the Endowment relates to the period of William
                    Bennett's chairmanship. This is not just an oversight in the book, but a significant
                    inadequacy.
            One of Miller's other important themes is a discussion of the sources, nature, and effects
                    of the conflicts in understanding of mission that have plagued (or blessed?) NEH since its founding.
                    Miller does a good job of describing the central debate over whether NEH should concentrate most of
                    its resources on scholarship and the academy or major public projects, but he is obviously biased in
                    favor of an Endowment focused on support for pure scholarship. The problem with his analysis is that
                    his advocacy of such an Endowment reveals a bias unsupported by substantive argument and detailed
                    persuasion. Miller seeks to apply rigorous standards of judgment to the public programs funded by
                    NEH but hardly ever comments on the value, effectiveness, or suitability of NEH funding for more
                    scholarly pursuits. His analysis thus rests on an implicit double standard.
            In the midst of the current debate about the federal budget deficit, Miller's book reminds
                    readers that NEH funding accounts for only a very small amount of the resources devoted to the
                    humanities in the 
                        United States
                    . This resource should be used to the best possible advantage or it should not be used
                    at all. Humanists should welcome the tests of need and excellence as determining factors in
                    decisions concerning the future of federal funding for the humanities. Miller rightly argues the
                    need for such standards.
            The weakest part of Miller's book is his concluding chapter. His "Conclusions and
                    Recommendations" are for the most part a list of unsupported and highly personal prejudices
                    with which the reader may gladly agree or disagree. These recommendations lack real substance and in
                    some cases are unduly vague by virtue of loose language and lack of definition. Miller and his
                    readers would have been better served by a concluding chapter that suggested remaining questions
                    about the Endowment rather than one that ends so weakly.
            The biggest fallacy of the book is Miller's insistence that excellence and equity cannot be
                    combined in the grant work of  NEH. He closes his study with
                    such a claim. By doing so, he betrays his own prejudice and weakens the perceptive and balanced
                    insight which enrich the better chapters of his study.

               Bluegrass Breakdown: The Making of the Old Southern Sound. By Robert Cantwell. (
                        Urbana
                    : University of Illinois Press, 1984. Pp. xiii, 309. Notes, selected bibliography,
                    index. $19.95.)
            To those who love it, bluegrass music symbolizes and embodies all the past glories of country music
                    set in a dynamic, contemporary, yet traditional music style. Members of the subculture of fans and
                    musicians surrounding the music pride themselves on their involvement with bluegrass. They collect
                    records, attend shows, play and sing the music, and track down its handed-down history until they
                    become emotionally tied to the music. For fans caught in its grip, bluegrass is more than a style of
                    music; it is a kind of fever that affects the mind. Blue-grass Breakdown: The Making of
                        the Old Southern Sound is the first work about bluegrass that communicates the passion of
                    the genre. The book's author, Robert Cantwell, weaves together interviews with the founder
                    of bluegrass, Bill 
                        Monroe
                    , along with bluegrass history, the musicology of bluegrass, and interpretations of the
                    meaning of the music in a way that imbues those things with both scholarly significance and the
                    emotional response of the true believer.
            Cantwell's most significant contribution is his treatment of the singular synthesis of
                    African- and American-derived musical traits that combine to form bluegrass. His analysis of the
                    rhythmic organization of bluegrass music is filled with fine detail, the result of hours of
                    listening many times to records in order to catch all of the nuances. The discussion of bluegrass
                    rhythm, as compared to that of other country music and jazz is valuable, yet sometimes technical,
                    requiring the rudimentary ability to decipher musical notation. Challenging reading it may be to
                    some, but it is worth the effort. Combining acute description of the function of the instruments in
                    a bluegrass band with painstaking notation of bluegrass rhythms, the book fleshes out the often
                    heard, but seldom adequately explained dictum that bluegrass is country music influenced by the
                    blues. Cantwell also shows how the rhythmic interest of bluegrass is a major part of the
                    music's meaning, artistic achievement, and appeal.
            
            Cantwell's sentences are lengthy. Some will say that they are complex and filled with
                    decorative writing to the point of self-indulgence. On the other hand, it is the expansiveness of
                    Cantwell's prose that allows him to embroider the work with bits of bluegrass lore that
                    many will find witty. There is a certain excitement in Cantwell's writing style that, like
                    the dyed-in-the-wool bluegrass fan explaining the bluegrass world view to the novice, smacks of
                    urgently getting-it-all-down before the insights are lost in the mist.
            Previous works about bluegrass, because of their over-attention to the day-to-day histories of bands
                    and musicians or because of their dry recounting of discographic information, fall short of Bluegrass Breakdown. Cantwell has not only presented an expanded and integrated
                    rendition of the body of bluegrass knowledge but has infused it with the very emotional intensity
                    that bluegrass fans attribute to their music.

                    four decades photographing the people and places of southern Indiana's 
                        Brown County
                    , creating a record of a way of life that is no more. His camera ranged from
                    basketmaking to moonshining, from beekeeping to river baptism—often setting off ways that
                    seemed to disappear even as he photographed them. This film presents a selection from the large
                    Hohenberger Collection at Indiana University's Lilly Library, accompanied by a narrator
                    reading relevant selections from Hohenberger's diary. The effect is altogether enjoyable
                    and interesting, and the film will be well received by adult groups and secondary school students.
                    Viewers will doubtless come away with many questions about the meaning of Hohenberger's
                    photographs and about life in the hills of southern Indiana in the early twentieth century. They

                    Lawrence County history from 1884 to 1916. The new book brings the story down to World War II.
                    Guthrie organizes his voluminous material in five sections: government, transportation, business and
                    industry, cultural and social topics, and a miscellaneous section. His focus is on providing large
                    amounts of factual detail, much of it laboriously gathered from local newspapers. There are also
                    many interesting illustrations, a good index, and the time-honored biographical sketches of
                    prominent individuals. Purchase information is available from the author, 1528 25th Street,
