            <p>Few aspects of Afro-American history have aroused such intense debate as the character of the black
                    family. For generations scholars have held that the most crippling effect of slavery was its
                    destruction of family life. They have argued that slavery emasculated the black male by depriving
                    him of his role as breadwinner and displacing family authority onto the white master; that it
                    subjected the black female to sexual and economic exploitation; and that it perpetuated, by the
                    threat of separation by sale, a sense of family impermanence. Slavery created an unstable family
                    life with the mother as the central figure and, after emancipation, placed the black family in a
                    disadvantageous position for competing with whites. Slavery, this traditional argument held, was the
                    major reason for the continuation of black poverty in the urban ghetto. And because of poverty, the
                    pattern of matriarchy continued to exist, since black males responded to menial work and job
                    insecurity by deserting their families. Thus in cities the low status of blacks was rooted in family
                        instability.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    A number of scholars—notably Herbert Gutman—have identified considerably more
                    family stability than previously assumed. Family ties of affection, popularized by Alex Haley in <hi rend="i">Roots: The Saga of an American Family</hi>, provided a substantial resource with which
                    blacks resisted slavery on their own terms.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Several scholars have investigated
                    the federal manuscript population schedules of 1870 and 1880 for information about newly emancipated
                    slaves. These studies have demonstrated the prevalence of two-parent, male-headed families among
                    urban as well as rural blacks. They suggest that the typical black household was not
                    "unorganized and disorganized" and that the urban experience, not the heritage of
                    slavery, was the basic determinant of late nineteenth-century black family life.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                        uses the 1850, 1860, and 1870 manuscript censuses for family information, but since marital
                        status and relation of members of the household to the head of the household were not included
                        until the 1880 census, his conclusions about pre-1880 family life are questionable. The most
                        significant work is that of Gutman, who unfortunately devotes little of his study to the
                        post-Civil War period. Students of Indiana history, moreover, must cope with the absence of any
                        studies of the black family and the paucity of serious black history. The most useful work is

                    of blacks with similar roots and socioeconomic conditions residing in the urban and rural sections
                    of the same county, one can show that not only was the two-parent, male-headed family the most
                    common form in both urban and rural areas, but also that black family structure was altered by the
                    urban experience. Black families responded to the urban setting by developing adaptive devices that
                    permitted the family to survive in its new environment.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                                conditions. More important, the census measured life as it existed on the day the census
                                taker visited and thus provided little information about the fabric of black society.
                                For example, how durable were the two-parent households? Censuses also generally tended
                                to undercount young, poor, and black citizens. Nevertheless, the manuscript census is an
                                extremely valuable source of information about the black community, especially in <placeName>

                            <p>For this study, the family will be defined in the terms used by record keepers of the
                                late nineteenth century—private and public families. A private family
                                included the household head and all persons related to him or her, as well as any
                                boarders or lodgers in the household. Public families included steamboat crews, boarding
                                house residents, and hotel staffs. Such families, as well as single-member households,
                                are excluded from this study. In 1880, there were fifty-seven such instances. The total
                                number of families studied, therefore, is slightly smaller than the number of households
                                in the 1880 census, although the two are nearly synonymous. Furthermore, this study does
                                not classify families listed as boarders and otherwise unrelated to the head of the
                                household as a separate household or include black families residing in white
                                households. (There were eight of the latter in the county.) It seeks rather to recreate
                                the family unit as it existed for blacks in 1880, seeing, for example, the addition of
                                an unrelated family or of a related family as a means of family adaptation. These
                                private families are classified according to the following types: nuclear (husband and
                                wife, or father, mother, and children); extended (a nuclear core and at least one
                                relative); and augmented (nuclear or extended and at least one boarder or lodger).
                                Finally, this study avoids the use of such words as patriarchal and matriarchal, since
                                the census offers little information on the quality of family life.</p>

            <p>Rootlessness was among the major potential handicaps to the creation of stable black families. The
                    county's black population had increased from slightly over 100 in 1860 to 2,130 in 1870.
                    During the 1870s the population nearly doubled. Such rapid growth was largely due to migration from
                    former slave states, particularly <placeName>

                    1880 had been born in states other than Indiana. Of them, 96 percent were natives of former slave
                    states. Of the Hoosier natives 80 percent were under age ten and the children of migrant parents.
                    Many newcomers, moreover, did not remain long in the county. Of the 465 heads of household in 1870,

                    percent were illiterate. Blacks were also desperately poor. In 1870 blacks owned less than 1 percent
                    of the total value of county real estate although they represented 6.4 percent of the population.
                    Only thirty blacks, slightly more than 1 percent of all blacks, owned real estate. A staggering
                    number, moreover, held the least desirable jobs. Of the 1,311 blacks listing a trade or occupation

                    opportunities for employment in such jobs as waiter, driver, or domestic. Only fifty-seven blacks
                    were professionals, proprietors, or skilled workers. Half of these were either teachers or

                    until coerced via the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in December, 1865. Such family and kin
                    sensibilities had their roots in African tradition and Afro-American adaptation, not merely in the

            <p>As shown in Table I, slightly over 83 percent of the black families in the county ten years later
                    contained a husband and a wife. In rural areas all but 2 percent did. In fact, in half of the rural
                    townships with blacks present, all families had a husband and a wife. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, two-parent families accounted for about 78 percent of the total. The smallest
                    proportion of two-parent families existed in Ward 2, but even there the figure was about 70 percent.
                    In Ward 1, which had the highest percentage of black residents (17) in the city, two-parent families
                    accounted for three quarters of the total. Most of the one-parent families—123 of 126 in
                    the city and four of five in the country—were female-headed. Put another way, 657 of the
                    county's black families had male heads. Given the late nineteenth-century equation of
                    male-headed families with family stability, <placeName>

                    </placeName> County is thus not easily explained as a legacy of slavery or of the shock of
                    migration. Nor can it be described as a result of economic condition alone. Earlier observers
                    attributed female-headed families to the absence of occupational stability and dignity among
                    lower-class black men, who as a result of their condition deserted their families and
                    "shifted the responsibility of the maintenance of the household unit to the women.

                    </placeName> County census of 1880 does not support this traditional view of a largely jobless and
                    irresponsible black male population. As shown in Table II, all but twenty-five male heads of
                    families, or slightly over 96 percent, listed a trade or occupation. The percentage of urban males
                    claiming a job was, moreover, greater than that of rural males. Of those listing a job, a
                    substantial majority stated that they had not been out of work for any portion of the previous year.</p>
            <p>A corollary of the traditional view held that there were many men whose wives worked as domestics,
                    with the result that the husband lost his moral authority because his wife was <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> County in 1880. Of the slightly more than four hundred black females listing a job in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, ninety were married, and of them, only eighteen, or one-fifth, had husbands who listed
                    no trade or occupation. That 80 percent of these families—about one in every seven black
                    families in the city—had two sources of income is an indication of adjustment to urban
                    conditions and strongly suggests that the traditional stereotype has limited utility. Moreover, few
                    married men lived separate from their spouses. Only twenty-four men—2 percent of the male
                    population aged twenty-one and above—fell into that category.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Economic status does, however, offer a clue to the structure of the black family. On the one hand, as
                    indicated in Table II, 356 male heads of families, or 79 percent of the total, were unskilled
                    laborers or service workers. Yet almost 96 percent of the employed black men in the city had such
                    employment. On the other hand, the proportion of professionals, proprietors, and skilled workers
                    heading families was slightly above 7 percent of the total of male-headed families, although the
                    percentage of all black males in these job classifications was slightly over 4 percent. The
                    likelihood of a man's heading a family appeared to decrease, in short, as job status
                        declined.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is also likely that female-headed families found life much harsher than those headed by males. For
                    the sixty-five female heads who had employment—all but one in service—the
                    level of income must have been very low. Hence families which depended on a woman's wages
                    were usually poor.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Among the fifty-eight other families with female heads, the
                    female had no employment, as noted in Table II, and the family depended for income upon a child, a
                    relative, or a boarder. As suggested by a recent study of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> black families, moreover, the black woman with children in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> probably faced enormous difficulties in remarrying, since suitably aged males suffered

                    their age and the physically taxing nature of the work available, males were more likely to leave
                    town to find work, and women without means and with children to support had little bargaining power
                    over a potential mate.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County appears, however, not to have affected family structure. As indicated in Table
                    III, there was a significant difference between the sex ratios in rural and urban portions of the
                    county. In the rural areas, the ratio was 175 males per 100 females, and in the age group in which
                    marriage was most likely, twenty-one to thirty, it was 193 to 100. This imbalance was due in large
                    part to the presence of 150 farm laborers aged fifteen to thirty. That these young men were probably
                    transient residents is suggested by the fact that the census was taken in June, a month in which
                    farm workers were in demand, and that most of the 150 men were single and residents of white
                    households. Such a condition might have been expected to encourage promiscuity, but there were
                    virtually no indications—desertion, divorce, or single parenthood—of such
                    occurrences. In the city, males and females were distributed equally in nearly every age bracket,
                    and thus there existed a potentially more favorable climate for stable family life. Two-parent
                    families represented, nonetheless, a far smaller proportion of all black families in the city as
                    compared with the country.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    32 percent. The fact that most female heads were in their twenties and thirties—unlike

            <p>Slavery, economic condition, sex ratio, and age, therefore, provide inadequate explanations for the
                    urban-rural differences in family structure. A more fruitful area of inquiry is the nature of the
                    urban experience itself. Rural and urban birthplace, when considered in conjunction with literacy,
                    suggests "compelling reason to question the destructive impact which slavery allegedly had
                    on the black family." Examination of birthplace and literacy in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County provides evidence consistent with recent studies which suggest that former
                    slaves were more likely than northern-born blacks to have two-parent households. Although it is
                    impossible to state un-equivocably that northern-born blacks had urban and southern-born blacks had
                    slave and rural roots, "place of birth provides a plausible proxy for ex-slave status,
                    especially when considered in conjunction with illiteracy."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> As

                    </placeName>'s southern-born blacks, literate as well as illiterate, surpassed their
                    northern-born counterparts in the percentage of two-parent families. Combined with the virtual
                    absence of one-parent families in the rural parts of the county, this strongly suggests that city
                    residence contributed to the breakdown of the two-parent family.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    <pb n="130" id="VAA4025-075-2-019"/> female heads of families worked as washwomen, cooks, domestics,
                    and chambermaids. An example was Rebekah Posey, a forty-seven-year-old widow who lived at 119
                    Chestnut Street and worked as a chambermaid on a steamboat. Her twenty-seven-year-old daughter
                    Maggie, who was single, also provided some income by working as a seamstress. The lack of such work
                    in rural areas may have attracted husbandless women with families to the city, thus lowering the
                    proportion of families with one parent in rural areas and raising it in the city.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This explanation needs some qualification, for about half of the females who headed families in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> were unemployed. All but ten of these women, however, had someone—a child, a
                    relative, or a boarder—to provide family income. Such was the case of the widowed Mary
                    Bailey of 223 Chestnut Street, whose family included a sixteen-year-old daughter, a sixty-year-old
                    mother, and two sons in their twenties, both of whom had jobs.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second aspect of city life contributing to the higher incidence of female heads in the city was the
                    social stress which accompanied the urbanization of newcomers. Of the 123 urban female heads, as
                    indicated in Table VI, thirty-four were single, married living without spouses, or divorced. That
                    was undoubtedly due in half of the cases to desertion or separation by husbands, either because the
                    husband left the family to seek employment elsewhere or because he lacked loyalty to his spouse. It
                    is interesting to note, moreover, that half of the married women living without spouses, half of the
                    unwed mothers, and one quarter of the divorced women resided in Ward 2, an area which may have
                    attracted these women because of its hotels, restaurants, steamboats, and affluent whites. The ward
                    also contained a third of the city's black boarders and a third of the single black males
                    over age eighteen. As such, the presence of single female parents in this ward may have reflected
                    the disintegration of social controls associated with rural society in what was probably the most
                    transient area of the city.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>Since the number of female heads of families who were single, married but living without their
                    spouses, or divorced accounted for slightly more than one-quarter of the total, however, a much more
                    persuasive explanation of female-headed families was widowhood. As revealed in Table VI, eight-nine,
                    or about 72 percent, of the female heads were widows. In the nineteenth century, mortality was
                    "the major link between female-headship and the poverty cycle. …" The
                    most ravaged among the poor were "the urban poor blacks, irregularly employed, segregated,
                    and neglected in matters of public health."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> The ferocity of mortality
                    among Indiana blacks was evident in many ways. In its report for 1882–1883, the Indiana
                    Board of Health disclosed that the death rate for Hoosier blacks was more than twice that of native
                    whites—16.5 per 1,000 population as compared with 7.3 per 1,000 population. In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, of the 507 coroners' inquests between 1888 and 1894, 153 cases, or slightly
                    over 30 percent, involved blacks, even though blacks accounted for less than a tenth of the total
                    population. In 1880, 23 percent of the persons buried in the city's largest public
                    cemetery, Oak Hill, were black. Death was, moreover, as commonplace among persons in their twenties
                    and thirties as it was among children and the elderly. In 1876, for example, of the sixty-eight
                    blacks buried at Oak Hill, twenty-six were aged two or less, seven were sixty or older, and
                    twenty-six were between twenty and forty years of age. Similarly, of the 153 blacks entered in the
                    coroners' inquests of 1888–1894, two of every five were between eighteen and
                    forty. It is also striking that sixteen of the twenty-six young adults buried in 1876 were males,
                    and that the coroners' inquests of 1888–1894 and 1898–1902 revealed a
                    similar pattern.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>The possibility that a husband might die at any moment was an omnipresent fact of family life for

            <p>City life, in short, appeared to alter somewhat the structure of the black family. The number of
                    female-headed families reflected the harshness of urban living conditions for blacks, including
                    their inability to compete on an equal basis with whites and the disintegration of the communal ties
                    associated with rural society.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Female-headed families also indicated that
                    urban life provided opportunities for employment of women which country life did not. Although it is
                    ultimately impossible to determine the exact relationship between city life and female-headed
                    families—i.e., how many married women were widowed, divorced, or deserted after arriving
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                    opportunities—it is clear that a close relationship existed and that the female-headed
                    family adapted to urban conditions. In seventy-one families headed by a woman, the household
                    included a relative or boarder, or both, as means of providing financial support and/or child care.
                    In two-thirds of the instances in which the female had a job, women worked as washwomen, a job which

                    the city's sixteen census districts, within walking distance of the city's hotels,
                    restaurants, steamboat landings, and homes of affluent whites, where a variety of opportunities for
                    domestic and personal service existed for black women as well as black men.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That three-quarters of the urban female heads were widows and not unwed mothers, divorced, or married
                    living without their spouses is one of many evidences of the importance of traditional family values
                    among blacks in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County. The two-parent, male-headed family appears to have been deeply rooted in the
                    culture of the migrant black and not an acquisition of life after emancipation. In spite of the
                    harsh effects of city life, which was probably the chief reason for the increase in the number of
                    female-headed families, an overwhelming number of urban black families contained a husband and a
                        wife.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Given that town life led to a greater proportion of female heads, it is also clear that the urban
                    family was required to adapt to different conditions by developing several distinctive forms. One of
                    the most important adaptations was taking in boarders. As shown in Table VII, in rural sections the
                    predominant family type was nuclear, the social unit which until recently most scholars had
                    considered an urban-industrial phenomenon. Of the 155 nuclear families, 123 included a father, a
                    mother, and at least one child. Of the rest, all but three were incipient—those in which
                    a husband and a wife had no children. All told, nuclear families accounted for about three-quarters

                            the black family, it is interesting to note that white families were not significantly
                            different in structure. In the census district with the highest percentage of native-born
                            whites, 83.9 percent of white families and 74.6 percent of black families were male-headed.
                            In the district with the highest percentage of foreign-born whites, the proportions were,
                            respectively, 86.6 and 83.0. In the district with the highest proportion of blacks, of the
                            134 black families, 59.0 percent were nuclear, 22.4 percent were extended, and 18.7 were
                            augmented. Of the 351 white families in that district, the corresponding percentages were
                            64.1, 17.4, and 18.5. On the whole, the chief difference between black and white families
                            appears to have been the occupational status of the family head, not the structure or
                            composition of the family. Few historians have attempted to compare systematically black and
                            white families. An exception is Harris, "Black <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                            </placeName>," but Gutman, in <hi rend="i">The Black Family</hi>,
                            303–326, states that such an endeavor is irrelevant, given the uniqueness of the
                            Afro-American experience.</item>

                    <pb n="135" id="VAA4025-075-2-024"/> of all rural black families. The extended family, often
                    presumed to be typical of rural society, represented only 12.4 percent of the total.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within the city, by contrast, families organized according to the nuclear type accounted for only
                    slightly more than half of the total, and less than half of the nuclear families—143 of
                    293—included father, mother, and children. About 30 percent of the nuclear families were
                    incipient, and approximately 20 percent were attenuated—those with one parent. Variations
                    of the extended family totalled slightly over 16 percent. The most significant difference among
                    urban families was the presence, in about one-third of them, of some form of family
                    augmentation—i.e., the addition of boarders and/or lodgers. Put another way, about the
                    same proportion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> families included relatives and/or boarders and lodgers as those which did not.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the typical rural family resembled that of James Wagner, who with his wife Henrietta had
                    recently moved from their native <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, since their youngest child, Viola, had been born in the Bluegrass state in 1878. A
                    farmer who perhaps rented his small amount of acreage, Wagner received help from his son, James,
                    Jr., who was listed as a farm laborer. The four middle children had attended school during the
                    previous year. Given the age of their eldest child, it is likely that James and Henrietta had been
                    married in the early 1860s at about the ages of twenty-five and twenty, respectively.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>Reasons for these urban-rural differences in family composition are probably more easily explained
                    than the differences in family authority. The economic condition of urban blacks seems especially
                    important. In general, as shown by Table VIII, the proportion of nuclear families increased with the
                    occupational status of the head of the family. Conversely, the proportion of families with boarders
                    increased as the occupational status of the family head declined, an indication of the need for
                    additional income. The addition of relatives to urban families <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="137" id="VAA4025-075-2-026"/> appears unrelated to job status. In rural areas, despite
                    occupation, the nuclear family was preponderant. Because of the extremely small number of rural
                    families in three of the five occupational categories, however, comparison is limited to
                    semi-skilled workers, mostly small farmers, and common laborers. Families of laborers were more
                    likely than those of semiskilled workers to be nuclear in form and less likely to include relatives.
                    The proportion of augmented families was nearly equal. The significant increase in family
                    augmentation and the decline of the nuclear family among urban lower class blacks, as compared with
                    the high incidence of nuclear families and the low incidence of augmented families among rural lower
                    class blacks, suggests that urban conditions, not the status of work, profoundly affected family
                    composition.</p>
            <p>Birthplace and sex of the head of the family appeared to have little effect upon family composition.
                    As noted in Table IX, among urban families there was little difference in the proportion of
                    augmented families with Indiana, other northern, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, or other southern roots. The chief difference seems to be the substantially higher
                    distribution of nuclear families in which the head was Indiana-born. Similarly, Indiana-born heads
                    of families seemed unlikely to add relatives. Perhaps Hoosier-born families were slightly poorer
                    than their southern-born counterparts, since relatives did not necessarily provide additional family
                    income and were a financial drain on family resources. Among rural families, the low number of
                    families with freeborn heads made comparison difficult. Among families with southern-born heads,
                    there was a much more substantial proportion of nuclear families and a much lower number of
                    augmented families than among their urban counterparts. Families of likely former slaves were
                    overwhelmingly nuclear in the country, but in the city they were evenly divided among nuclear and
                    extended or augmented types. As shown in Table X, moreover, the sex of the head of the family made
                    little difference. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, male and female-headed families were nearly alike in distribution by type. In
                    comparison with male-headed urban families, male-headed rural families were more likely to be
                    nuclear and less likely to be augmented. Since there were only four female-headed families in the
                    country, comparison of male and female-headed rural families is impossible.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>These comparisons suggest that city life was the chief reason for changes in the family composition
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County blacks. In response to the harshness of the urban climate, families found means
                    of adjusting and therefore of surviving. Although nineteenth-century observers identified boarding
                    with the lower class, and therefore poverty, squalor, and family disruption, they failed to discern
                    that family extension and augmentation were ways of preserving the family. For blacks to have
                    attempted to perpetuate the nuclear, isolated family in the city would have been self-destructive.
                    The inclusion of boarders provided families income and perhaps benefitted the boarder by giving
                    shelter, in a family environment, from urban stress. The addition of relatives could provide not
                    only additional family income but also such services as child care when both parents worked. It also
                    allowed for the perpetuation of a kin network in the urban setting, thus maintaining family ties and
                    affording shelter for relatives, many of whom were young. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the typical extended family was not three-generational but two-generational, including
                    a brother, sister, nephew, or niece of the head of the family or his spouse. As shown in Table VIII,
                    family extension was nearly as common among low status urban blacks as it was among the more
                    affluent. The addition of relatives, on the whole, was not a function of status—i.e., a
                    luxury which only some blacks could afford.</p>
            <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-075-2-029"/>
            <p>Such differences in family composition notwithstanding, an overwhelming majority of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County black families had at their core a husband, a wife, and at least one child.
                    Whether nuclear, extended, or augmented, in rural areas the core of 204 of 210 families was either
                    incipient or simple; in the city it was 448 of 574.</p>
            <p>A related effect of city life—the tendency for several unrelated families to live in the
                    same dwelling because of rental costs—was also evident. In 1880, although there were as
                    many families as there were dwellings in rural <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> the ratio was 1.2 families for each dwelling. More than one family resided in about 7
                    percent of rural dwellings, but in the city the percentage was 14.2. In most of these cases there
                    were two families per dwelling, but in thirteen cases there were three or more families per
                    dwelling. Rural families were, however, slightly larger than urban families—4.7 persons
                    per family as compared with 4.3, a likely reflection of the larger number of one-parent families in
                    the city.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another means by which the black family adapted to the city was through the employment of married
                    women. In this era, in which women were supposed to remain at home and avoid the vagaries of office
                    and factory, the importance of female employment among <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> blacks was clear. Of the approximately 1,700 blacks employed in the county in June,
                    1880, 430, or slightly more than 25 percent, were women, and all but eighteen of them lived in the
                    city. In rural areas, moreover, only five black wives worked, but in the city working wives
                    accounted for almost 23 percent of all employed black women, and for one-sixth of the married black
                    women. Such a pattern reflected the inferior economic position of the black <list type="footnotes">

                            family head was present in about one-quarter of the cases. Although augmentation seemed to
                            be a result of economic need, family extensions was not, as Pleck avers ("The

                            168–69), limited to those who could afford to take in relatives. See also U. S.,

            </p>
            <p>The urban black family also showed its adaptability in the frequency with which teenage children
                    worked away from the family. Although an overwhelming proportion of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County blacks resided in families—85 percent in rural areas and 91 percent
                    in the city—the typical black family in the city did not shelter children from the world
                    until legal age by either sending them to school or by keeping them out of the work force according
                    to the middle-class model.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> As disclosed by Table XI, of the forty-eight males
                    and forty-four females aged thirteen to twenty-one living at home in rural areas, twelve males and
                    only three females had a job. By contrast, thirty-six males and forty-one females either had no job
                    or had attended school the previous year. An additional seventy-five males and thirty-two females
                    did not live at home. That is, about 61 percent of the males and 42 percent of the females between
                    ages thirteen and twenty-one did not live with their families. If one adds the percentage of young
                    persons employed but living at home, about 67 percent of rural males and 47 percent of rural females
                    did not fit the late nineteenth-century model of the family as a shelter for its young members. In
                    the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the proportion of children in these categories was even greater—71.2
                    percent of males and 56.5 percent of females.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the probability that black schooling was inferior and that the poverty of black
                    families forced members to find work as soon as possible, it is likely that young, rural women were
                    more prone than young rural males to remain at home, and that when they left home, their purpose was
                    marriage. <list type="footnotes">

                            twenty-one. <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>

                    <pb n="142" id="VAA4025-075-2-031"/> If at home, rural males were far more likely to have a job than
                    rural females. They were also much less likely to marry, as seventy-one of the seventy-five males
                    living outside families were single. That females who wished to work moved to the city is suggested
                    by the substantial increase in the proportion of single females in the city who lived away from home
                    and had a job, as well as by the greater proportion of females than males in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There was also a substantial increase in the percentage of females who lived at home
                    and had a job, undoubtedly in domestic service. Another important urban-rural difference was the
                    near reversal of the proportion of males living at home and away from home, perhaps a reflection of
                    the availability of agricultural work when the census was taken. Like rural males, however, few
                    urban males in this age group either attended school or were married, and a larger
                    proportion—seventy-four of 197 in the city, as compared with twelve of 122 in the
                    country—had a trade or occupation. Urbanization, therefore, appeared to have altered the
                    life styles of females aged thirteen to twenty-one and to increase the percentage of working males
                    in that age bracket.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

            <p>The data provided in Table XI also offer a clue to the process by which blacks established families.
                    Here, too, there were evidences of the impact of urban life. In the thirteen to twenty-one age
                    bracket, twenty-four of seventy-six rural females and forty-three of 253 urban females, most of whom
                    were aged nineteen to twenty-one, were married, but only four of 123 rural and three of 197 urban
                    males were. That implied that although males and females began to leave home by their late teens,
                    females were much more likely to marry at that age than were males. This pattern was applicable to
                    rural as well as urban males and was also borne out by the presence of 165 single persons in the
                    country and 498 in the city aged eighteen or more, of whom 144 and 319, respectively, were men. It
                    also appears that when rural black females left home, they were more likely than their urban
                    counterparts to become married, if they remained in the country. Although one in three rural females
                    in this age bracket was married, only one in six urban females was.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                    families the male tended to be slightly older than his urban counterpart when marrying. Urban
                    females also tended to be closer in age to their mates. Furthermore, a study of two representative
                    sections—rural Pigeon Township and urban census district 77, which had the highest
                    percentage of black residents in the city—discloses that the average male head of family
                    in the rural area was 40.9 years and the age of his eldest child was 11.2, thus intimating that the
                    first child was born when the father was nearly thirty. In the city, the average male head was 38.1
                    years old and his eldest child 12.1, suggesting that initial fatherhood occurred at age twenty-six.
                    This also indicates that the typical head of the family in the county had been born in slavery in
                    the early 1840s and had begun his family shortly after the end of the Civil War. When and where
                    these families were formed can be determined in part by examining families with either at least two
                    children, the older born elsewhere and the younger born in Indiana, or with all children born
                    elsewhere. From these indicators one can infer that about 40 percent of the 210 rural and about 30
                    percent of the urban families had been created in a former slave state during the 1860s and had
                    migrated as a unit to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County between 1865 and 1880. That many families had southern roots and had migrated as
                    units was also evidenced by the ages of the persons listed in the census as Indiana-born. About 72
                    percent of the 360 rural and 63 percent of the 690 urban blacks who were native Hoosiers were aged
                    ten or less.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A substantial number of families, moreover, were in early stages of formation. As noted in Table XII,
                    about one-third of the heads of rural and urban families were aged twenty-one to thirty. An
                    additional third were in their thirties. All told, about 85 percent of urban and rural family heads
                    were aged fifty or less. That urban families were comparatively younger is indicated not only by the
                    slightly lower age of the average urban family head but also by the fact that a larger number of
                    urban families were incipient or childless—30 percent in the city as compared with 18.6
                    percent in the country. These families without children were usually headed by younger persons, for
                    about two in five rural heads of incipient families and three in five urban heads of incipient
                    families were aged thirty or less. <list type="footnotes">

                    hint that most incipient families were not headed by parents whose children had left home. Combined

                    average age of urban heads, the data suggest that not only were younger families more likely to

                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County soon after the Civil War. The couple-headed family was the core of black
                    society. Couples headed almost 98 percent of rural and 78 percent of urban families. Most blacks
                    lived in families, and most children lived with both parents. In family composition, about
                    three-fourths of rural and one-half of urban families were nuclear. Instances of divorce, desertion,
                    and other signs of marital stress were few. At the same time, however, there were important
                    differences between urban and rural families. Urban families had more one-parent heads, were more
                    likely to be extended or augmented, were slightly smaller in size but more likely to share a
                    dwelling with another family, slightly younger in the age of the head of the family, less likely to
                    have children, and more prone to break up due to death, divorce, and desertion. Adolescents in urban
                    families were less likely to attend school or to live with parents without having a job. The causes
                    of these differences cannot be attributed to slavery or the migration process, as blacks in the
                    county generally shared the same geographic roots and socioeconomic condition. The origins of these
                    differences lay instead in the urban experience, characterized by occupational instability,
                    residential segregation, disease, institutional racism, and social disintegration. The vitality of
                    the black family was nonetheless apparent in many ways, not only in the persistence of the
                    two-parent, nuclear family, but also in the various means by which the family adapted to the urban
                        setting.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>The activities of the first day of 1881 varied little from other days for William Gregory Harrison, a
                    young farmer from Jefferson Township, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana. He spent most of New Years Day in nearby Martinsville with his father,
                    brought several purchases home for his brother Alvin, chopped some firewood, and noted the
                    day's one distingushing event: "This day mother passed the fiftieth milestone on
                    her life's journey."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> William Gregory was twenty-six years old
                    at the time he penned the above comment, and he still resided on his father's, Frederick
                    Augustus Harrison's, farm. The journal that the young man kept during 1880 and 1881
                    presents a detailed look at mid-nineteenth-century farm life. He was a bright, perceptive observer,
                    and his journal thus remains an important documentary source for daily life in rural Indiana.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Publication here of the second part of the Harrison journal provides an opportunity to add additional
                    information and some clarification to that originally presented in Part I, published in the
                    December, 1978, <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> As noted in Part I, William Gregory

                    </placeName> and Alvin Daniel, had all died at the age of twenty-seven at approximately two year
                    intervals. It, however, had proved impossible to locate causes of death for each of the young men.

                    </placeName> in the mortality schedules also proved enlightening. Based upon the birth places and
                    dates of the two youngest Harrison children—both of whom had died in
                    childhood—it had been presumed that the Frederick A. Harrisons had moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
                    </placeName> sometime between 1857 and 1863. The notation in the mortality schedules that Charles
                    had resided in the county for nineteen years indicated that the move from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    sermons, but referred, instead, to girls. The lines supported the original contention that

                    mundane farm chores—plowing and harrowing the fields and washing clothes. Yet, as often

                                    to-day (he began it yesterday) and about two o clock took it home. It was a cloudy,

                                    much freezing merely I guess because everything is frozen that can be. The day was
                                    sacred to hauling logs. There is snow to an average deepness of five inches at

                                    dull, and the snow rather cool for the feet. I cut a considerable hole in one of my

                                    make a road to the cow-barn and the inside of said cowbarn had also to be dealt

                                    was only where the sun had the advantage. Father spent the forenoon on the other
                                    side of the creek where Foster and Hand were manufacturing wood. Bill Bunton came
                                    again in quest of hog's heads and about eleven o clock I accompanied him to
                                    where Father was. Tom Newbern<hi rend="sup">54</hi> came while I was there which

                                    the 11th day of last December. After considerable puttering we got down three large

                                    than yesterday. Father departed early to Martinsville on Stoke's

                                    did'n't get home again till four o'clock. Alvin was in

                                    shortly after I got there. He is quick in gesture and a little sensational in style
                                    with enough of the stump speaker about him to hold the attention of his audience.
                                    The seats were all filled, and the congregation orderly. His sermon though somewhat
                                    scattering was able and telling. His magnetic power was exemplified in the
                                    collection for he drew between 25 or 30 dollars out of the pockets of the audience
                                    and kept it in a laughing humor by his wit and liveliness. I spent the time till
                                    night with Doc. Curtis. King. York<hi rend="sup">58</hi> was there and Bill

                                    old subject the Prodigal Son. I had heard Elder Woods handle the same subject in a
                                    powerful sermon and did'n't expect to be much edified by Mr.
                                    Poucher He however struck out on a different course, by running a parallel between
                                    the lives of the young men of to-day and the life of the Prodigal Son. The vivid and
                                    circumstantial manner in which the disgrace and struggles of the young man were
                                    portrayed kept the congregation almost spell-bound. Three mourners came forward in
                                    response to his fervid invitation and till after nine o'clock he worked in
                                    conjunction with the brethren for the souls of those boys but without avail. The
                                    protracted meeting came to a close and about eleven o'clock I was in bed at
                                    home. The day was cloudy. It thawed some little but was chilly and overcoats felt
                                    good. Alvin took a jook over the creek during the day and brought home a
                                    hornet's nest. Nobody of the rest went anywhere or did anything noteworthy.</p>

                                    disappeared at night, nor had it thawed much. The creek was bank full and roared
                                    rather viciously. The business of the day was sitting in the house. Mother did

                        <p>The rain was still coming down this morning and kept at it but not constantly, all
                                    day. The creek dammed up with the ice which had drifted down against a pile of
                                    driftwood just below our line, was roaring and running over its banks all day. The
                                    fog rolled up and sailed northward. The ground has thawed but little. I took three
                                    distinct "jooks" two down to the creek to see what was happening,
                                    one in the forenoon and one just at night. The other one was taken about four
                                    o'clock. I followed up a sound of chopping which I thought indicated
                                    somebody near and found nobody except Will Bain who was just about leaving his
                                    school-house when I arrived at it. Bob Foster was here a little while this morning
                                    to get some linseed oil. Alvin accompanied him part of his way home and soon after

                                    noon in search of work, he said, but we could'n't supply him.
                                    Father and I hauled up four shocks of fodder on the sled about noon but it was so
                                    nasty that we were glad to quit. Bob and Bill went to work on the wood contract
                                    after noon and kept at it till night. The robins are here in great droves</p>

                        <p>The rain was still falling pitilessly this morning when we arose, and had apparently
                                    been at it all night. It rained in pelting showers with intervals of quitting all
                                    day. Clear spots in the sky were occasionally seen but it was raining in hard
                                    showers at night. The creek raised till it broke the road fence in three long gaps,
                                    strewed saw-logs, rails, ice, chunks etc. over John Fowler's wheat, and
                                    finally carried the greater part of the drifted ice down stream with a good deal of
                                    noise. It was falling at last accounts. Our doings were limited to the chores and an
                                    occasional excursion down to watch the progress of the overflowing scourge. I
                                    noticed part at least of Will's school down there during the noon
                                    intermission, and also saw Bob Foster making a tour of observation along the banks.

                        <p>At about 9 o'clock last night the rain quit. It snowed a slight squall this
                                    morning then ceased and remained cloudy and rather sour till night. Nothing of much
                                    importance was done. Father wandered about down at the creek veiwing the desolation.
                                    The road fence is broken in five places and most of the rails gone; John
                                    Fowler's wheat is smeared over with sand and slush in many places, logs,
                                    rails chunks and cakes of ice are scattered over it in great profusion; the road is
                                    in some places hollowed out, in places filled up with sand, and in still other
                                    places blocked with ice. Father made enough fence to keep the cows out of the wheat
                                    and the road, and spent some time over in the woods with Bob Foster who was waiting
                                    for Bill Hand to come. Bill I believe did'n't come. Alvin was in
                                    the shop except a little time while he was helping me at the wood-pile. The world
                                    looks positively filthy to me in its mud and water.</p>

                                    could'n't get across. I trudged up to Foster's, saw Bill
                                    Hand and him heading for the woods across the creek followed them over there and
                                    helped them for three hours or more than came home. Alvin squizzed most of the time,
                                    took I believe one "jook" to the creek.</p>

                        <p>The howling winds were abroad all last night. It blew in great gusts from the south
                                    from about eight o'clock last night till sundown to-day. A violent snow
                                    storm was also going on most of the time especially after daylight and the snow was
                                    whirled in blinding clouds. Spots of ground were sometimes left bare, or almost so,
                                    and others were covered deep with the drifted snow. It was blown through the
                                    smallest cracks and was an inch deep in the wood-house and shop. The snow ceased at
                                    sundown, the wind still blew, though not so hard. As may be imagined little was done

                        <p>It was clear this morning and the mercury stood at zero. Thin clouds were around at
                                    night. Father went to town afoot with the basket of butter. He was gone most of the
                                    day of course. I passed the greater part of the day in cutting down and trimming up
                                    a beech tree just east of the mouth of the lane or at the corner of Bill
                                    Hand's wheatfield. Alvin and Mother cleansed the clothes of the household
                                    once more. After they were done Alvin and I hauled up a sled load of fodder and also
                                    a sled load of limbs of the tree which I cut. Wat came this evening and got Hemp the
                                    hog. The O'Neals went into the clover patch corn to-day and began gathering

                        <p>And they were at it to-day also. The day was not very cold but not very much thawing
                                    was done. Enough was done though to make it disagreeable hauling. Alvin and I hauled
                                    the remainder of the limbs cut yesterday (one sled-load) then hitched to the
                                    log-sled and hauled the two logs the body of the tree made. The first or biggest log
                                    came near "stalling" the team, the second one was no trouble.
                                    After that we went down to the creek close to Fowler's line and brought a
                                    dry log or water-gate pole that the creek had washed there. Father was gone from 10
                                    o'clock till two about the vicinity of Fowler's and old Stokely

                                    stopped here awhile and when he went on I went with him. I was at Fowler's
                                    awhile and at noon went on over to Effie's school to be present at
                                    "Commencement" as this was the last day. A dozen or fifteen
                                    visitors in all, I guess, came during the course of the afternoon. There were three
                                    lessons recited, the rest of the time being given to declamations readings, closing

                                    which was succeeded by an exhortation wrenched from the quivering lungs of Hemp
                                    Lewis and delivered at the top of his powerful voice. The preacher was twice moved
                                    to hint very plainly about order. I got home at nine o'clock. Father went
                                    down to the creek this morning, got in and got his feet wet. The O'Neals
                                    were still gathering corn in the clover patch to-day. Father afterwards went down to
                                    the creek road and broke the ice that was in it. The day was nearly clear and not
                                    uncomfortably cool.</p>

                        <p>A day set apart for hauling. We went down to the creek and after helping haul out a
                                    wagon that was stuck in the creek (the ford is full of quicksand now) we gathered,
                                    and hauled up a sled-load of drift-wood to the house then went down into the pasture
                                    and hauled up two more loads of "picked up" wood a rather
                                    rubbishing lot. Next we hauled up a load of fodder. After dinner Father took the
                                    scalding-barrel borrowed a week ago Friday, home again after which he and I hauled
                                    up two more loads of fodder. It had been cloudy and chilly all day and about four
                                    o'clock it went to pelting down snow and sleet. This storm however did not

                        <p>It rained at least a good part of last night and for an hour or so this morning. It

                                    night. Nothing of much moment was attempted. I whacked at the wood-pile frequently.
                                    Father chored around and made frequent pedestrian trips to the creek. One stranger

                        <p>Bill Hand came soon this morning and got 2 sacks of corn in the ear or rather had
                                    them taken to town. Father Bill and I bumped over the frozen roads to town in the
                                    big wagon. I did nothing noticeable except forget my overcoat and leave it in town.
                                    I got the last payment or final one rather on the Mrs. Garrison and Ira Moore<hi rend="sup">62</hi> notes amounting to $37, of Riley Nosier.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Father got himself a cast maul and I brought another pair of
                                    breeches out but I guess with the same result as on Feb. 5th. A letter from
                                    Grandmother was received. She appears to have had the rheumatism and talks rather
                                    doubtfully about coming out here but still hopefully. We had a load of passengers
                                    coming home and it was nearly five o'clock before we got there. There was a
                                    slight coat of snow on the ground but the sky soon cleared. It then became nice
                                    overhead and nasty underfoot, and warm enough to be comfortable. The calf John was

                        <p>That mingled snow and rain was in very small quantity. It froze last night and thawed
                                    to day, one in about equal extent with the other. The sun shone brightly all day and
                                    there were very few clouds. Hauling wood was the principal business of the day. The

                                    hauled one load before noon. After dinner he took the Ira Moore note and some money,

                                    night. I was assisted somewhat by Alvin who spent the intervals between loads where
                                    Foster and Hand were at work on the wood contract. One of O Neal's cows was

                                    washed. The day was generally cloudy, the ground thawed but little and the air was

                        <p>Father departed to town a-horseback to attend court. Alvin attempted to split up a
                                    rail cut left of a stave-tree cut on the point west of the house and did split the
                                    most of it into rails. I worked at stowing wood away in the woodhouse and also
                                    splitting some. At noon Father returned (the case had been put off,) and soon went
                                    down and put up the rest of the rails I hauled <list type="footnotes">

                                    destroyed the lane back of the orchard and had about a hundred or so rails to haul
                                    down to the road, I only got one sled load hauled however. Sayroy Kivett<hi rend="sup">67</hi> and Morgan Secrest were here hunting Father this afternoon

                        <p>Father went down and laid up the rails hauled yesterday. I fussed around till he came
                                    back, which last happened about ten o'clock He and I then got ready and
                                    went to town in the hack. I spent most of the time at Uncle Rip's house as
                                    I did not feel very well. We started back home about two o'clock. It had
                                    looked rather threatening all the morning and sprinkled smartly several times during
                                    the afternoon. It was a warmer day than we have had since last October we think.
                                    Alvin spent all the time we were gone with Foster and Hand. They did not work at the
                                    wood yesterday. Bob Foster's boys brought home about 20 pounds of fresh

                                    John Kivett was also there. I came back saddled up old Colonel and took a ride for

                        <p>It rained and sleeted a little last night but the sun shone through thin clouds all
                                    of to-day; and there was some more thaw than yesterday. John Fowler and I were
                                    thinking of opening the sugar camp on the upper eighty in partnership to-day. He was
                                    over before breakfast this morning and after consultation we agreed not to do
                                    anything to-day. After breakfast Father and I "rung" the noses of
                                    the nine pigs<hi rend="sup">69</hi> and otherwise attended to them. Then we hauled
                                    two sled-loads or eight shock of fodder up. After dinner he went down and chopped
                                    awhile in Bain's drift while I hauled a sled-load of rails from here to the
                                    creek, picked up a few drifted ones and hauled them into more convenient position
                                    then came back up on the hill made things right or partly so, up there, then
                                    unhitched, and went over across the creek to where Foster and Hand were at work and
                                    had been since morning. Father was there twice during the course of the afternoon to
                                    borrow and return an ax. The old beehive was opened to-day, quite a lot of honey
                                    both good and bad, both capped and uncapped was found in it but every bee was dead.

                        <p>There was a thunder-storm up north for a part of the night and this morning there
                                    began a series of snow squalls accompanied by wind which lasted all day with but
                                    small intermissions. The sun looked forth once or twice for very brief periods.
                                    Nothing could be done or was done besides the chores. Father I believe made one trip
                                    to the big-road and back and I began a letter to Mr. John Harmon one of

                                    o'clock I rigged up and went over to Fowler's to attend
                                    John's "Infair" as per invitation received from John
                                    himself last Tuesday. About 18 were present besides the family I believe. Except
                                    that I made a couple of stupid blunders I believe everything went off smoothly and
                                    everybody enjoyed themselves. I was back home by five o'clock. Father spent

                        <p>The snow-squalls continued with as much severity as before, but were fewer and
                                    farther between. There is about two inches of snow on the top of the mud as a result
                                    of this storm. As Bob was going with the hack to town to-day Father took the butter
                                    and went afoot to the road to wait for him. After waiting awhile he concluded Robert
                                    had gone. He came back and had got a horse out of the stable, when he espied Bob in
                                    the dim distance and hoofed it back to the road again. He got back home about five
                                    o'clock. I fussed around at various things of small importance. Had a

                                    Fowler's with the wagon by hitching his horse and Hemp to it, got a load of
                                    dry wood, an old boiling- pan, 16 more buckets and came back. John was obliged to go
                                    to Jack Hinson's and went afoot across the hills. He got back about
                                    supper-time, ate here, gassed awhile and went on home. It was a sunshiny partly
                                    cloudy day, thawed gradually and the sap ran gloriously. I was not feeling very well

                                    Foster's and got a lot of plank with which when they got back we made a
                                    shed. They then hauled up some wood by which time it was noon. After dinner I
                                    did'n't go up till four o'clock and then
                                    did'n't stay long. Father and John got in the rest of the sap. The
                                    total amount of sap is I believe about four barrels and a half, so far. John went
                                    back home about four o'clock, and Pap went and filled up after supper.

                        <p>We hauled in two barrels of sap to-day and carried about a half barrel. We
                                    "stirred off' twice, once this forenoon and once about eight
                                    o'clock at night, getting between four and five gallons of pretty thick
                                    syrup each time of which John got one-third. We hauled up a lot of wood and made
                                    some of an ash log that was handy. We had four visitors during the day
                                    John's father-in-law Mr. J. J. Hinson, John's wife Dora and her
                                    sister Bell and lastly Miss Tenie Fowler. Mr Hinson came in the forenoon, the rest
                                    in the afternoon. Father "over-saw" us most of the time though he
                                    was gone for a couple of hours after dinner to where Foster was at work with his two

                                    neuralgia. Alvin was also with us a good part of the time. The day was cloudy and
                                    reasonably warm. I felt no better owing to an hurting in my breast</p>

                        <p>It cleared off about noon or nearly cleared. We got in about two barrels of sap this
                                    morning and two this afternoon, tapped more trees till we used up the Fowler buckets
                                    and some few good troughs and stirred off again at about eight o'clock at
                                    night. At noon Bill Hand again giving out John was hired to help Foster but Foster
                                    not knowing of it came down to the boiling place a-visiting with John Kivett. They
                                    did'n't stay long however. Oily Hinson<hi rend="sup">71</hi> also
                                    came and sojourned in the neighborhood till after we "stirred
                                    off." Father and I put in the time from noon till well towards night
                                    hauling fodder getting 17 shocks into the barn. John came around as we got the last
                                    in, and he and I helped by Oily gathered in our afternoon sap. Foster visited us
                                    again for a few moments and took Oily off with him to supper while John came here
                                    for his. Foster, his two boys and Oily were present when we "stirred
                                    off." Wat Harrison came this afternoon and got a sow, one of the two
                                    younger ones, which he had bargained for long ago. We had about five gallons of good

                        <p>It froze a little last night but grew cloudier and chillier all day spitting a little
                                    snow or rain once in a while. We went to work hauled rails from Bain's

                                    barrels of sap, and Father and John spent the afternoon in boiling it down. They got
                                    a little more syrup than they had at any one time before; between five and six
                                    gallons. Only one visitor was present at the "stir-off,"
                                    John's brother Walter. It was nearly dark when Father got home. Alvin was

                                    Father and I went to town in the hack. The roads are fearfully

                                    molasses, and got a big jug of hers to put more in. Father also bought some jugs for
                                    our own use. John Foster was down this morning to send after his Father's
                                    mail; John Kivett was here in the afternoon to get a can or two of fruit, and Bill
                                    Hand came towards night to get some meal. We had taken some two sacksfull of corn
                                    from our crib to be ground for him. Celeste Johnson and Sallie Rodgers<hi rend="sup">72</hi> rode over with us as we came back. There was meeting on the creek at

                                    in the morning and insisted on the necessity of baptism to salvation. In the evening

                                    Alvin was not there having to help wash. Foster and Hand put in the time cutting

                                    to-night. The day began clear and bright, and closed with a sky that threatened
                                    rain. Alvin has been for several days cutting up some beech trees just above the
                                    "orchard" the idea being to make a potato patch up there. I helped
                                    him saw up the body of one of the trees this forenoon. Father spent the forenoon
                                    helping Foster and Hand again. After dinner he and I plowed and scraped up a small
                                    levee near the junction of the Ballingertown branch and the big creek. It was pretty
                                    hard on both horses and men. We picked up a wagon load composed of driftwood and
                                    fencerails near our line. Alvin worked away at his potato patch most of the

                        <p>It rained in showers all of last night and up to nearly ten o'clock today
                                    when the wind began to blow hard from the south and west. It grew colder and
                                    occasional small spurts of snow flakes fell. Bill Hand came shortly after breakfast
                                    and about ten o'clock Father and he started in the hack to town. Nothing
                                    was done here as it was too bad and threatening weather to be out doors. Father got

                        <p>I suffered with pain in the face so last night that I did not go upstairs to bed till
                                    after twelve o'clock but I slept soundly from that time till morning. The

                                    dribbled down all day but thawed off faster than it came Nobody got very far from

                                    about three barrels of sap. Two visitors shed the light of their countenances upon

                                    were all there. The visitors were; Billy Ballinger in the afternoon and Oliver
                                    Hinson and Thomas Devere at night. Alvin was gyrating around at various places
                                    during the day. A gay time was had in the sugar camp at night. John Foster and Say
                                    Kivett were there besides those already mentioned. Two of them went to

                        <p>Wat came early in the day to see if he could have the use of the sugar camp. He had
                                    got John's consent and Pap's was easily obtained I was not asked.
                                    I took three yaller powders and was rendered incapable of duty. Father spent the
                                    forenoon helping Foster and Hand, (who also, I have omitted to mention were at work
                                    yesterday.) Alvin fumed around in search of something to do that suited him. After
                                    dinner he and Father cut down one oak tree that stood close to the boiling place.
                                    Wat put in his appearance in the shank of the afternoon gathered sap and went to

                                    but not very cool all day. In the afternoon there was a very good run of sap.</p>

                                    just before Pap left. It froze hard last night, and was only partially cloudy with a
                                    south wind. Wat had the best run of the season, getting six barrels of sap. Some of

                                    supper. Wat stirred off in the afternoon and got four or five gallons of syrup.
                                    There was a good deal of rattling noise over the creek to-day for John Kivett and

                        <p>It did not freeze last night. To-day was cloudy and threatening with little spurts of
                                    hail, rain, snow, and sleet, <hi rend="i">very</hi> little most of them were. I
                                    spent two hours in the sugar-camp with Wat, the rest of the time in the house or
                                    doing little chores around it. Father was occupied during most of the forenoon in
                                    hauling in the last of the fodder, (twenty-two shocks). Alvin helped him. After
                                    dinner Father divided his time about equally between the sugar-camp, and Foster and
                                    Hand. Alvin has been occupied part of these two days in fixing the kitchen windows
                                    in rolling order. Fanny Sloan was here with a girl unknown to us, to beg for
                                    soap-grease but she got none. Wat stirred off before night and quit. I had another

                        <p>Albert Bishop came early and borrowed the brace and bit to freshen the trees with.
                                    There was a slight coating of snow on the ground this morning but the sky was clear
                                    and the bare spots at least were frozen hard. A cold wind blew, sometimes hard from
                                    a northerly direction but still thawing went on, except in the shade, through the
                                    day. Father went to town in the hack pretty early and stayed till about 5
                                    o'clock; I mean it was that time when he got home. Alvin fussed around; got
                                    wood etc. I did what I have been doing all the week. My jaw opens half an inch yet.
                                    There is no pain as a general thing, no swelling either visible or feelible that can

                                    here just at night after some meal. Father took two bushels of corn to mill for him

                                    Hand all partook and had plenty. I went up there early to pass away the time, Father
                                    went later. Alvin spent the greater part of the day making the hinge-post for a
                                    gate. After dinner Father went up and finished making his fence lumber. Jap Foster
                                    was sent down to borrow the hogringers and get me to fetch the old dog up there. He
                                    was already there but I took him to the side of a hill at some distance from the
                                    boiling place, where Sayroy Kivett and three other fellows were with rifles. At
                                    about two rods distance Sayroy put a rifle bullet through the old dog's
                                    head almost exactly in the center of his forehead. He never knew what hurt him but
                                    throwing all four feet together, turned a somersault and expired. Foster was to have
                                    all the sap after Kivett's stirring off. He got nearly four barrels and
                                    when he hauled them in brought in the buckets also and piled them near the boiling
                                    place. The visitor besides myself and Kivett was Dan Bain. Foster stirred off at
                                    night and had nearly the same crowd I guess.</p>

                        <p>Bose was born in the summer of 1871 at the residence of V. T. (commonly called Jake)
                                    Harrison. He has been with this family since September of that year. His virtues
                                    were rather negative than positive. He had but little training, and therefore was of
                                    little use comparatively speaking, but he did as little harm as any dog that ever
                                    lived his number of years as he had almost no bad habits whatever</p>

                        <p>To-day was cloudy and chilly but considerably warmer than for a few days back. Alvin
                                    went up to the sugar camp immediately after breakfast and heating some water
                                    proceeded to scald out the buckets and other things I staid around home helping Pap
                                    get started etc. He went about nine o clock in the hack and I went up and helped
                                    Alvin. We finished before noon, then went up and buried our old dog near where he
                                    fell. After noon we made poplar stovewood and put it in the <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-075-2-082"/> woodhouse till night. Father got home about five
                                    o'clock John Bain came with him and drove home a sow of his that has been
                                    staying here for some time past. John Foster for some reason came after hog rings
                                    about six o'clock.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Sunday, April 10th.</p>
                        <p>It was a day of sunshine and about 60 degrees of warmth, with threatening clouds
                                    Nobody but Alvin went far off the place this forenoon: he took a jook somewhere in
                                    the direction of Fowler's. After dinner I went up to Crone's
                                    a-horseback. A tolerable sized crowd listened with patience to sermon from Mr. Moore
                                    of which being a late arrival I did not hear the text, and could only guess at the
                                    subject. I went down to Wat's and Bain's awhile before coming
                                    home.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Monday April 1111th.</p>
                        <p>A day of puttering around. It threatened rain all the forenoon and did rain in
                                    occasional showers during the afternoon. Father spent the time till ten
                                    o'clock where Foster and Hand were at work at the wood. Alvin and I hauled
                                    in the buckets and other utensils from the sugar camp leaving Fowler's
                                    buckets up there. I then went again and got the log-sled Father came back and cut a
                                    gate post from the top of the oak tree which he has been working up into fence
                                    "lumber." I went down with the wagon to where we piled a few rails
                                    March 18th. and hauling them down, rebuilt with them that end of the levee fence
                                    which we took to build part of the road fence. After this I went up and got the gate
                                    post. The rain after dinner hindered work. Father and Alvin made a gate or rather
                                    put one together, Mother and Alvin performed the usual cleansing of dirty duds for
                                    the week.</p>

                        <p>Foster and Hand finished the schoolhouse contract of wood yesterday and to-day
                                    entered upon a contract to cut 6 cords for W. W. Kennedy There was a thunder-storm
                                    and a hard rain last night. The creek was bank full the morning, and Father
                                    did'n't get over to where they were at work till nearly night when
                                    he rode over. He tried to this morning and couldn't. Alvin and I spent most
                                    of the forenoone sawing up the trees he cut, up above the orchard for the new
                                    "tater patch. Bill Dezearn was here a little while about noon and I was
                                    with <hi rend="i">him a</hi> short time where he was grubbing. Father and Alvin this
                                    afternoon hung their new gate between the ice-house and the cow-barn <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-075-2-083"/> and put a panel of plank fence there besides. Our horse
                                    Dave or Hemp being loose in the yard before the house broke the dashboard off the
                                    hack which was standing there and demolished one of the forewheels by getting fast
                                    in it some way. The hay is all out of the horse stable and there is about one
                                    day's feed of fodder left. Cloudy all day with a little rain just at night</p>

                        <p>To-day the sky was clouded and no sun was seen. There was a slight snow storm in the
                                    evening and the air was rather raw and chilly. Alvin painted the sap buckets, which
                                    had been put in the shop last Monday. He painted them red on the outside. Father and
                                    I hauled manure from around the stable door and in the stalls. That from in the
                                    stable we made a hot-bed of in the usual place in the corner of the garden: the rest
                                    we hauled on the field immediately below the garden. It was very slushy nasty work.
                                    It was hauled on the sled and hoed off it. Foster and Hand entirely finished up the
                                    wood this forenoon and Bill came and settled with Pap about two o'clock.
                                    There are $3.50 due him I had a slight gas with Wat who passed through
                                    about night going home. To-day was my 26th. birthday.</p>

                        <p>There was a pretty hard freeze last night. The sun shone in mostly a clear sky to-day
                                    but clouds denoting rain soon, came up in the evening. Father and Alvin sawed a cut
                                    off an oak log down in the pasture and Father split it into fence-posts. Alvin
                                    hauled wood down to the wood-pile through the "orchard" from his
                                    prospective "‘tater patch" on the sled I helping him We
                                    quit that at ten o'clock; hitched to the wagon, put 17 baskets full of corn
                                    in it and went to Jake's, by the way of Dan Kirk's. We had no
                                    accidents and got home again before one o'clock but it was very hard on the
                                    horse. After dinner Father disappeared till nearly five o'clock. Alvin and
                                    I finished hauling wood, rails, etc. from the prospective
                                    "tater-patch" and Alvin spent the time till night in an only
                                    partly successful attempt to burn a pile of green brush. Father and I took the sled
                                    and scraper; went down to the big road gate and scraped sand into a hole that the
                                    creek had washed under the gate. Mr Leander Lewis was here to see Pap about
                                    something about three o'clock but of course did not find him. Bob Foster
                                    came this afternoon and got the old musket and accoutrements to go duck-hunting with
                                    on the morrow.</p>

                        <p>To-day was cloudy with raw northwest wind and fine drizzling rain in the middle of
                                    the day for two or three hours. Father was gone all day to town, to attend a meeting
                                    of the Township Assessors in the Auditor's office I presume. Alvin was gone
                                    all day with the cross-cut saw. He was helping Jake in a small clearing, which our
                                    worthy uncle has under way. I put in my time in finishing up the clearing, burning,
                                    etc. which Alvin began yesterday. Thanks to the high wind I was successful. John
                                    Kivett was here in the forenoon and put a handle on his pitch-fork. He also took
                                    away the "tater-digger." The absent members of the family returned
                                    about five o'clock. The grass is beginning to show a slight greenness and
                                    the buds on the trees are a little bit larger. But Spring seems to be stalled
                                    somewhere with a heavy load of winter weather. Father was up at Foster's
                                    awhile after supper.</p>

                                    however a perceptible rawness of air. Father and I spent most of the day in town. We
                                    went in the big wagon and took the skeleton of the old hack and the rims of the
                                    wheels having knocked the spokes out. We had six in the wagon in all when we came
                                    out of town, six passengers I mean including us. Alvin tinkered around at various
                                    chores. Bill Hand came and got his last meal on the wood contract; this evening</p>

                                    After dinner I harrowed it and furrowed it out. Father came home before I had
                                    finished furrowing and covered most of the potatoes, which Alvin dropped. Mother and
                                    Alvin as usual cleansed the more or less dirty habiliments etc. of the household.

                        <p>It did'n't rain. But yesterday's and to-day's
                                    weather were as much alike as two peas, except that it was clearer. We had plenty of
                                    callers. First came Jap Foster and borrowed the iron wedge. Father departed on the
                                    black hoss for the "Bottoms" but met Mr. Isenhower<hi rend="sup">86</hi> coming to him. They came here, staid till after dinner and went away
                                    again, Pap afoot. Alvin and I went up and enlarged the potato patch in the calf and
                                    hog pasture by moving out a big tree top which had to be sawed up and a big pile of
                                    logs and limbs big and little, made of it. After clearing it, I plowed harrowed and
                                    furrowed it. The plowing was not as hard work as on yesterday's patch and
                                    it harrowed up nicely. We had to haul rails and fence our enlargment which did not
                                    leave us time to plant. John Kivett came towards night and got some of his fruit
                                    cans Shortly afterwards came Aleck Benge, and one of Meter Benge's boys;

                                    year ago to-day.) We then hitched to the sled and hauled manure. First we cleaned
                                    out the buggy-shed, and that done we hauled away the cow-manure. The stuff was half
                                    liquid and mixed with corn-stalks, which made it a bothersome and nasty job. Part of

                                    o'clock it sprinkled occasionally. The rain kept steadily coming down from
                                    four till night but not in very great quantity. Jap and John Foster brought home the

                                    we were down there we got a load of gravel from the creek and put in the buggy-shed.
                                    Two loads of manure and two of gravel were hauled before the rain compelled us to

                                    o'clock. He brought a load of sawdust to put in the ice-house, and among

                                    garden and assisted me some little. Aleck Benge was here about five o'clock

                                    too late to take any part. I also took a jook up to Foster's and
                                    Kivett's but came home again before dark. Father took a journey to

                                    was'n't at home. "The rest of us" did as I

                        <p>It was showery in the morning and in the evening and rained considerably here both
                                    times. It quit before eight o'clock this morning and Father meandered off
                                    on the assessing business again. W. Riley Nosier came and bought 9 pounds of clover
                                    seed for 90 cents and borrowed an inch chisel. I went a-horseback down to
                                    Bain's; took them a couple of messes of Peach Blow potatoes as a present
                                    and got some yeast. After dinner I went to plowing the buckwheat ground for oats. It
                                    was very hot. Father got home about five o'clock and sowed part of his oats
                                    (bought in town last Saturday) on the ground already <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-075-2-088"/> plowed. We were both driven in by a shower and quit for

                        <p>It was cloudy more or less all day and it lacked a <hi rend="i">little</hi> of being
                                    as hot as it was yesterday. I finished plowing the land I began yesterday, and
                                    Father sowed the remainder of his oats which did not sow much more than half of the
                                    ground plowed. Father then departed on the assessing journey again, while I went
                                    a-horseback out to Mr. Obadiah Ratts's<hi rend="sup">88</hi> to deliver a

                                    them. Afterward Alvin and I hauled two wagon-loads of the wood Bill Bunton made last
                                    fall across the creek, and put it in the wood house. I then went to harrowing in the

                        <p>Another cool day with considerable clouds. Father and I started to town about nine o
                                    clock in the wagon taking eggs, butter, five sacksfull of corn, some (all of the)
                                    harrow teeth, and Tenie Dezearn's basket of butter besides. I made no
                                    purchases and got nothing except that I got tired. Father bought things too numerous
                                    to mention individually here. We got home some little after five o'clock.
                                    While we were gone Alvin and Mother took almost every article of furniture out of
                                    the fireplace room and went to scraping off the whitewash They
                                    did'n't get nearly done and apparently will not for a week. After
                                    we came home Father and Alvin burnt the harrow teeth into the new wood-work. The new
                                    harrow is to be a foot longer than the old one</p>

                        <p>It began raining at about seven o'clock in showers and kept at it till
                                    towards night and still continued threatening. No one of us got far from the house
                                    till evening when we three men each took a "jook." Alvin was gone
                                    up on Jake's Foster 40; I went down to the road. John Fowler and his father
                                    were looking at his wheat prospect and I passed a little while with them.
                                    Subsequently John found Father and they also canvassed the subject of wheat. Father
                                    had gone up the creek. I wrote part of a letter to Grandmother One of my teeth hurt
                                    most of the forenoon.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Monday, May 2nd</p>
                        <p>It rained nearly all the time in varying quantity from shower to drizzle from early
                                    morn dewy eve. Father put the harrow together—wrong which was perhaps
                                    owing to the presence of John Kivett and Bill Hand who were here this morning. I
                                    know not on what business. They left about 9 o'clock, Father going with
                                    them on the assessment errand. Alvin and I put the harrow together as we thought it
                                    should be; and spent a good part of the time to scraping off the whitewash in the
                                    fireplace room, a very hard, tedious; strength requiring task. Aleck Benge made
                                    another call after both sweet and sour milk; this afternoon</p>
                        <p rend="center">Tuesday, May 3rd</p>
                        <p>A cool partly cloudy day again. Father again tackled the harrow and after some
                                    changing around got it to suit him. We put it on a small patch just below the
                                    garden. After harrowing the stalks down I plowed it. That portion next the
                                    cow-stable was hard and made big clods but the new implement scratched the clods
                                    mostly out of existence at least on top. It was noon when I got that patch done.
                                    After dinner assisted by Alvin I plowed and harrowed the garden. The plow
                                    would'n't scour any better than it used to but the ground broke up
                                    generally very mellow. That done I made twenty-two hills without putting any
                                    "fertilizers" in them and planted in them some watermelon seeds. I
                                    made the hills about three inches high. Mother and Alvin cleansed the habilments of
                                    the household and Alvin scraped manfully at his whitewash job Wat was here a moment
                                    this forenoon on business.</p>

                        <p>This was a business day here. Bill Hand came and finished cutting his corn-stubs
                                    leaving the tall stalks for me to cut sometime with the stalk cutter. Father and I
                                    went over to Fowler's and got the stalk-cutter. I cut till about ten
                                    o'clock on the stalks south of Hand's wheat; and the crooked
                                    field. Meanwhile John Fowler and Oily Hinson came and went to work picking the
                                    chunks off John's wheat. They got that done about ten o'clock and
                                    John then ran the stalk-cutter till night. I began plowing a land which included the
                                    "crooked patch." Mr. J.J. Hinson was here most of the forenoon
                                    counseling, and advising John, and picking himself out a barrel of seed corn at our
                                    crib. The clouds thickened up and it rained in small showers till about four o clock
                                    and it was after that time when I got to plowing again. Father did not get started
                                    on his tour till ten o'clock and after. Alvin was occupied the greater part
                                    of the time at his scratching job. Aleck and a small Benge whose cognomination is
                                    unknown to me came in the evening; Aleck after his usual portion of milk.</p>

                        <p>It rained two or three hard showers in the forenoon and drizzled more or less till
                                    two or three o'clock. Father got started pretty early. Alvin scratched all
                                    day and about all that he was able. I helped him a little—not much. I
                                    wandered around considerably; made another unsuccessful attempt to raise the
                                    water-gate in the creek spent a little while with Bill Dezearn who was plowing his
                                    patch above, and as a general thing I did'n't do much of anything</p>
                        <p rend="center">Friday, May 6th</p>
                        <p>A very hot day. A heavy fog hung over till perhaps nine o'clock, then the
                                    sun came out and though masses of heavy clouds floated over it made no abatement of
                                    the heat. I finished the plowing the land begun Wednesday; got the stalk-cutter and
                                    mangled the stalks on the Benge patch, then plowed that and finally took the plow up
                                    into the N.W. corner of Hand's wheat field and plowed up a small patch for
                                    sweet potatoes. At night I was too hot and my head felt too bad to eat any supper. I
                                    drank a cup of coffee and vomited it again. Alvin scratched till five
                                    o'clock when he called it done and rejoiced in spirit thereat. Father went
                                    afoot to town this morning. John F. commenced breaking up his field on the side next
                                    the road. His father sent for and got the stalk-cutter again this afternoon. I <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-075-2-092"/> finished and sent my letter to Grandmother this
                                    morning and we received one from her this evening. She writes that she is in poor
                                    health, dizzy-headed and has a bad cold. She lives almost alone now. Mr. Silas R.
                                    Sulye who married her sister Elizabeth died a few days ago aged nearly 80. He lived
                                    at Galena, [<placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <p>I have forgotten to state that Jap Foster came yesterday morning and borrowed the

                        <p>The weather was a great deal like that of yesterday without the fog. I rested from my
                                    labors during the greater part of the day. Father and Alvin went to town tolerably
                                    early and got back about four o'clock. They brought the skeleton of the old
                                    hack. It has new wheels, two springs behind, new spindles but not much new paint on
                                    it. They also brought some "stone ochre" paint to put on the walls
                                    of the fireplace room and some "drop black" to be used in painting
                                    the hack I suppose. John finished cutting stalks and plowed a good deal besides. I
                                    spent the time while the rest were gone mostly with him and in running around with
                                    Sayroy Kivett who was hunting squirrels. In the evening I hitched to the
                                    stalk-cutter and cut the stalks in Bill Hand's wheat and a few in the field
                                    below it. The hot weather is spreading greenness very fast.</p>

                        <p>Very warm. Thunder showers around but a very small amount of rain here. I made out to
                                    go to the creek church, where "Lord's Day School" was
                                    attended by a, for that place fair-sized crowd. Services devoid of much
                                    "intensity" I hoofed it down to Wat's and Bain's
                                    for awhile in the evening, had a little fun and got home about 9 o'clock.
                                    Father went up to Foster's and vicinity after dinner. "The rest of
                                    us" did'n't do any noteworthy deeds.</p>

                        <p>Before breakfast came Hemp Lewis and about ten o'clock he departed again
                                    with a bushel of seed corn. I plowed all the forenoon on the east side of the field
                                    south of Hand's wheat and cut stalk till 4.30 o'clock on the west
                                    side of it. Father departed on the assessment errand shortly after Lewis left. Alvin
                                    painted the hack-skeleton the first time; worked in the garden and chored around
                                    occasionally It was very warm but the clouds afforded some respite from the
                                    sun's heat. It sprinkled <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-075-2-093"/> rain once in
                                    a while till 4.30 o'clock when a hard dashing shower came up and I
                                    did'n't work any more in the field. Bill Hand came after the rain
                                    to get some "Bloody Butcher" seed corn but
                                    could'n't find much. Bob Foster boys brought the fro home about
                                    the same time. John F. did'n't work in his contract to-day. Pap
                                    got to town before he came home Bill H. took away the corn drill.</p>

                        <p>It rained pretty hard for awhile between four and five o'clock in the
                                    morning but did not give us any more. Before nine o'clock I went to plowing
                                    again where I quit yesterday. Plowed till noon when I finished that
                                    "land." After dinner I finished cutting stalks on this side of the
                                    creek and began plowing a land in the same field on the side next to
                                    Fowler's Mr. Daniel Kirk<hi rend="sup">89</hi> spent most of the forenoon
                                    picking out half a bushel of seed corn from our crib. He was very particular. Father
                                    staid at home or not far from it all day and was occupied in painting and otherwise
                                    fixing the hack most of the time. Alvin helped him and also helped Mother wash. The

                        <p>I plowed all day on the "land" begun yesterday. (My day's
                                    work generally last 8 or 9 hours.) It was still very warm and at noon the

                                    profusely. Father drove the old Curtis sow, which has been fattening ever since she
                                    ate her pigs. She weighed 440 lbs. and for $4.50 per cwt. It was sundown

                                    here again after his milk or milks perhaps it would be more proper to say.</p>

                        <p>Still warmer. The same kind of weather, breezes, clouds etc., but the heat
                                    intensified I finished my "land" by ten o'clock and began
                                    on the one between the two already broken, which I plowed till night. Father was
                                    around all day Alvin and he fixed the water-fence across the creek down at the road
                                    which I hope will keep the roaming swine out. He also fixed the small water gate
                                    across the little creek on Fowler's line, and chored around at various
                                    things. Alvin was occupied a good part of his time in making screen frames for the
                                    windows. John F. and his father-in-law were in his contract all day harrowing and
                                    furrowing off. They were up at the house a short time in the evening—on
                                    what business I have not yet found out. The melon seeds are up and on them by the
                                    dozen are the striped bugs John and his father in-law I have omitted to write, began
                                    planting about four o clock in John's field</p>
                        <p rend="center">Friday, May 13th.</p>
                        <p>John and Oily planted all day and must have got nearly, if not quite done. I finished
                                    plowing the last "land" in the field below Hand's wheat
                                    about 9.30 o'clock. I hitched to the harrow and scratched; firstly the
                                    patch plowed May 3rd; secondly; the crooked field; thirdly; "Aleck
                                    Benge's patch" and lastly commenced on the side next to Fowler of
                                    the field I had been plowing in last. Father went in various directions and did
                                    various things, the most important of which was to go and get A. Benge to plant corn
                                    tomorrow, for us. He started after another horse but did'n't get
                                    farther than Fowler's, he piled chunks in the "clover
                                    patch" and burned them, he mended fence, he and Alvin set out a lot of
                                    sweet potato plants 250 or so in number, in the patch broken last Friday, and Alvin
                                    and he fooled some more with the hack. Alvin was also employed in the screen
                                    business. It was large warm (92° in the shade) with few clouds. Those
                                    roaming swine <hi rend="i">did</hi> get in again but where no one knows certainly</p>
                        <p rend="center">Saturday, May 14th.</p>
                        <p>But we found out this morning that they got in under the plank just across the big
                                    creek. Alvin and I went to R. J. Foster's with the wagon after the
                                    corn-drill. Aleck was promptly on hand with his old beast. He planted the patch <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-075-2-095"/> where he had corn last year and the crooked
                                    field then went home for dinner. Father and I went to town in the hack the old
                                    "bed" on the new "skeleton." The rather fresh
                                    paint got pretty well sanded. Pap purchased paint to put on the fireplace room,
                                    (stone ochre taking too long to dry) besides some other things We were back home by
                                    one o'clock. It had been very warm up to that time and a storm gathered in
                                    the north and west. There was a good deal of wind and some thunder but only a small
                                    (comparatively) fall of rain took place here. Aleck was around but only got to plant
                                    a few rows. Visitors; Jap Foster after his father's mail and Mr. Henry
                                    Fowler after some lime which we had brought out for him from town. Short visits both
                                    made.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Sunday, May 15th.</p>
                        <p>There was a fall of 34° in the temperature between yesterday noon and this
                                    morning and all day a cool wind blew and blew hard. The thermometer indicated
                                    92° at 12 o clock yesterday. Wat came up to salt his cattle and I was
                                    with him for awhile, so long that I only got to "Lord's Day
                                    School" in time to see the collection taken up etc. There was the usual
                                    Social after L.D.S. Alvin went to Jake's but got back by three
                                    o'clock. About two Pap departed into the city of Ballingertown and was gone
                                    till sundown. Uncle Rip, Aunt Mary and Virgy came up in their carriage, shortly
                                    after Alvin got back. An excursion into the regions of the upper 80 was immediately
                                    taken by all of us the men walking the rest in the carriage. Father got home about
                                    sundown and after milking it was decided that the cow whose name is
                                    "Sheep" should go a visiting I was a horseback; he afoot It took
                                    considerable racing before we got them into the road and more afterward but I
                                    finally got to Wat's with them a good deal in advance of Pap. Got them back
                                    home without <hi rend="i">very</hi> much trouble.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Monday, May 16th.</p>
                        <p>A nearly clear almost uncomfortably cool day. I harrowed in the field below
                                    Hand's wheat finishing it about three o'clock, then scratched down
                                    some burs weeds etc. on a patch just on the house side of the oats. From 4.30 o
                                    clock till night I plowed on a land joining to, and below the one plowed May 3rd.
                                    Father and Alvin were occupied in painting the fireplace room the greater part of
                                    the day. Those roaming swine of Bed. O'Neal's were in again this
                                    morning. Bill Dezearn came and got the <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-075-2-096"/> harrow
                                    after I began plowing. Alice and John Foster were here a short time in the evening
                                    and got some sweet potato plants I felt rather under the weather for awhile at night
                                    but not seriously so. The old cow, Peg, has a rather small nearly white heifer calf.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Tuesday, May 17th.</p>
                        <p>The same kind of weather as yesterday but a little warmer. Father departed to do some
                                    more assessing and was gone nearly all day. Bill Hand was early on the scene and
                                    taking Dave put double lines on him and went to laying off in the field south of his
                                    wheat. It was considerable trouble and he finally took Dave into Foster's
                                    and swapped him for Bob's old roan horse Jim, for the day's work.
                                    I drilled with old Colonel. We were till 4 o'clock finishing that field,
                                    then we planted the patch immediately below the garden, and yard, (it was plowed May
                                    3rd) after which Bill plowed on the land I began yesterday till nearly sundown, when
                                    he took the drill up to Foster's. I went with him and got Dave. Alvin
                                    painted all the blessed day, one thing and another. We had only one visitor at the
                                    house; Aleck Benge after his milk supply, but several more running about the place
                                    etc.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Wednesday, May 18th.</p>
                        <p>Weather still the same, no warmer but more clouds. The head of the house departed
                                    once more and was gone all day assessing. He struck town before he got back home. I
                                    finished the land begun Monday, about 9.30 o'clock and went to back
                                    furrowing one below it. At noon made Bill Dezearn bring the harrow home, and I
                                    harrowed the land I had finished in the morning after which I plowed till night.
                                    Bill took the harrow off again the minute I was done and also borrowed the single-
                                    shovel plow, and open ring Alvin painted, varnished squizzed and helped Mother wash.
                                    Father brought home a letter from Grandmother and also one from Frona. Grandmother
                                    appears to be in good health, spirits and state of mind. Flave's are

                        <p>Weather precisely as yesterday except that it was warmer through the day. John Dilly
                                    came soon and after some picking over got what seemed to me a half bushel of seed
                                    corn. Mr. David Bothwell<hi rend="sup">92</hi> came on the same errand about nine
                                    o'clock but, as Pap had already gone to Willis O'Neals's,
                                    he went on up to Foster's, and got his seed corn there. Father got back
                                    home between ten and eleven o'clock and went to putting down carpet in the
                                    fireplace room after which things were moved back and seemed to resume their normal
                                    condition. I finished the "land" <hi rend="i">begun</hi>
                                    yesterday, plowed a strip which was left between it and the land <hi rend="i">finished</hi> yesterday and by four o'clock had it all harrowed. Pap
                                    then went to laying off and I taking Hemp and the sled went over on
                                    Foster's place and got the drill. It was pretty hard pulling. After I got
                                    home. Alvin rode Hemp and guided him and I drilled till night in that way. John
                                    Kivett was here a little while and got four of his fruit cans in the evening</p>
                        <p rend="center">Friday, May 20th.</p>
                        <p>Weather still unchanged; thermometer indicated 87° at noon. While Father
                                    finished planting the ground he began on yesterday evening, Alvin and I plowed the
                                    two patches of Early Rose potatoes, he riding and guiding Hemp, and I trying to hold
                                    the double-shovel. The patch above the "orchard" was very tough
                                    and leathery with sod, the other one easy. Both planting and potato plowing were
                                    done by 8.30. I back furrowed a small strip of ground between the oats and the
                                    ground just planted then Father and I harrowed it and the patch that was broken for
                                    oats and not sowed. In this last mentioned the clods were very hard and we had to
                                    leave it; the other strip we planted. After dinner we carted most of the tools
                                    across the creek and between us cut the stalks on what was last year the clover-
                                    patch. Father also did some grubbing over there and I struck off a
                                    "land" and plowed a few rounds before quitting time. Father and
                                    Alvin set out another batch of sweet potato plants, making the ridges in the
                                    "Benge patch." R. J. Foster came and got the corn-drill at noon
                                    and Bill Dezearn the harrow. Bill got the old Dudley plow yesterday to lay off with
                                    when we took the single shovel away from him. Alvin has for the past two days been
                                    mainly employed about the house doing odd jobs too numerous to mention</p>

                        <p>It grew a little hotter to-day and there were clouds and slight indications of rain
                                    at night Rain is needed, for the roads are dry, and dusty, the ground is hard, and
                                    things have about quit growing, Father and I went to town in the hack, starting
                                    pretty early. When we got to Wat's Albert Bishop went along as passenger.
                                    Pap bought him a second-hand mattress, and "one-hoss" black walnut
                                    bedstead at Mrs. Jennie Potter's sale. He also got a little more paint, a
                                    kit of fish, and some other things. We were back before one o'clock. Nearly
                                    everything had been taken out of the big room and Alvin was doubing on the whitewash
                                    when we got home. I got to plowing across the creek about theee o'clock;
                                    finished the "land" I began yesterday and plowed some on another
                                    one. Mr. Henry Fowler got the stalk-cutter cut what he wanted to and sent it clear
                                    home at night. Bill Dezearn brought home the harrow and Dudley awhile after noon.
                                    Father was employed on miscellaneous jobs during the afternoon and Alvin finished
                                    whitewashing. Mrs. Nancy Benge came to-day after the Benge supply of milks, and also
                                    some soap or soap grease neither of which except the milk, she got.</p>

                        <p>A day in which the sun shone through a hazy veil of clouds and felt hotter than
                                    yesterday. Not much indication of rain. No one of us got off the place or far from
                                    the house till two o'clock when I went a-horseback to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. A pretty good sized congregation listened to Mr. Moore as he preached
                                    on the old subject of the prodigal son. Truth compels me to say that he seemed to me
                                    to handle the subject as well or better than the great Poucher did last February. I
                                    stopped at Fowler's a short time as I came home. I found Wat, Em and the
                                    children just arrived here but of course they could'n't stay long.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Monday, May 23rd.</p>
                        <p>A warm very drying day with some clouds and considerable feeble rain indications. I
                                    plowed from morning till six o'clock beginning on the last land about five.
                                    From six till night Father plowed. Alvin spent the livelong day in painting the
                                    woodwork doors etc. of the big room. Father skirmished about as overseer and general
                                    assistant of all that was going on. The Rev. Mr. Moore spent three hours or so, and
                                    ate dinner with us. <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-075-2-099"/> He was given an order on

                        <p>A hot day (90° at noon) with streaky clouds overspreading the sky and a
                                    shower in the south at night near enough for us to hear a little thunder. There was
                                    one at greater distance last night. I and Father by turns finished plowing the field
                                    across the crick by noon and harrowed it in the afternoon. I had much the longest
                                    turns however as he only worked at it about two hours in all. The rest of the time
                                    he was skirmishing around at nothing in particular. Dan Bain came soon to inform us
                                    of hogs in John's corn, which had got away with about a half acre of it.
                                    They were fenced out. Frank Dezearn was here a goodly portion of the afternoon,
                                    gassing to Pap. He said he came to look at Hemp the hoss with an idea of buying.
                                    There was not a great deal of work at the big room to-day owing to the
                                    week's washing having to be done.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Chronicle of the Overbeck Pottery.</hi> By Kathleen R. Postle. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Indiana Historical Society, 1978. Pp. 109. Illustrations, notes, appendixes,
                    bibliography, index. Paperbound, $12.50.)</head>
            <p>Kathleen R. Postle is uniquely qualified to tell the saga of the Overbeck Pottery: she grew up as an
                    Overbeck neighbor. "I always knew the Overbecks," she tells the reader,
                    "I cannot recall when I did not visit the house casually and frequently" (p. 9).
                    This well-researched book chronicles the history and background of the Overbeck sisters (changed
                    from the German Overpeck), the creativity that ran deep in the whole family, the preparation,
                    influences, and training for establishing their pottery, their remarkable productivity,
                    publications, exhibitions, and eventual recognition, but it is also more than that. The author goes
                    on to assess the Overbecks' artistry within the larger perspective of art movements in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the first half of the twentieth century with an objective view of the Overbeck
                    contribution to American ceramic art.</p>
            <p>Paul Evans, in his introduction, remarks on the prominent role played by women in the American art
                    pottery movement. Elizabeth Overbeck once wrote that their pottery was "altogether a
                    woman's enterprise both in its origin and conception" (p. 50). Establishing a
                    pottery "was highly innovative for young women in a midwestern town in the early part of
                    this century" (p. 50). Of the six Overbeck sisters, the three most involved in the pottery
                    could scarcely have imagined the present-day nationwide popularity of pottery making for which they
                    were trail-breaking precursors. In light of the recent Oriental stoneware mystique it is interesting
                    to note that for the Overbecks there was no room for the "happy accident" of the
                    Japanese potter. They believed the potter's original concept must be followed <hi rend="i">exactly.</hi> And this is what they did.</p>
            <p>Some kind of genealogical chart with dates would have been helpful in keeping the sisters identified
                    in the reader's mind: Margaret, the catalyst-teacher; Hanna, the designer- watercolorist;
                    Harriet, the musician-housekeeper; Elizabeth, the ceramic technician; and Mary, the potter-painter.</p>
            <p>The author is keenly sympathetic to the nuances of personalities, interrelationships, and the life
                    stresses of these creative artists; sensitive, talented, reticent, but fortified with a staunch
                    integrity. "There was considerable iron in the make-up of these women, with their
                    philosophy of ascetic life, hard work, and discipline" (p. 86). "They lived unto
                    themselves, with <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-075-2-101"/> commitment only to themselves and their drive
                    to create" (p. 27). Postle has, in this work, clearly placed the Overbecks in the company
                    of legendary American art potters.</p>

            <p>Compared to most American bicentennial symposia, the 1978 Indiana Symposium was outstanding. It
                    attracted a distinguished slate of scholars who offered fresh insights and interpretations on the
                    prosaic subject of public land history in the new nation. The result is this slim but valuable
                    addition to the literature of midwestern frontier history. The five panelists were Hildegard Binder
                    Johnson, the leading landscape geographer in America; Paul W. Gates, the nestor of land historians;
                    frontier specialist and ethnohistorian, Dwight C. Smith; and two younger institutional scholars of
                    the Old Northwest, Malcom Rohrbough, an expert on the General Land Office, and Reginald Horsman, a
                    long-time student of Indian-white relations. Although the presentations were prepared for a general
                    audience, frontier and land specialists will also find the book valuable.</p>
            <p>The essays are arranged from the general to the specific—from the land itself to the
                    political impact of land policy. In the opening essay, "Perceptions and Illustrations of
                    the American Landscape in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley and the Midwest," Johnson expands on a theme developed in her recent
                    book, <hi rend="i">Order Upon the Land</hi> (1976), that modern students of the frontier can employ
                    the techinque of "visual thinking" to study pictures, maps, and even the
                    rectangular land survey patterns in order to learn how early Americans perceived their environment.
                    To buttress her thesis that pictorial evidence is a valuable complement to oral history, Johnson
                    offers some twenty-nine illustrations, including a land survey map, a county atlas, and paintings
                    and prints by George Caleb Bingham, Carl Bodmer, John James Audubon, George Henry Durrie and others.
                    Farmstead sketches in county atlases, for example, are described as " the Middle
                    West's peculiar pictorial contribution to the documentation of rural settlement,
                    line-mindedness, and pride of property" (p.33).</p>
            <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-075-2-102"/>
            <p>How the farmers obtained their prideful property is Rohrbough's theme in "The Land
                    Office Business in Indiana, 1800–1840." Indiana was the laboratory for testing
                    early public land policy, Rohrbough explains, and William Henry Harrison was the chief designer.
                    Readers acquainted with the author's <hi rend="i">Land Office Business</hi> (1968) will
                    find the Indiana story familiar, but the retelling is deft and concise, and Rohrbough's
                    knack for turning an apt phrase is evident. There are indications that Rohrbough had softened his
                    critical 1968 assessment of government land policy and the adverse impact of land speculation. Here
                    readers are told, in reference to the credit system of 1800–1820, that the government was
                    an "understanding, generous and sympathetic landlord," "loose and
                    tolerant" of Indiana's "incipient capitalists" who
                    "flouted" basic honesty to obtain land and gain "economic independence
                    and a world generally free from want and care for the future" (pp. 47, 55, 56).</p>
            <p>Horsman's highly interpretive historiographical essay, "Changing Images of the
                    Public Domain," is alone worth the price of the book. Gates' work is discussed
                    with particular subtlety and insight. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Horsman's
                    interpretation of Frederick Jackson Turner, who is portrayed—solely on the basis of the
                    1893 frontier essay—as an apologist of the government's democratic, free land
                    policy. In fact Turner's subsequent writings and those of his students, notably Benjamin H.
                    Hibbard, condemned federal land policies for fostering large-scale speculation rather than
                    small-scale farming. Even less satisfactory is Horsman's impassioned and polemical (one is
                    tempted to say irrational) outburst against the new economic land historians, a response that
                    resembles the reaction of some to Robert Fogel's and Stanley Engerman's <hi rend="i">Time on the Cross.</hi> Specifically, Horsman cites Donald Winters' and this
                    reviewer's work on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> farm tenancy and large-scale speculation, respectively, as prime examples of the
                    "dehumanizing" effects of quantitative methods and growth-oriented, neoclassical
                    economics. "One has the feeling," the author opines in commenting on
                    Winters' study of farm tenancy and my public approbation of it, "that if in late
                    nineteenth-century America a good market had developed for the sale of children, and if in order to
                    raise capital to develop their farms <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> farmers found it necessary to sell their children, an economic historian would be found
                    who would consider that the practice of selling children was for ‘rational economic
                    reasons’" (p. 77). Some may wonder why rather mundane analyses of land, tax
                    titles, and mortgage instruments should elicit such an <hi rend="i">ad hominem</hi> response. <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-075-2-103"/> "If the time has come to revise the revisers"
                    (p. 80), as Horsman contends, then by all means get on with the research task.</p>
            <p>Equally puzzling is Dwight Smith's brief essay on the history of Indian-white land
                    tenureship in which the author offers a startling reinterpretation of the legal charades that are
                    euphemistically called "Indian land cession treaties." According to Smith, such
                    arrangements were "valid instruments" to transfer Indian rights to the land,
                    because such treaties were rooted in Anglo-Saxon law and because they were an
                    "effective" transfer vehicle that "bridged the legal gap between the two
                    diverse cultures and it transferred title to the land" (p. 99). Such pragmatic and circular
                    logic is not altogether satisfying.</p>
            <p>In the book's final contribution, Gates convincingly proves that the national
                    government's continued ownership of extensive underdeveloped lands in Indiana and other
                    early public land states was both unpopular and detrimental economically and especially politically.
                    Controlling large land holdings provided the central government with a strong instrument by which to
                    influence and even dominate the economic development policies of the states, as is the case in
                    Alaska at the present time. Students of nineteenth-century land history can only applaud the
                    publication of this book and lament that most bicentennial efforts did not yield such rich results.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The History of Education in the Middle West</hi> contains two extended essays which were
                    presented in 1976 and 1977 as part of a lecture series sponsored by the Indiana Historical Society.
                    Although the Society should be commended for making these excellent papers available to the public,
                    the title is inappropriate and misleading. The first essay, by Timothy L. Smith, is entitled
                    "Uncommon Schools: Christian Colleges and Social Idealism in Midwestern America,
                    1820–1950"; the second, "Education in Utopia: The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Experience," was written by Donald E. Pitzer. Smith, claiming that
                    "the religious and educational history" of Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> "was a microcosm of both regional and national experience" (p. 3),
                    limits his <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-075-2-104"/> discussion to those two states; Pitzer's
                    emphasis is obvious. The two essays do not individually or collectively provide <hi rend="i">The
                        History of Education in the Middle West.</hi> "Uncommon Schools" is an
                    interpretative synthesis of the role of church colleges in the social and cultural development of
                    Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Wisely disregarding the histories of individual institutions, Smith is more concerned
                    with such questions as why church schools were established, the nativity and roles of educational
                    leaders, sources of financial support, and the nature of the curriculum. Subsequent sections added
                    to the original paper examine the trend toward sectarianism which emerged in the 1850s and the
                    changing character of church schools in urban environments. Smith's essay is exceptionally
                    well-researched and convincingly provides new insights into the history of education.</p>
            <p>Being a product of one of these institutions, thoroughly steeped in the traditions of a liberal arts
                    education, and teaching at another institution currently agonizing over the value of general
                    education requirements, this reviewer cannot resist quoting one of Smith's quotations.
                    Admittedly a bit chauvinistic for today, it still illustrates the value of history.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>One capital and fatal error has been the idea that we should send a boy to school to learn to
                        WORK, and not simply to THINK; thus absurdly attempting to teach, by public endowment and
                        munificence, the little arts of PERSONAL MANIPULATION, instead of the magnificent SCIENCE of
                        UNIVERSAL SUCCESS. Nothing could be more fatal. When I have taught a boy merely to hold a plow,
                        I have only taught him to be a two-legged jackass, twin brother of the team in front of him. But
                        when I have taught him truly and scientifically all the mighty mysteries of seas, stars, oceans,
                        lands and ages that are concerned in that act of plowing, I have made a man of him …

            <p>Pitzer's essay discusses the uses of education in the Utopian communities of Harmony and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Focusing briefly on the major sources which inspired them, he examines the
                    educational theories of George Rapp, Robert Owen, and William Maclure in some detail and then
                    demonstrates how these ideas were put into practice. The educational systems they attempted to
                    implement were, Pitzer correctly concludes, remarkably progressive. Among the innovations attributed
                    to these men were Rapp's emphasis on universal education for both sexes and vocational
                    training, Owen's infant and adult programs and his attempts to integrate his views on
                    communitarianism into the educative process, and Maclure's pioneering efforts in
                    establishing an industrial/trade school.</p>

            <p>Both essays contribute significantly to the literature in social and intellectual history and provide
                    excellent examples of how the history of education should be written.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, that Owen explains his differences with his father, Robert Owen, over the
                    practices, though not the principles, of the "Community of Equality" on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>; and here he writes to his sister, concerning Wright, "I am no more likely to
                    fall in love … with her than with yourself" (p. 40).</p>
            <p>Readers may find modern parallels in Owen's observations about the novelty of the giraffe in
                    the Jardin des Plantes—"its figure is … in every window of prints, on
                    every stage coach; and even the hawkers of gingerbread … [<hi rend="i">give</hi>] to
                    their cakes the form of the Giraffe" (p. 45)—and in General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s explanation of the excesses of the French
                    Revolution—"emissaries sent from the English … assumed the garb and
                    language of staunch republicans only to urge acts of cruelty and bloodshed" (p. 50).</p>
            <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-075-2-106"/>
            <p>Owen was a pragmatic reporter. He discovered that the jaws of a shark caught at sea were large enough
                    to receive his head easily. But he may also have been a gullible man. The appendix contains an
                    account of his experience years later with a spiritualist who, "in exactly twenty-eight
                    minutes" (p. 67) drew a strikingly accurate portrait of Frances Wright's sister,
                    whom the artist had never seen and who had been dead some thirty-six years.</p>
            <p>Only one small error was noted in this otherwise excellent production: Owen's journal states
                    that "nearly opposite Havre is the village of Gonfleur" (p. 34). Here, unless the
                    printer erred, either the author misspelled or the editor misread Honfleur.</p>

            <p>Trying to write this nation's religious history is "like swimming in muddy
                    water," said an eminent and venerable historian in 1960. At that time perhaps he was right.
                    Considerable confusion then existed in the American mind about the difference between church and
                    Christianity, on the one hand, and Christianity and religion, on the other. This confusion was both
                    reflected in and perpetuated by countless works about American religion in which the separation of
                    church and state was celebrated and the distinction between state and church made plain. Other
                    distinctions, however, were so blurred that—from the 1840s when Robert Baird made the
                    first important survey of the religious scene in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> until the 1950s when William <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> Sweet finished working—studies of American religion were concerned almost
                    exclusively with this nation's Christian churches. But that situation has changed
                    dramatically in the last fifteen years. Sidney Mead made differentiation between church and
                    Christianity sharp enough in his <hi rend="i">Lively Experiment</hi> (1963) to reveal how mistaken
                    is the notion that American churches and American Christianity are synonymous. Robert
                    Bellah's 1967 essay on "civil religion" showed that, despite the minimal
                    importance here of religious formulations totally divorced from the Judeo- Christian tradition,
                    Christianity and religion are likewise not <pb n="218" id="VAA4025-075-2-107"/> one and the same in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Martin Marty worked through some of the implications of making these careful
                    distinctions in <hi rend="i">Righteous Empire</hi> (1970). Sydney Ahlstrom carried the course of
                    rigorous discrimination forward by choosing to write <hi rend="i">A Religious History of the
                        American People</hi> (1972) rather than a history of American religion. And now, Robert T. Handy
                    has pushed the clarification process to its outer limits and cleared away the muddy water by writing
                        <hi rend="i">A History of the Churches in the <placeName>
                     <country reg="-us">United
                            States</country> and <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                  </placeName>
               </hi>, a work which
                    makes no pretense of being anything other than what it is: an institutional history of
                    America's churches.</p>
            <p>As does all good institutional history, this account places much emphasis on organizational structure
                    and leadership; as does all good church history, it puts stress on ecclesiastical doctrine and
                    polity, modes of worship, and patterns of belief. But since his work is a part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s series on the <hi rend="i">History of the Christian Church</hi>, placing
                    American church history in the larger context of the history of all organized Christendom was
                    Handy's overriding concern. Therefore, major attention rests on the clergy rather than the
                    laity (so much so that the book is a veritable directory of church leaders and their
                    accomplishments); changes in ecclesiastical structure are viewed from the standpoint of church
                    precedent as well as within the innovative organizational arrangements which developed in the new
                    world; and belief patterns and worship modes are related to traditional Christian theology and
                    practice as much as to the indigenous cultural situation.</p>
            <p>This work is not valuable simply because it sets the church history of North America in a wider
                    framework and because it is a church history which refuses to masquerade as a history of religion.
                    New ground is broken with the adding of the history of the churches in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> to the already familiar story of what happened to the churches in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. As important as this addition is, however, its proper integration into the story
                    required a straightforward presentation of the materials. Such an organization precluded the
                    systematic use of some scheme of taxonomy—the location of American churches along an
                    evangelical-liturgical continuum, for example—which in the past has been employed to
                    impose order on the chaotic ecclesiastical situation in this nation. The result is a choppy
                    narrative that moves forward from the time of settlement until the day before yesterday, with the
                    focus shifting back and forth from coverage of all the many ecclesiastical developments in one
                    geographical region to a like coverage of a multiplicity of <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-075-2-108"/>
                    churches and church-related events in another. The book is a worthy reference tool, but read
                    straight through, it makes even church history seem to be "just one damned thing after
                    another."</p>

            <p>This important book is more than a major contribution to business history. Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.,
                    describes and explains the rise of modern managerial capitalism and the business class that controls
                    and directs it. His book, therefore, is a significant analysis of the nature of modern American
                    society.</p>
            <p>Unlike many economists who view the economy through the lens of supply and demand in the marketplace,
                    Chandler stresses the imperatives of technological change and innovation. In those industries in
                    which technology speeded production and distribution, business leaders faced new opportunities and
                    new problems. The economies of speed allowed for mass production and distribution and the potential
                    for massive profits but also created problems of organization and control. The free market no longer
                    adequately served to supply raw materials and fuel and to move finished goods to the consumer.
                    Business leaders therefore "internalized" both the acquisition of needed supplies
                    and the distribution of finished goods. "The visible hand of managerial direction had
                    replaced the invisible hand of market forces in coordinating the flow of goods from the suppliers of
                    raw and semifinished materials to the retailer and ultimate consumer" (p. 286).</p>
            <p>Big business, therefore, was created by business leaders seeking not only to eliminate competition in
                    order to control prices and otherwise mitigate the rigors of competition but also—and
                    more importantly—to control and coordinate the flow of supplies and the distribution of
                    finished goods. Only industries capable of mass production and distribution experienced successful
                    consolidations. Where tools and machines merely replaced hand labor (for example, in construction or
                    clothing manufacturing) consolidation brought diseconomies. But in other industries, such as steel,
                    electrical equipment, and chemicals, <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-075-2-109"/> technology made possible
                    "continuous-process production" which not only replaced hand labor but
                    restructured the entire production process, bringing startling increases in output. Where production
                    remained discontinuous, business remained small and price competitive and continued to rely upon the
                    market for supplies and distribution. Elsewhere, firms became big
                    businesses—oligopolies—which internalized their acquisition of supplies and
                    their distribution network. The huge firms required revolutionary changes in management, and control
                    passed from owners to specially trained and experienced managers.</p>
            <p>A brief review can only sketch in the outlines of this rich, closely argued, and meticulously
                    documented book. It is at once a general history of American business and an explanation for the
                    rise of big business as a peculiarly modern phenomenon. It carefully summarizes the complex details
                    of the history of individual firms and at the same time enhances the general understanding of the
                    social and economic history of modern America. While doing all of this it considers a whole range of
                    problems that have vexed historians over the past generation—for example, the role of
                    railroads in American economic development, the place of the robber barons in the history of
                    business, and the contributions of financiers and expanding capital markets to economic development.
                    And, finally, the book is beautifully written and clearly organized.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps unfair to criticize a book that promises and delivers so much. Yet there are certain
                    areas that Chandler ignores or treats very lightly. He gives inadequate attention to the role of
                    business leaders in managing demand and in managing politics, and, by choosing to ignore labor, he
                    fails to consider the significance of the efforts of business leaders to manage and control the work
                    force. These are areas that other scholars might profitably pursue, armed with the insights and the
                    data Chandler provides in this monumental volume.</p>

                    index. Clothbound, $8.95; paperbound $7.50.) <hi rend="i">Copshaholm</hi> is a
                    fascinating account of what has become an American stereotype—the "rags to
                    riches" family enterprise of the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. <hi rend="i">The Oliver Story</hi> is the story of the Oliver chilled plow and the two men, James
                    Oliver and his son Joseph, who parlayed genius, energy, business skill, and an expansive and
                    congenial economic environment into a family fortune. With only a few changes this book might also
                    be the story of Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford. Joan Romine had access to an abundance of privately
                    held material, and she has used it well. While the Oliver family and their business activities
                    intermesh to form a single focus, the author also casts light upon an important secondary
                    development—the emergence of <placeName>

                    ninety-two year old author takes the reader back to his growing-up days on an isolated farm in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana. His lucid memory is filled with vivid pictures of life before the turn of the
                    century. "What an unforgettable experience to arise early in the morning, behold for a few
                    moments the rosy fingers of dawn … dispelling the fogs down in the valley, and walk
                    barefoot across the lush pasture through the bluegrass and white clover baptized with pearly drops
                    of dew." He tells of the hard work on the farm—clearing the forest, planting and
                    harvesting, digging a well, and hog butchering; and he also tells of the fun times—a
                    wedding night chivaree, "snipe" hunting, the one-room school, and the old-time
                    games they played. This is a cozy little book to spend an evening with in front of a log fire. <hi rend="i">Kenneth P. McCutchan, <placeName>

                    nineteenth-century Hoosiers regularly declared their dedication to mass education in general and to
                    the significance of public libraries in particular. It was not until the latter part of the century,
                    however, that adequate funds and a public willingness to be taxed for educational and <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-075-2-111"/> cultural programs made possible the beginnings of a genuine public
                    school and library system. In the meantime the history of schools and libraries was marked by false
                    starts, frustrations, and failure to bring reality to the ideal of an educated electorate. Most
                    counties experimented with a variety of public, private, and "mixed" libraries in
                    their efforts to acquire library services. They succeeded in the sense that they did put books into
                    the hands of some people who could not afford to buy them, but they were usually short-lived and
                    severely limited in their availability. Some experiments, like the "subscription
                    libraries," were open only to members of the "subscription company";
                    others, like the township trustee libraries, served a wider public, but were constantly plagued by a
                    shortage of funds. In her <hi rend="i">History of the Public Library in <placeName>

                    of the agency to flesh out an interesting and readable narrative. One hopes that other counties in
                    Indiana will come forward with similar studies as a contribution to understanding one of our most

                    fifty quotations from Lincoln and utterances attributed to him, arranged under ten subject
                    headings—truth, freedom, God, etc.—and provides a running commentary which
                    supplies the historical context of most of the quotations. Selected speeches, some of them
                    shortened, are also included, and there is a Lincoln chronology. Documentation is usually
                    satisfactory, but occasionally nonexistent. The majority of the quotations are identified in the
                    narrative as excerpts from Lincoln's speeches and letters, but no authority at all is cited
                    for attributing a few of the remaining statements to Lincoln. Textual inaccuracies occur in many of
                    the passages taken from speeches and letters: words are added; words are transcribed in the wrong
                    order; words are substituted; words, clauses, and even sentences are <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-075-2-112"/> omitted without the use of spaced periods to indicate ellipsis; and
                    changes are made in punctuation, spelling, capitalization, and typographical emphasis. The book is
