            <p>Abraham Lincoln first became acquainted with the works of William Shakespeare while a youth in
                    Southern Indiana.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> At this time, he read several books belonging to David

                    playwright were the speeches and soliloquies that he first learned in the old text book by Scott.
                    His appreciation of these passages indicates an intensive study of the book.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                        <hi rend="sup">4</hi> The description of Queen Mab is from near the end of the fourth
                                scene of Act I of Romeo and Juliet. Houser, in his letter of December 21, 1934, above
                                cited, says:</p>
                            <p>"I have no idea whether or not this was the first thing by Shakespeare that
                                Lincoln read. If, as some suppose, he first read that author in this book, and he read
                                the articles in this book consecutively, it then, of course, would be. It is an
                                interesting speculation.</p>
                            <p>"It appears that Queen Mab was first mentioned by Irish poets, probably
                                Shakespeare got the idea from them, and later poets, generally, notably Shelly, got the
                                thought from Shakespeare. In Celtic folk-lore, we are told Queen Mab was midwife of the
                                fairies. In the lines omitted in Scott's work (Robert Bailey, <placeName>
                                    <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                                </placeName>, Pa., 1805) Mercutio speaks of her more as a witch, saying:<quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>This is the very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night.</p>

                                believed that witches rode the horses at night, and tangled their manes."</p>

                    selections from Julius Caesar, Hamlet, Henry IV, Othello, Henry V, Richard III, and As You Like It.
                    They are grouped under section five of the book, the heading being "Speeches and
                    Soliloquies."</p>
            <p>One selection in Scott's work made an unusually lasting impression upon the mind of the

                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>

                    brother" taken from the Tragedy of Hamlet. It seems to have been Lincoln's
                    favorite: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Oh! My offence is rank; it smells to heaven;</p>
                        <p>It hath the primal, eldest curse upon it!</p>
                        <p>A brother's murder!—Pray I cannot,</p>

                        <p> And like a man to double business bound,</p>
                        <p>I stand in pause where I shall first begin—</p>
                        <p>And both neglect. What if this cursed hand</p>
                        <p>Were thicker than itself with brother's blood—</p>
                        <p>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</p>
                        <p>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy,</p>
                        <p>But to confront the visage of offence?</p>
                        <p>And what's in prayer, but this twofold force;</p>
                        <p>To be forestalled ere we come to fall—</p>
                        <p>Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up.</p>
                        <p>My fault is past. But, oh. What form or prayer</p>
                        <p>Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder,</p>
                        <p>That cannot be, since I am still possess'd</p>
                        <p>Of those effects for which I did the murder—</p>
                        <p>My crown, my own ambition, and my queen.</p>
                        <p>May one be pardoned, and retain th' offence?</p>
                        <p>In the corrupted currents of this world,</p>
                        <p>Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice;</p>
                        <p>And oft 'tis seen, the wicked prize itself</p>
                        <p>Buys out the laws, but 'tis not so above.</p>
                        <p>There is no shuffling—there the action lies</p>
                        <p>In its true nature, and we ourselves compell'd</p>
                        <p>E'en to the teeth and forehead of our faults,</p>
                        <p>To give in evidence. What then? What rests?</p>
                        <p>Try what repentance can, what can it not?</p>
                        <p>Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?</p>
                        <p>Oh, wretched state! Oh, bosom black as death!</p>
                        <p>Oh, limed soul, that struggling to be free,</p>

            <p>Little evidence is available concerning Lincoln's study of Shakespeare while he was a member
                    of Congress. However, it is known that he used much of his spare time in the Congressional Library.

                        <p>Edwin Booth was playing an engagement at this time at Grover's Theatre. He had been
                            announced for the coming evening in his famous part of Hamlet. The president had never
                            witnessed his representation of this character, and he proposed being present. The mention
                            of this play, which I afterwards learned had at all times a peculiar charm for Mr.
                            Lincoln's mind, worked up a train of thought I was not prepared for. Said
                            he,—and his words have often returned to me with a sad interest since his own
                            assassination—"There is one passage of the play
                            'Hamlet' which is very apt to be slurred over by the actor, or omitted
                            altogether, which seems to me the choicest part of the play. It is the soliloquy of the king
                            after the murder. It always struck me as one of the finest touches of nature in the
                            world."</p>

                        <p>One day (it chanced to be the day before the capture of Norfolk) as he sat reading alone, he
                            called to bis aide, Colonel LeGrand Cannon of General Wool's staff in the adjoining
                            room,—"You have been writing long enough, Colonel; come in here; I want
                            to read you a passage in Hamlet." He read the discussion on ambition between Hamlet
                            and his courtiers, and the soliloquy, in which conscience debates of a future state. This
                            was followed by passages from 'Macbeth.' Then opening to 'King
                            John' he read from the third act the passage in which Constance bewails her
                            imprisoned, lost boy.</p>
                        <p>Closing the book, and recalling the words,— "And, father Cardinal, I have

                        <p>Mr. Lincoln said: "Colonel, did you ever dream of a lost friend, and feel that you
                            were holding sweet communion with that friend, and yet have a sad consciousness that it was

            <p>In the year 1862 records show that a copy of Shakespeare's works was borrowed by the Lincoln

                    used by the President because of his intense interest in the contents. John Hay, the

                    considerable delay, the President, on August 17, sent Hackett the following letter: <text>
                  <body>
                     <div type="letter">
                        <p>Months ago I should have acknowledged the receipt of your book and accompanying kind
                                    note; and I now have to beg your pardon for not having done so.</p>
                        <p>For one of my age I have seen very little of the drama. The first presentation of
                                    Falstaff I ever saw was yours here, last winter or spring. Perhaps the best
                                    compliment I can pay is to say, as I truly can, I am very anxious to see it again.
                                    Some of Shakespeare's plays I have never read, while others I have gone
                                    over perhaps as frequently as any unprofessional reader. Among the latter are Lear,
                                    Richard III, Henry VIII, Hamlet and especially Macbeth. I think nothing equals
                                    Macbeth; I think it is wonderful.</p>
                        <p>Unlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the soliloquy in Hamlet commencing
                                    "Oh, my offence is rank," surpasses that commencing "To
                                    be or not to be." But pardon this small attempt at criticism. I should like
                                    to hear you pronounce the opening speech of Richard III. Will you not soon visit <placeName>

            <p>This letter found its way to the press and Lincoln's "small attempt at
                    criticism" proved to be his last and only venture into this field. He was severely
                    criticised by some of the newspapers for contrasting and commenting on the relative merits of
                    Shakespeare's lines.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Such a discussion continued the <placeName>

                                    of what has occurred to me through life. I have endured a great deal of ridicule
                                    without much malice; and have received a great deal of kindness, not quite free from

                    "Henry IV," the President showed a remarkable knowledge of the characterization.
                    He questioned the actor concerning the omission of the part of the play where Falstaff and Prince
                    Hal alternately assume the character of the king. Lincoln's principal criticism concerning
                    the acted plays was that important parts were omitted, while too great emphasis was placed on less
                    important passages.</p>

                            entirely misapprehended. It is quite common for an actor to come upon the stage and in a
                            sophomoric style, to begin with a flourish:—</p>
                        <p>"Now is the winter of our discontent</p>

            <p>In his comments upon Lincoln's keen interest and feeling concerning his favorite selections

                        <p>Then, unconsciously assuming the character, Mr. Lincoln repeated, also from memory,
                            Richard's soliloquy, rendering it with a degree of force and power that made it
                            seem like a new creation to me. Though familiar with the passage from boyhood, I can truly
                            say that never till that moment had I fully appreciated its spirit. I could not refrain from
                            laying down my palette and brushes, and applauding heartily, upon his conclusion, saying, at
                            the same time, half in earnest, that I was not sure but that he had made a mistake in the
                            choice of a profession, considerably, as may be imagined, to his amusement. Mr. Sinclair has
                            since repeatedly said to me that he never heard these choice passages of Shakespeare
                            rendered with more effect by the most famous of modern actors.</p>

            <p>The passages of Shakespeare which depict great grief and sorrow seem to have fastened themselves in
                    the mind of the President with a firm hold. "Richard II" has many such passages
                    and Lincoln often read and recited to his friends, one in particular in the third act where Richard
                    gives way to his pent-up grief, he was prone to quote: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    Hackett's performances in this character. Nevertheless, it is known that on several
                    occasions he severely criticised Hackett's presentations. He thought the actor misread one
                    of Falstaff s lines by placing the emphasis on the wrong word. Hackett read the line
                    "Mainly <hi rend="i">thrust</hi> at me," which, according to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>

                    the inflection of Hackett on the wrong word. It was also the President's opinion that the
                    speech of Hotspur in the play was an unnatural and unworthy thing. In Lincoln's opinion a
                    comedy was best played and a tradegy was best read. He once remarked: "It matters not to me

            <p>That Lincoln was particularly interested in Shakespeare up to the time of his death has been brought

                            Shakespeare. Most of these were from "Macbeth," and in particular the
                            verses which follow Duncan's assassination. I cannot recall this reading without
                            being awed at the remembrance, when Macbeth became King after the murder of Duncan, he fell

                    replete with references to Shakespeare's works. His vocabulary was greatly enriched by

            <p>Lincoln has commonly been represented as one whose literary education was deficient, yet he always
                    considered Shakespeare the greatest of the master poets. In all probability <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> had a deeper appreciation of Shakespeare than any other American statesman of his time.
                    This appreciation, which was started in his early life in Indiana, lasted until his untimely death
                    in 1865. Lincoln's intensive study of Shakespeare was made before his election to the
                    presidency. While president he reflected on what he had learned earlier in life of the works of the
                    great master playwright.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

                    one of the five great characters of the world. In the Memorial <placeName>

                        world would still have the best literature preserved. Shakespeare's mind was like a sea
                        to which all others in the world were as tributaries, and why should we not drink from this

            <head>Careers of Six Hoosier Candidates of 1860</head>

            </byline>
            <p>In the election of 1860, there were six candidates for state offices, three on each ticket, who were
                    destined later to figure conspicuously in national affairs and several of them in state affairs as
                    well. Three of these were to fill the governor's chair, five to serve in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate, one to become president of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and one to be speaker of the national House of Representatives. The three Republicans
                    all of whom were elected in that memorable year, were Henry S. Lane, Oliver P. Morton and Benjamin
                    Harrison; the three Democrats were Thomas A. Hendricks, David Turpie and Michael C. Kerr. Henry S.
                    Lane and Thomas A. Hendricks were the opposing candidates for governor, and Oliver P. Morton and
                    David Turpie for lieutenant-governor. Benjamin Harrison and Michael C. Kerr ran against each other
                    for reporter of the supreme court.</p>
            <p>Lane was elected governor succeeding Abram A. Hammond, who was serving out the unexpired term of
                    Ashbel P. Willard, the latter having died in office four months before the end of his term. A few
                    days after Lane was inaugurated, he was elected to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate and resigned the governorship. Morton, who had been elected lieutenant-governor,
                    succeeded him and served the full term of four years excepting the few days that had been served by
                    Lane. He is always known in history as Indiana's war governor. In 1864 he was elected to
                    the governorship and served a little over two years of that term, when he resigned to go to the
                    Senate as the successor of Lane. In the Senate he took a prominent place among the Radicals though
                    he had been a moderate reconstructionist. His career in the Senate somewhat dims the luster of his
                    reputation as governor. He died in 1877, after serving ten years as Senator.</p>
            <p>Not long after Lane's election to the Senate, his colleague Jesse Bright, was expelled from
                    that body on account of alleged sympathy with the southern confederacy. Governor Morton filled the
                    vacancy by the appointment of ex-Gov. Joseph A. Wright, a former Democrat, who was to serve until
                    the next Legislature should be elected. That body then had to elect senators for the short term and
                    the long term. <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-031-4-015"/> The Democrats won a majority of the seats in the
                    Legislature in the election of 1862. They elected David Turpie for the short term, which expired
                    March 4, 1863, and Thomas A. Hendricks for the long term, which expired March 4, 1869. <placeName>

                    </placeName> at once became a leader of the small minority of Democrats in the senate. That small
                    minority with seven independent and patriotic Republicans prevented the conviction of President
                    Johnson, who had been brought to trial by the vote of the Radical majority in the House of
                    Representatives. The Senators who stood by Johnson saved the nation from having placed upon it a
                    stain which never could have been blotted out. In 1868 while still serving in the senate and against
                    his wishes, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hendricks</region>
                    </placeName> was again nominated for governor of Indiana, but was defeated by Conrad Baker, who was
                    serving out Governor Morton's unexpired term. Afterwards Baker and Hendricks became law
                    partners in the well known firm of Baker, Hord &amp; <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hendricks</region>
                    </placeName>. In 1872 <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hendricks</region>
                    </placeName> was nominated a third time for governor and elected, though the rest of the Democratic
                    state ticket, with the exception of State Superintendent of Public Instruction, was defeated. In
                    1876 Governor Hendricks received the vice-presidential nomination, becoming the running mate of
                    Governor Samuel J. Tilden. In 1884 he ran for vice-president on the ticket with Grover Cleveland and
                    was elected but lived to serve only a little over eight months of his term.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Harrison served only a portion of his term as reporter of the state supreme court. He
                    resigned to enter the army, rising to the rank of brigadier-general. In 1876 he became the
                    Republican candidate for governor after Godlove S. Orth, the regular nominee of the Republican state
                    convention had withdrawn from the ticket. He was defeated by a substantial majority by James D.
                    Williams, better known as "Blue Jeans," a sturdy, honest <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> county farmer. In 1880 the Republicans won a majority in the Legislature and Harrison
                    was elected to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate, succeeding Joseph E. McDonald. He served one term in the senate without winning
                    any particular distinction. In 1888 he was nominated and elected to the presidency, defeating Grover
                    Cleveland. His presidential term was creditable but not marked by any great or outstanding service.
                    He was defeated for reelection in 1892 by his predecessor and competitor of 1888, <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-031-4-016"/> Grover Cleveland. Harrison's greatest fame was won after his
                    retirement from the presidency, when he again took up the legal profession. He was employed in a
                    number of notable cases.</p>
            <p>Michael C. Kerr served in the state Legislature previous to his candidacy for reporter of the supreme
                    court and made an excellent record in that body. In 1866 he was elected to the national House and
                    re-elected in both 1868 and 1870. After an absence of two years from that body he was again elected
                    in 1874. That year the Democrats obtained a majority in the House, and when the forty-fourth
                    Congress convened, Kerr was elected to the Speakership, succeeding James C. Blaine. During his
                    career in Congress, Kerr was a tireless worker and became known as one of the most substantial
                    members of that body. There is no doubt that he would have risen still higher, for he had the full
                    confidence of the people whom he served, had not death cut short his promising career before the
                    expiration of the term for which he had been elected to preside over the House. It is a rather
                    singular coincidence that only a short time before Vice-President Henry Wilson had died, thus the
                    presiding officers of both branches of Congress were removed by the hand of death in the same
                    session. Though not so well known as Morton, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hendricks</region>
                    </placeName> or Harrison, the name of Michael C. Kerr will always have a conspicuous place among
                    those of Indiana's strongest men.</p>
            <p>David Turpie, after his brief term in the Senate in the early part of 1863, resumed the practice of
                    law, in the course of time becoming recognized as one of Indiana's greatest legal lights.
                    In 1864 and again in 1866 he was nominated by the Democrats of his district for congress but was
                    defeated each time, his competitor being Schuyler Colfax, afterwards Vice-President. In 1876 he was
                    elected a member of the state Legislature and chosen speaker of the house. In 1884 he was a
                    candidate for the nomination for governor in the Democratic state convention, but Col. Isaac P.
                    Gray, was nominated, a man who, in the judgment of the writer, was greatly his inferior. In 1887 the
                    legislature elected him to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate, where he served two full terms, retiring March 4, 1899, to be succeeded by
                    Albert J. Beveridge. Senator Turpie was one of the most scholarly man who ever represented Indiana
                    in the upper house of Congress. During the entire <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-031-4-017"/> twelve years
                    of his service, he enjoyed the full confidence and esteem of his colleagues in that body. After his
                    retirement, he wrote a volume of reminiscences, under the modest title, <hi rend="i">Sketches of My
                        Own Times</hi>, which is among the classics in autobiographical literature. On account of this
                    reminiscence, he will probably be remembered longer than for his public service, honorable though
                    that was.</p>
            <p>While each of the six leaders—Lane, Morton, Hendricks, Harrison, Kerr and
                    Turpie—has a high place in Indiana's history, the two outstanding figures among
                    them were Morton and Hendricks. Both were born leaders of men. Each one found a place among the
                    strong men of his party at an early age and each one retained leadership until death. Their
                    characteristic methods differed widely and many and fierce were the battles which they fought on
                    Hoosier soil. The leadership of these great rivals has never been better described than in the words
                    of Congressman William D. Owen in his memorial address in the House of Representatives shortly after
                    the death of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hendricks</region>
                    </placeName>: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Two more diverse spirits never battled in government before: Morton and
                            Hendricks—Sir Richard and Sir Launcelot, the lion hearted warrior and the fair
                            knight. The one spoke to men with the majesty of an autocrat: the other talked to men as a
                            man with his fellows. The one always commanded, the other always pleaded. The one brooked no
                            dissent in his followers; the other let his train camp wide apart. The one, like Caesar,
                            would burn eight hundred villages, bathe his sword in a million lives, and wade through
                            blood to preserve the cause he championed; the other, Coriolanus-like, seeing the carnage,
                            the desolation, the anguish, would sheathe his sword and turn away. The one could seize the
                            helm when the nation was strained in every fiber; the other might take direction when peace
                            hath her victories. They lie within speaking distance. The vast energies of the one are
                            hushed; the broad powers of the other are pulseless. They have grounded arms and rest well
                            in immortal renown.</p>

            <p>If we pause a moment to recall the long list of poets, writers, musicians, sculptors and painters
                    that Indiana has produced, it is easy to realize that there has been for many years something
                    friendly to the creative arts in the Hoosier land.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to know that all of the original Hoosier group of painters, composed of Theodore C.
                    Steele, J. Otis Adams, William Forsyth, Otto Stark, Richard Gruelle, as well as John Bundy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were still living in 1908, at the time <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County became a noted painting ground. This group, which added so much to the culture
                    of Indiana, had for years won the admiration and respect of those of the art world who knew their
                    work. While all great art springs from the soil, it cannot blossom fully without the sunshine coming
                    from a sympathetic and understanding public. Most of these pioneers were well trained artists and it
                    was an honest, heroic and unusual experiment at that time for these men to come from schools of art
                    to paint the country and people they knew, rather than allow themselves to drift to the few large
                    cities which then furnished nearly all the art appreciation which existed.</p>
            <p>These artists composed in all probability the first real group of distinctive character in the entire
                    central portion of our country and paralleled the contemporary literary movement in Indiana. The
                    members received, especially at first, but little appreciation, and there were many trials for them
                    to surmount in order to make a living and continue their work at all. Fortunately for succeeding
                    generations they did a great deal of teaching, which was their legacy to their state as were also
                    their paintings—all honor to these men! One by one these pioneers of art have passed away
                    until not one remains alive today.</p>
            <p>It has been felt by many that the full blossoming of this group occurred when Mr. Steele came into
                    the hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County to live and to put on canvass his interpretations of the country he loved so
                    well. He once made the statement that he considered the opalescent atmosphere among the hills of
                    southern Indiana of sufficient distinctive character and beauty <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-031-4-019"/>
                    to nurture a great school of art. Although he was the only one of the original Hoosier Group to
                    paint in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County, yet a very large portion of the finest painting of this group was done in the
                    southern part of the State. Working in this section it is but natural that the present <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County Colony should carry on the best traditions of the older group.</p>
            <p>The beautiful hill region of southern Indiana covers a vast area. There are other portions of this
                    part of the state which are no doubt quite as lovely and paintable as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County but none situated so close to the largest city of the state and the great
                    metropolis to the north, which, with other populous centers, now sends so many pilgrims to the
                    unique and widely known Art Colony of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County.</p>
            <p>The first connection of art with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County is a little far-fetched, but interesting. William Merritt Chase, one of the most
                    famous painters and teachers of his day, was born south of Williamsburg (now Nineveh) in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>
                    </placeName> County. His birthplace is near the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County line in Nineveh Township. The first artist to sketch in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County was undoubtedly William McKendree Snyder, born at Liberty, Indiana. Mr. Snyder
                    for many years lived and painted in the vicinity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he died. He was a pupil of Eaton, Inness, and Bierstadt. Though one of the older
                    type of painters, he had the true art spirit. From 1870 to 1872 he was associated with his brother,
                    a photographer in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and during those years made several excursions into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County and was much inspired by its scenery. One one of these trips he took with him
                    Peter Fishe Reed, the poet-painter and art critic whom he had met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In October, 1891, Fred Hetherington and Charles Nicoli, art students from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, spent several days sketching, photographing, and exploring in the County, coming in by
                    the way of Morgantown. There are rumors that other students penetrated the County on
                    "hikes" from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These rumors are no doubt true, but none has been verified, nor has the writer been
                    able to learn that anyone ever did any real work in the County, other than possibly a little
                    sketching, prior to 1907.</p>
            <p>I was one of a small group of artists working in Delavan, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. This city was in a lovely and picturesque country. The dairy interests in that state,
                    however, grew to such <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-031-4-020"/> dimensions that the cows literally ate up
                    the landscape, practically ruining the region as a permanent location for art work. It became
                    necessary for this <hi rend="i">group of artists to search</hi> for a new environment. They wished
                    to locate in the most ideal sketching ground to be found in the Central States, as near to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> as possible.</p>
            <p>Soon after this search began a short article appeared in a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> paper, telling of the hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana—of the people, the cabin life and the beauties of the
                    landscape. Taking a hint from this article, in August of 1900, I undertook a horse and buggy trip
                    through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County, starting from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and spending several days on a tour of investigation. Never before had I been so
                    thrilled by a region; it seemed like a fairyland with its narrow winding roads leading the traveler
                    down into the creek beds, through the water pools and up over the hills. Everywhere there were rail
                    fences almost hidden by Queen Anne's lace, goldenrod and other interesting weeds and
                    bushes. Picturesque cabins here and there seemed to belong to the landscape as did the people who
                    lived in them. I was much impressed by the beautiful and dignified growth of the timber. All this
                    country was enveloped in a soft, opalescent haze. A sense of peace and loveliness never before
                    experienced came over me and I felt that at last that I had found the ideal sketching ground. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County at this time was quite inaccessible. On this trip I heard much talk of a
                    proposed rail road, which was constructed several years later. What most concerned me was that I
                    found no hotel to which I could bring my family.</p>
            <p>After learning that the railroad had been built through a corner of the county, I told a number of my <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> artist friends about this region, and, in March, 1907, Louis O. Griffith, Wilson Irvine
                    and Harry L. Engle came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> for two weeks sketching. They were delighted with the scenery and the people.</p>
            <p>In June, 1907, I started from Martinsville with a friend on a two weeks'
                    "hiking" trip of exploration through southern Indiana. One of the principal
                    objects of this journey was to find a desirable place somewhere among the Hoosier hills to which I
                    could bring my family and our Delevan group of artists. On the way through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County a stop was made at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Bill Pittman and Mandy, his good wife, had <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-031-4-021"/>
                    recently taken over the Sanatorium Hotel and they made their two visitors feel very much at home,
                    with their glad hand, good cheer, wholesome food and clean beds. Continuing the zigzag route nearly
                    to the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> the return was made over other roads to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to see the hotel once more. While in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mr. Pittman reported that "Artist Steele" was building a home on the
                    top of a large hill near the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> County line. Going to the hill, Mr. Steele, whom I had previously met, was found
                    sitting on a pile of lumber directing the construction of the first unit of what was to be
                    "The House of the Singing Winds" so well known.</p>
            <p>In May, 1908, I brought my family to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the meantime others had been told about <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County and they spread the news of the picturesque region and the hotel. The year 1908
                    marked the first of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County as a famous sketching ground. That season there were about twenty-five artists
                    painting in the County, probably at the time as strong a group of its kind as had ever gathered in a
                    like place in the states of Middle West. Perhaps, the same may be said of the group each year since
                    then. The numbers have increased until there have been in some seasons from fifty to sixty artists
                    working there. The work conceived and done in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County has undoubtedly been the dominant note in the exhibitions in the central states
                    for all these years and a great force in the maintenance of sanity in art in this part of our
                    country during the confusion of late years.</p>
            <p>Mr. Theodore C. Steele, A.N.A., as stated above, was the first one of the group to settle in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County. He purchased a large tract of land ten miles west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1907. He wished to have a home and studio amid the beautiful hills where he could
                    best pursue his work in the peace and quiet he desired. For a number of years his place was quite
                    inaccessible on account of the distance from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the condition of the roads and we saw but little of him. He expressed regret that
                    he was not living nearer <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> so that he could associate more closely with his fellow painters. There was probably no
                    artist in the entire central area who was more loved and respected by all the artists both for his
                    work and as a man and friend. Mr. Steele always took an interest in the activity of the group as
                    long as he lived. He was our most distinguished member, the dean of Indiana artists, and <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-031-4-022"/> the only connecting link with the older Hoosier group of painters and
                    the colony in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County group, as now, has always centered in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I believe that Bill and Mandy Pittman had more to do with the beginning and
                    continuance of art in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County than any other single influence. For years they kept the picturesque, cheerful
                    hotel at a price within the reach of the average artist, till the Colony was established, widely
                    known, and the members had begun to build their homes. Had it not been for such a hotel in the
                    community, it is quite likely that the Colony might have located in some other part of the great
                    hill district of southern Indiana.</p>
            <p>The Pittmans were natives of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County. The early visitors to the Colony will always carry with them tender memories of
                    these good people who cared for them so well during the years when the hotel was the meeting place
                    for them all. They were continually doing or suggesting interesting things for the artists, even to
                    the extent of having the village brass band on the balcony of the hotel to welcome the arrival of
                    one of the early members of the group. For years, a sign done in 1908 portraying rotund Bill (front
                    and rear) painted by John Hafen, Adam Emory Albright and myself, swung in front of the hotel.</p>
            <p>I happened to be one of the first at the inception of the colony. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> were in the nature of discoveries to me as I had never known anyone who had been there
                    before. I located there because I believed it furnished the most beautiful and paintable scenes I
                    had ever known. I wished to continue my life work in such a congenial atmosphere and harmonious
                    surroundings. There, too, Mrs. Ada Walter Shulz could paint her mothers and children at their best.
                    One could hardly have dreamed of a large colony and I was somewhat surprised at the number who came
                    the first year (1908).</p>
            <p>For several years nearly all the artists who came were from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and mostly my friends and acquaintances. Among the first were Frank K. Phoenix, Mrs.
                    Ada Walter Shulz, and myself of the Delavan (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>) group. Louis O. Griffith, Wilson Irvine, Harry L. Engle, Adam Emory Albright, the
                    painter of children, Rudolph Ingerlo, and Karl Krafft were among those who joined the Colony, and
                    there <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-031-4-023"/> were a number of others all of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. John Hafen, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a fellow student in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, came East in 1908 to exhibit in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to renew our old friendship and paint in company with me that season. He remained a

                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County painter till he passed away in 1910. J. W. Vawter and Mary Murray Vawter came in
                    August, 1908.</p>
            <p>Some of the first to arrive are still with us and others coming later have since established
                    themselves and have secured homes. Still others have been coming year after year to the hotels and
                    boarding houses. Those who live at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> at this time are: Louis O. Griffith, Carl Graf, Marie Goth, J. W. Vawter, V. J.

                    Shulz (the writer), and Anthony Buchta.</p>
            <p>Among others who have been closely associated with the colony are: Lucie Hartrath, Homer Davisson,
                    Rudolph Ingerle, Leota Loop, Oscar Erickson, Alexis J. Fourmier, Charles Dahlgreen, Thomas Lockie,

            <p>The following members of the group have gone over the sunset hill to the West: John Hafen, 1910;
                    Theodore C. Steele, 1926; Frederick Nelson Vance, 1926; Ada Walter Shulz, 1928; Paul Randall, 1933.</p>
            <p>It would be impossible to enumerate all the different artists who have painted in <placeName>

                    </placeName> County from time to time. This Colony of workers has grown in a natural manner without
                    exploitation or the presence in its midst of an art school. As the fame of the colony increased,
                    visitors in great numbers began to come to the studios and it became apparent that the artists would
                    soon have to establish art galleries for the mutual benefit of the artists and the public, showing
                    the work of the entire group. This need was mentioned one evening in the presence of Mr. J. A. Linke
                    and B. W. Stoddard and they volunteered to raise the necessary money required <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-031-4-024"/> to build the galleries. In a few days, with the aid of Frederick W.
                    Poliey and Mrs. Musette O. Stoddard, a substantial amount was secured and deposited in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank, and more promised. The time was not ripe, however, and the idea of the galleries
                    was postponed and the money refunded.</p>
            <p>In September, 1926, largely through the plans of Carl Graf, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County Art Galleries Association was founded and Mr. Graf was made the President.
                    Public exhibitions were made possible by Mr. William M. Wilkes, a good friend of the artists, who
                    remodelled some store buildings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> for their use. For several years Mr. Wilkes operated an art store in an adjoining room
                    and was the manager of the galleries. These galleries have been opened each year since, from about
                    April tenth to November twentieth. Exhibitions are changed three times each season. At first the
                    experiment was tried of maintaining the galleries entirely by dues of artist members and the
                    voluntary help of friends, keeping the exhibitions free to the public. This could not continue and
                    in July, 1932, it was found necessary to charge a small admission fee of ten cents on certain days
                    each week, which plan has enabled the Association to carry on.</p>
            <p>The attendance and interest on the part of the public have steadily increased. During 1934 over nine
                    thousand people visited the galleries, a fact which encouraged the Association to take over the
                    entire building. In April, 1935, the season started with the gallery capacity nearly doubled. The
                    Association cherishes a plan to build, eventually, its own galleries, with proper lighting and an
                    adequate parking place. In that event, without the necessity of the payment of rents, a permanent
                    collection of outstanding Hoosier art can gradually be acquired. It is planned to have this
                    collection include a memorial gallery of work by departed members. This collection has already been
                    started and several additional important works have been promised. Numerous exhibitions of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County paintings, both by individuals and groups, have been sent over Indiana and other
                    states. The demand for exhibitions is always greater than can be supplied. The Frederick Nelson
                    Vance memorial prize of $50.00, a bequest of Mrs. Josephine Vance, the artist's
                    mother, is awarded each year on August ninth, the birthday of Mr. Vance.</p>

            <p>The members of this group of talented and well known artists have all been attracted to <placeName>

                    </placeName> County by the same things—the Hoosier hills, the Hoosier people, the Hoosier
                    spirit, the beautiful opalescent atmosphere and the quiet picturesque surroundings where the artists
                    can live their normal lives and pursue their life work, each in his own individual way. They have
                    been living together for a long time as neighbors in a small community and while there has always
                    been a fine spirit of helpfulness and cooperation among them, no two artists paint alike nor do they
                    see much of each other's work till it is exhibited. They love their neighbors, the sturdy,
                    picturesque and kindly folk of the hills, and have entered with interest into their lives.</p>
            <p>Nearly all the great art of the past has been racial, regional or national in character. As a liberty
                    loving people we are growing weary of an art degraded by foreign influence. If we are to expect an
                    art indigenous to our soil, telling the story, depicting the scene, or expressing the beauty, spirit
                    and aspiration of America, there can be no doubt that it must come from just such groups of workers
                    located here and there in those parts of the country farthest removed from foreign influence as is
                    the <placeName>

                    souls through the wilderness of forests, Indians, and wild animals. The pioneers of this advance
                    guard came mostly from the growing state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    </placeName> in 1792. The movement was given fresh stimulus by the Indian treaties of 1804 and the

                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> County lands in 1804–1805, which were followed by the opening of the federal

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These steps in the opening of the territory offered a definite and two-fold promise of
                    protection to prospective immigrants. By the treaties mentioned, all lands in Indiana Territory

                    enjoyed by Kentucky landholders.</p>
            <p>During the years from 1807 to 1810, there was a lull in the westward movement, and few permanent
                    settlers arrived. Fresh Indian hostilities due to new boundary disagreements between the Indians and
                    Governor Harrison, made the Trace almost impassable. Some who attempted to reach <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>

            <p>In the year 1811, however, activity was renewed on the Trace, and there began an influx of immigrants
                    of a little different type from many of the early ones. Few of these were purely seekers of
                    adventure, nor did they expect to accept the wilderness as it was. Land ownership, permanent homes,
                    the cultivation of the soil, and the transplanting of the religious and social customs of their
                    native states (mostly <placeName>

                    Possibly he was the community's first land speculator.</p>
            <p>In the year 1808 patents were granted for two tracts of land important to this study. The first was
                    that of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> Oak Springs quarter-section (the Northeast Quarter of Section 28) to Woolsey Pride, and
                    the second was the quarter section which was to become the site of Petersburg. This was the
                    Northeast Quarter of Section 27, granted to Silas Risley. The original claimant assigned his claim
                    to this quarter section to Peter Brenton, about 1812, who in turn donated it for the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike</region>
                    </placeName> County in 1817.</p>
            <p>Between 1808 and 1816 about forty land patents were issued and recorded in (Congressional) Township 1
                    North, Range 8 West. The names of James and Henry Brenton appear among the purchasers, and the names

                    Miley, and Henry Miley Jr.</p>
            <p>Land records are unreliable, however, for the purpose of establishing the actual citizenry of any
                    given place in that period, inasmuch as it was not uncommon procedure for the settler to squat upon
                    the land of his choice and take no legal steps to establish his claim until forced by competition to
                    do so. It is therefore doubtless true that some of the settlers who acquired title to their lands as
                    late as 1814 and 1816 had actually lived upon them for a number of years.</p>

                    that it is an almost complete roster of the families whose common interests centered immediately
                    about Woolsey Pride's fort. It has its omissions, but none of them is a serious drawback to
                    the reconstruction of the community, inasmuch as every family represented on it is also represented
                    on other records. It is difficult to understand the failure to sign it of Paul Tislow, young George
                    Coonrod, and the two Henry Mileys, father and son. The presence of Jeremiah Arnold's name
                    is, on the other hand, puzzling. He did not at that time nor later <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-031-4-032"/> own land in Township 1 North, Range 8 West.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Both

                    section held or claimed by one or the other of these.</p>
            <p>Based, therefore, upon research to date, the authors of this paper submit the names of Pride, Risley,

            <p>It is entirely fitting that Woolsey Pride's name should head the list of signers of the <placeName>

                    Pride, who is supposed to have been his brother. This is without question the same Thomas who
                    married Caty Miley in 1809, who registered his first land claim to the Northeast Quarter of Section
                    18, Township 1 North, Range 6 West (in the present <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>

                    widow: Henry Pride, Woolsey Pride, Thomas G. Pride, Joel Strong, Permenes Palmer, William Rhodarmel,
                    and the heirs of William Russel and E. G. Hayes. (The authors interpret the three heirs named Pride
                    to be the sons of Thomas, the heirs of William Russell and E. G. Hayes to be grandchildren, and the
                    other three mentioned, either grandchildren or the husbands of deceased daughters.) It is impossible
                    to read the life of Woolsey Pride from the records as it is that of Thomas for two reasons. First,
                    there are records missing (his estate papers, and others), and second, the records available may
                    refer to the Woolsey Pride who was his nephew, or to a son, Woolsey Pride, Jr.</p>
            <p>The following names upon early marriage records indicate that Woolsey Pride either had a large family
                    of his own, or that he was well favored by the presence in the neighborhood of his sisters and his
                    cousins and his aunts:</p>

            <p>It appears that the Colemans were members of a large Virginia family of that name who came into

            <p>A fascinating subject for speculation, and perhaps a departure point for further research, is to be

                    name in the community and there is scarcely ground for speculation concerning him. Neither in his
                    case nor that of Thomas Walker did the authors of this study locate descendents, or learn of family

            <p>It is pleasant to turn from speculation in regard to such unknowns as Thomas Walker and Jacob
                    Schearmahon to the consideration of a man whose cycle of vital statistics is so nearly complete as
                    that of Jeremiah Arnold. As step-son, as husband, as father, and as ancestor, there is a great deal
                    of satisfying evidence relating to the twelfth signer of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> Oak Springs Road petition. His name has been generously distributed among a large
                    number of his descendants living in and near Petersburg, and it lives, moreover, in the institutions
                    which have grown up in the immediate neighborhood of his homestead.</p>
            <p>Jeremiah Arnold was the "dearly beloved" step-son of Bryant Savarns, so-called in
                    his step-father's will, and named by him to be administrator of his estate, in preference
                    to sons of his own.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> As previously explained in the general discussion of the

                    </placeName> Oak Springs Road petition, it was Bryant Savarns who had entered land in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Oak Springs community, and not Jeremiah Arnold.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> But it was
                    Jeremiah Arnold who put his name to the historic document, who married into the community, and who
                    left sons and daughters to continue his name from that day to the present.</p>
            <p>It was not until 1818 that Jeremiah Arnold was granted a patent to the farm which became his
                    permanent homestead. This was the Northeast Quarter of Section 8, Township 1 North, Range 7 West, on
                    the Buffalo Trace about seven miles east of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> Oak Springs. On this farm, he and his wife, the Barbary Coonrod to whom he had been
                    married by Squire Henry Brenton in 1809, and their growing family, lived out the remaining twenty
                    years of his lifetime.</p>

            <p>In a will prepared with evident anxiety to do the right and generous thing by all his heirs, Jeremiah
                    Arnold left to his "beloved Barbary" all his property and money and a life

                    furnished with a horse, and each daughter, on the same condition, $20. After the death of
                    his widow, "the remains of his substance" should be equally divided among the
                    surviving children.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

                    Arnold neighborhood, attended the Arnold School and the Arnold Church, and have been buried in the
                    Arnold Graveyard.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>The simple history of Jeremiah Arnold is in sharp contrast to the ramifications with which the
                    Brenton family history is complicated. Evidence from public records points to the conclusion that
                    the Brenton name owes its continuance in the community of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>

                    </placeName> Oak Springs Road petition. The fourth Brenton whose name appeared on the petition,
                    Peter, son of James, is one who has acquired more fame than that of all the others put together, due
                    to the perpetuation of his name in <hi rend="i">Petersburg.</hi> There were also two others by the
                    name who were residents of the community or thereabouts: William, who left an estate but no heirs at
                    his death in 1815; and James A., an old man when he died in 1842 without property and without heirs.

                    already bristling with difficulties of "Which Robert?" and "Which

                    that some such differentiation had been made in the early generations as became necessary in later

            <p>But to return to the Brentons of Indiana—the James and Henry and Robert who fathered the
                    generations of Petersburg. The evidence suggests that James (1764–1836) was the patriarch
                    of the family. His military record closed in 1782,<hi rend="sup">48</hi> indicating that he was
                    content to let Henry and Peter and others uphold the family honor when Governor Harrison was
                    recruiting rangers in 1807 and thenceforward. At this time (1807) James Brenton was forty-three
                    years old, the father of a family of grown and half grown children, and a veteran of the War for
                    Independence. What wonder that he was willing to let the young blades do the Indian fighting while
                    he attended to his manifold personal duties in the new settlement?</p>
            <p>There is a very significant piece of evidence, however, which indicates that James Brenton was by no
                    means completely engrossed in his own affairs, but that on the contrary, he was giving of his time
                    and talents to affairs of public interest and importance. It reveals him, moreover, as a man of
                    intelligence and education, a student of civil law and political philosophy, and a constructive
                    critic of the territorial government and legislation.</p>

                    By methods explained in this news item, James Brenton was undoubtedly making a valuable contribution

                    actively engaged in Indian fighting. That his type was all too infrequent is borne out by the
                    political blunderings of the period.</p>
            <p>James Brenton's family, children of his first wife, Catherine, who signed his deeds as late
                    as 1818, included Peter and Henry (called Henry, Jr.), Polly and Charity, and a third daughter whose
                    name has eluded the writers. Henry died in 1822, as already mentioned, leaving a widow, the former
                    Elizabeth Coonrod, and four children, John, Robert, Katherine, and William Henry. Polly married
                    Jonathan Walker in 1811, Charity married James Harris in 1818, and the third daughter who preceded
                    her father in death, married Jacob Harbison,<hi rend="sup">51</hi> In 1830 James Brenton remarried,

                    left a complete and detailed will relating to the division and disposition of his lands and personal
                    property to his five children, four of whom were girls.</p>
            <p>In addition to the widow, Polly (who remarried in 1825 before the settlement of his estate), Henry
                    Brenton's heirs were his eldest daughter, Patsey, the wife of John Borders; Betsey, who
                    married William Beck in 1825; Polly, who married James Fowler in 1824; Sary, a minor child for whom
                    John Borders was appointed guardian and who later married Hugh Shaw; and Henry, his only son, who
                    was named executor of his estate.</p>
            <p>It is at this point in the Brenton history that the authors of this study have been utterly
                    confounded by the many Henrys. Three marriage licenses issued to Henry Brentons between 1816 and
                        1820;<hi rend="sup">54</hi> the use of the title Jr. by Henry, son of James, rather than by
                    Henry, son of Henry (though perhaps also by the latter); the possible presence in the county, as
                    mentioned above, of a third Henry, distantly related, or unrelated, to whom records might
                    refer—these are a few pieces of the jig-saw puzzle of the Brenton genealogy. Until
                    further facts are discovered which fit with these, the puzzle can not be solved.</p>
            <p>Concerning Robert Brenton, the third of the Brenton family heads to be treated here, there appears to
                    be a singular lack of information. He died in 1842, leaving nine children to inherit his lands and
                    other property. Although five of these were boys, Peter, William, John, Kursey and Robert
                    (remarkable to note, no Henry), the writers have not located any Brentons of the present generation
                    who trace their ancestry to them. One daughter, Pamela, married Job Chappell, and another daughter,
                    Milly, married William Coleman. Two other daughters, Katherine and Narcissa, were still unmarried at
                    the time of their father's death. All other records, besides that of the probate record

            <p>The authors should perhaps acknowledge the answer, or part-answer, which the Robert Brenton family
                    made to their prayer for imaginative names. Kursey, Narcissa, and Pamela, have a strange and
                    charming ring in the midst of the Henrys, Pollys, Charitys, and Betsys. Still stranger, but less
                    romantic was the name which came into the family by the marriage of Robert Brenton's son
                    John. The authors of this study could not believe their eyes when they saw it first upon the
                    marriage record, John Brenton to Degeneracy Caldwell. Its reappearance upon later deeds and other
                    records, however, dispelled their doubts. For homely and unconventional names, the writers nominate
                    this name <hi rend="i">Degeneracy</hi> for the blue ribbon, the brown derby, or what have you in the
                    way of first prizes.</p>
            <p>Peter Brenton, the eldest son of James Brenton, is the only member of the second generation of the
                    family who signed his name to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> Oak Springs Road petition. It seems that Peter Brenton had that happy faculty of being
                    in the midst of community activities. By virtue of this, and particularly of his part in the land
                    transaction which gave his name to Petersburg, he has seemed to collect most of the honors of the
                    family to himself. With but two exceptions, the members of the family interviewed in the preparation
                    of this paper all claimed descent from him. That some of them are in error as to their true ancestry
                    seems sure, inasmuch as James left one other male heir besides Peter, Henry one, and Robert, five.
                    Without proof to the contrary, it seems inevitable that a number of the present generation are
                    descended from other Brentons and not from Peter.</p>

            <p>This account of Peter Brenton closes the very sketchy and incomplete history of the Brentons during

                        <region type="county">White</region>

                    Petersburg from that day to this. Many still cling to the soil for their living, but others are
                    engaged in all the trades, professions, and business callings that the town and country demands.
                    They have become such a highly diversified and versatile group that it is difficult to think of them
                    as a family, or to discover among them common family traits. Yet there is noticeable among great
                    numbers of them a lively interest in current history and public affairs which may very well be a
                    heritage from the gentlemen who signed the <placeName>

                    contemporary of James, Henry, and Robert Brenton. There are two schools of thought among the Mileys
                    as to the former location of their migrating ancestor. One branch holds that he came from <placeName>

                    </placeName> Oak Springs Road petition of 1810, and the marriage record of Betsy Miley to George
                    Coonrod, and that of Caty Miley to Thomas Pride (1809), seem to be the earliest documentary notice
                    of the family's presence at <placeName>

                    </placeName> Oak Springs.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Although there is a strong tradition that they
                    arrived about 1803, the name is noticeably absent from territorial court and military records. The
                    family was a large one, and at least four of the children were grown by about 1810. Henry Miley,
                    Sr., lived until 1847, having seen his neighbors, John Coonrod, James and Henry Brenton, Jeremiah
                    Arnold and Woolsey Pride, two of his sons, Henry and William, and two of his daughters, Catherine
                    (Caty) and Elizabeth, go to their graves. The unnumbered children of the four last mentioned
                    deceased sons and daughters shared in the estate at the death of Henry Miley, along with his own
                    living children, Mary Harrell, Sarah Davenport, Nancy Griffith, David, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin</region>
                    </placeName>, and George. Peter also survived, but did not share in the estate, having already had
                    his part. David as executor was able to allot the heirs $16 each, besides a portion of
                    land, a very respectable inheritance in those days, and especially so, considering the large number
                    of the heirs.</p>
            <p>David Miley seems to have been the most able of his father's children. At least, as he gave
                    most of his life to public service, he left the most complete record of his capacities. He was a
                    wheelwright by trade, but a public officer by election, serving <placeName>

                    </placeName> County in all of its elective offices. He had more education than was common in his
                    day, and one is tempted to speculate upon the possibility of his having had educational
                    opportunities in a previous home, <placeName>

                    bore him three children, Mary, Newton, and Deborah, and second to the "Widow
                    Finn," who before her first marriage was Sarah Osbourne.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>The Miley family have been and still are prolific contributors to the population of Petersburg. They
                    are distinguished by versatility and talent. A comparatively small number now bear the name Miley,
                    but the descendants who have inherited the blood from the distaff side are numerous, and they have
                    made a notable contribution to the cultural and artistic life of the community.</p>

                    activity were behind him. His descendants know little of the personality of the man, but his choice
                    of a whole section of the very finest river bottom farming land (Section 22) indicates, no doubt,
                    something of his <placeName>

                    been provided for, shared in the inheritance of his estate. They were George, Henry, Daniel, Mary
                    Barbara and Elizabeth. Three of these children, and possibly others, of whom the records have not
                    been discovered, married into the families of <placeName>

                    to Henry Brenton, son of James Brenton.</p>
            <p>The oldest son, George (d. 1849), whose name was upon the <placeName>

                    fourteen years. He also outlived his wife Betsy, though she lived long enough to bear him fourteen
                    children. Thirteen of them lived to share in their father's estate at his death, and the
                    deceased daughter left four children who also shared. The names and ages of the heirs of George
                    Coonrod were as follows: Sarah (Woods), 30; George W., 28; Lewis, 26; Rebecca, 23; Delilah, 21;

                    12; and Sally Ann, Absolom, Malissa, and Mary Jane Harbison, aged respectively, 11, 8, 5, and 3. The
                    last four were children of a daughter who married a Harbison.</p>

            <p>The Conrad (Coonrod) family is now represented in Petersburg by a very few of its members, but this
                    is a very recent condition. Until the last few years, there were great numbers of them. Few of these
                    carried on the agricultural tradition of their ancestor, however. The modern generation have
                    succumbed to the attractions of business and industry, many of their members having sought
                    opportunities in larger cities. At least five families of one branch have emigrated to <placeName>

            <p>The Tislow family alone remains to be discussed of all those who may be called the First Families of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Oak Springs. This postponement may seem particularly fitting to certain descendants of
                    Paul Tislow, if they bear in mind the prophecy that the first shall be last. This reference is to
                    the strong but unsubstantiated tradition among them that Paul Tislow was the first permanent settler
                    in the community which was to become <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> Oak Springs. According to his grandson, Mr. Tom Tislow, of Petersburg, the following
                    statement is correct: "Paul Tislow came from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> in 1776, starting the day before he was twenty-one in order to evade military service
                    in the German army. He settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, lived there two or three years, and married his employer's daughter, Matilda
                    Nay. He came with her to Indiana in 1778 or 1779 with one horse and sled, and built a fortified
                    cabin in what is now <placeName>

                    Tislow served a military enlistment, as one of his deeds reads, "a grant for military
                    service." Naturally they like to think that this was Revolutionary War service. But his
                    name is on none of the rolls of the pension department, nor is it in the adjutant's office,
                    or on the records of Indiana Territory as a member of territorial troops. Though he may have been,
                    as his descendants believe, the first settler of <placeName>

                    Paul Tislow could recover damages from the defendant.</p>
            <p>This piece of legal business seems to the authors of this study to indicate a very strong probability
                    that Paul Tislow had established his residence in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> previous to coming to Indiana. It also suggests the possibility that, despite

                    both) rather than having preceded them by a decade or two.</p>
            <p>Whatever the time of his coming, the fact remains that his presence was established by 1806, and that
                    from that time on his name (sometimes spelled Tisselow and again Tysloe) was a steadily recurring
                    one on the records of the <placeName>

                    "GEORGIUS II. DEI. GRATIA." On the reverse, around the outer rim of the circle,
                    are the words: "LET US LOOK TO THE MOST HIGH WHO BLESSED OUR FATHERS WITH PEACE."

            <p>The date of this Peace Medal was during the war between the French and English. Great destruction had
                    been wrought and many atrocities committed upon the British colonists. There was evident a general
                    hope that the war would soon end as it did in America in 1760, and also that peace should be made
                    with the Indians. To these ends the English Government and the colonists began to plan.</p>

            <p>The poll tax is a per capita tax, generally levied uniformly upon males. It may be, however, graded
                    according to occupation or other qualifications. In ancient <placeName>
                        <country reg="gr">Greece</country>
                    </placeName>, the poll-tax was a badge of slavery; levied upon captives, regardless of their duties
                    to their captors; but the Romans placed this burden of taxation only upon the inhabitants of their
                    colonial possessions; Moslem rulers found it a very effective method of wresting moneys from
                    unbelievers, and the Mongols collected a tax on polls from the Russians.</p>
            <p>The majority of European countries have now discontinued the use of the poll-tax at home, but
                    continue it in their possessions. A flat-rate tax was first levied in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in 1377, was graded according to rank in 1379, and appeared at intervals in that form
                    through 1698. In <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, the "capitation" levy of 1695, radically altered in 1701,
                    established twenty classes, with rates from twenty sous to two thousand livres. Peter the Great
                    established a poll-tax in Russia in 1718, with three groups of tax-payers. This act was modified and
                    then abolished in 1886. The Prussians started a simple system of collecting poll-taxes in 1811,
                    which was succeeded in 1820 by the establishment of a new plan under which those taxed were divided
                    into four groups, with three classes in each group.</p>
            <p>All of the American colonies employed this type of taxation at some period in their existence.

                    statutes. Sometimes it is a distinct tax, sometimes it is associated with property taxes, and
                    sometimes it is merely a local tax. It is used for such purposes as the care of highways, schools,
                    and general state purposes.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The New <placeName>

                    states in the other sections, but it is usually poorly collected. In the constitutions of five
                    states, a poll-tax is forbidden, while it is expressly provided for in seven states. The rates in
                    the various states range from fifty cents to five dollars for each male citizen involved. The age

                    cripples, deaf, dumb, insane, blind, and those in military service, as well as those who have served
                    in some war.</p>
            <p>Some states allow payment by a creditor when the amount is set off against the debtor's
                    account; or by employers, who may take it out of the employee's wages; or property may be
                    attached in order to satisfy the tax. In many states it falls mainly upon those who pay other taxes.
                    When used as a prerequisite to voting, political parties sometimes supply the money to pay

            <p>The laws relative to poll-taxes passed by the Indiana Legislature from 1821 to the present reveal
                    several significant facts. As early as 1821 Indiana used the poll-tax as one source of revenue for
                    state purposes and has so used it ever since. The amount of the tax for state purposes has ranged
                    from thirty-one and a half cents to $1.50. However, the range has been in the main from
                    fifty cents to one dollar on each poll.</p>
            <p>For fifteen years, all males over twenty-one years of age were required to pay the tax, but by 1837,
                    the maximum age limit was placed at fifty years and thus it remains to the present time. The
                    exemptions are very few. Provision was made for excusing veterans of the Revolutionary War, and for
                    the soldiers and sailors in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> service.</p>
            <p>Injured or poverty stricken citizens could be exempted by the Board of Commissioners in any county if
                    the conditions warranted it. Invalids might be exempted after 1849 unless they owned more than three

            <p>Some features of the poll-tax system of Indiana may be of interest. For example, in regard to the

            <p>Following the passage of the three amendments to the Federal Constitution soon after the Civil War,
                    the state of Indiana by legislative enactment passed a law providing for the payment of a poll-tax

            </p>
            <p>With the expanding power of the state, the local units were allowed to levy poll-taxes, a consequence
                    of which is that we have six agencies, namely, civil city, school city, civil township, school
                    township, county, and state, that may levy poll-taxes. Maximum totals have, however, been provided
                    so that the burden of the poll-tax has not been excessive in Indiana. Until recently, a man could
                    work out his road poll-tax by service on roads or streets, but that privilege has passed.</p>
            <p>An act giving any board of county commissioners the power to levy a poll-tax for county purposes was

                    boards had levied such a tax prior to the passage of the act. This law legalized these levies.</p>

            <p>As early as 1821, a tax of fifty cents was placed upon all males over twenty-one years of age, with
                    the provision that Boards of County Commissioners should have the power to exempt any males over
                    sixty years of age who possessed no property. There have been gradual changes through the years,
                    thirty-five acts in all. In 1931, due to the inability of many localities to meet the demands for
                    school purposes out of local taxes, fifty cents from the tax collected on each poll were, for school
                    purposes, distributed by the state to those communities where finances for the schools were low. An
                    Act of 1933 levied a tax of $1.50 upon males between the ages of twenty-one and fifty,
                    one dollar of which was to go to the general state fund, while the remainder was to be used for
                    school purposes as under the act of 1931.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> This is not an exceptionally high

                    poll-tax against the citizens of the state. The court said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It appears to us that exacting taxes from the citizens by the governing power, and the

                            what principle, then, would the citizen be exempt from responding to a demand at any given
                            time for such taxes. The legislative power governs the question of the amount, and the
                            manner in which the citizen shall contribute to the public demands, subject only to

                    One Decker claimed exemption on the ground that his property was mortgaged. It was held that a
                    mortgager, for purposes of taxation, is the owner of the property until the mortgagee shall have
                    taken possession of the same by legal process, and that "A poll tax is a lien upon the real

            <p>Another issue arose in 1876 in the case of Culbertson <hi rend="i">v.</hi> Board. Culbertson went to
                    Europe with his family, planning to remain there for at least two years, but intending to return at
                    some indefinite date. While Culbertson was in Europe, he wrote a letter to his brother in which he
                    said: "They of course will only tax me upon my real estate this year, as I have ceased to
                    be a citizen for a year or two, and as life is uncertain may never become one again." The
                    most important question in the case was whether Culbertson had changed his residence. The Court held
                    that since he left the state only temporarily, and with the intention of returning and resuming his
                    former place of abode, he continued for all purposes to enjoy civil and political activities and to
                    be subject to civil taxation, and therefore liable to pay poll-tax as an inhabitant of the state.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    constitution. The Supreme Court held that the law did not violate the amendment inasmuch as the
                    territorial Legislature had the power to impose a poll-tax for the support of local government on
                    one who enjoyed its protection. Thus it seems to be clearly established by court decisions that all
                    of one's property, is liable for the payment of all taxes.</p>
            <p>Although the legality of the poll-tax was established some six decades ago, not much has been said as
                    to the fairness of it. The principal argument for the poll-tax is that every person ought to be made
                    to appreciate his responsibility to the government under which he lives, and the best method of
                    making him responsible is by some method of personal taxation, such as the poll-tax. The argument is
                    sound in itself, but not in its application to the poll-tax, for it is by no means a personal tax
                    for everyone, but it is limited to males between the ages of twenty-one and fifty, and methods of
                    evasion are numerous. The persons to whom the argument particularly applies rarely pay the tax and
                    persons who pay the tax are already paying other taxes.</p>
            <p>The characteristics of a good tax are: (1) ability to pay; (2) minimum cost of collection; and (3)
                    maximum benefits received. The poll-tax violates at least two of the foregoing principles. It does
                    not take into consideration ability to pay or the benefits received. The amount of revenue which it
                    yields is very small. The per capita revenue derived in 1924 in all the states was only eight cents
                    and only seven per cent of the aggregate taxes for the year.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> An understanding
                    of the tax would undoubtedly bring about some reform, either toward distribution based upon ability
                    to pay, or complete abolition.</p>
            <p>In the past few years, the question of financing the state has become a more difficult and pressing
                    matter. A committee was appointed to study the situation in Indiana and make recommendations. Their
                    findings are in the <hi rend="i">Report of the Indiana Tax Survey Committee to the Seventy-Seventh
                        General Assembly of the State of Indiana.</hi> This was submitted on January 15, 1931. The

                            been required to pay a poll tax. Since the granting of franchise to women to vote, it has
                            been urged that they be required to pay a poll tax. This committee feels there is no logical
                            reason for not imposing a state tax of at least $2.00 on all citizens who enjoy
                            the voting franchise. For that purpose, it has recommended that such a tax be provided, and
                            that some adequate means of enforcing collection be established so that as many as possible
                            may contribute this fixed sum toward the support of the government. There seems to be no
                            good reason why any exception should be made on account of age or for any other reason
                            except poverty.</p>

                    provided that they realize why they are paying the tax. On the other hand, the proportion of taxes
                    derived from the poll tax is so small that it would not make a great deal of difference in the total
                    revenues. Voters should realize the responsibility that rests upon them when they cast their votes,
                    without being reminded of it in such a painful manner. Therein lies the fault of the present
                    educational system; it does not produce incentives toward becoming worthwhile citizens.</p>
            <p>The total amount of taxes collected in Indiana in 1929 was $161,758,400 of which amount
                    $1,394,200 came from the poll-tax. It is possible that if women were required to pay a
                    poll-tax, it would practically double the amount of taxes derived from that source, making the
                    percentage approximately one and seven-tenths instead of the present nine-tenths of one per cent of
                    the total tax.</p>
            <p>A list of eight statements concerning the poll-tax in Indiana was recently mailed to a large number
                    of voters in various sections of the state by the author. The object was to ascertain whether
                    citizens, generally, have any accurate knowledge relative to the poll-tax in Indiana Those
                    responding were asked not to sign their names, but to give age and occupation in each case. Each
                    statement was followed by both <hi rend="i">yes</hi> and <hi rend="i">no</hi>, and each person who
                    filled out the questionaire was asked to check the word which would in his judgment indicate the
                    truth or falsity of the statement. The list follows: 1. All men between the ages of 21 and 60 are
                    required to pay a poll-tax. 2. A poll-tax is a prerequisite to voting. 3. Poll-taxes are levied to
                    defray the expenses of elections. 4. Poll-tax exemptions are granted by the Boards of County <pb n="332" id="VAA4025-031-4-068"/> Commissioners. 5. Poll-tax revenues have practically doubled
                    since the granting of the franchise to women. 6. The state, county, township, and city may each levy
                    a poll-tax. 7. Poll-taxes are collected by County Treasurers. 8. A poll-tax receipt must be shown in
                    order to receive any kind of license.</p>
            <p>There were 2310 voters who returned checked lists of the statements. According to occupation, these
                    were divided as follows: business men, 295; clergymen, 20; farmers, 240; housewives, 275; lawyers,
                    35; physicians, 39; public officials, 59; salesmen, 95; skilled laborers, 196; office-workers, 150;
                    unskilled laborers, 282; unemployed, 65; students, 210; teachers, 327; librarians, 30.</p>
            <p>The results of the questionaire are of interest.</p>

            <p>Two surface precipitations in present discussion of social and economic questions are marked by the
                    tendency to start with the year 1929 and the idea that the complexity of the current situation is so
                    great that analysis and constructive suggestions are impossible. Copyright dates of books assume an
                    undue importance. Whatever the subject under consideration, if the book were copyrighted before
                    1929, the value of the work is immediately and seriously discounted. Facts and ideas judged sound
                    before 1929 are considered obsolete and inapplicable to this post-1929 decade. The post-1929 decade,
                    or the partial decade of the thirties, is thought so chaotic, so complex, so confused as to defy the
                    necessary analysis that constructive suggestion for improvement and advance may be made. The second
                    attitude is the result of the first and the net result of the two combined is mental fear and the
                    paralysis of defeatism or rationalized inertia.</p>
            <p>It is submitted that though there may appear to be some basis for the two attitudes that the result
                    of them is unfortunate, at least in its extremity, that the case is not hopeless. We can do
                    something about the situation. It is further submitted—and this is the <hi rend="i">raison d'etre</hi> of the remarks that follow—that both the two attitudes
                    and the resultant state of mind are to some degree the products of the methods of teaching history
                    in the public schools. Reference is here made to those methods which stress narrative and recall at
                    the expense of interpretation, application, and creativity. Facts are indispensables but they are
                    the materials for <hi rend="i">use</hi> in thought—for interpretation, for application to
                    the present, for use in creating an organized, unified outlook on life. The emphasis should be on
                    ideational not factual history. Facts, may it be repeated, are essentials but the use of them should
                    be centered upon and should insure their social utility not their neglect.</p>
            <p>The decrease in the use and the subordination, if not the abandonment, of the "page to
                    page" textbook assignment, of the distortion of the Socratic method known as the
                    "question-and-answer" method and of other memoriter techniques in favor of topical
                    arrangement was indication of dissatisfaction <pb n="334" id="VAA4025-031-4-070"/> with them. The
                    subsequent favor extended to the "unit" denotes a realization of the importance of
                    relationships. Yet the so-called "units" ordinarily are merely topics or
                    "blocks" of material whose choice is dictated by chronology, class room
                    convenience or some consideration extraneous to the true nature of the subject. An unit in history
                    may even be an organization of related events, thoughts, feelings and/or conditions and yet violate
                    the true nature of the subject. In too many cases the same collection of materials used previously
                    with memoriter techniques are simply called Unit IV or Unit VII as the case may be. Publishers of
                    textbooks have grouped the first three chapters of a previously published book as Unit I and
                    Chapters IV, V, VI, and VII as Unit II, and so on. With only the table of contents changed the book
                    has been republished as an unit history. Such units lack a core idea, an organizing principal, a
                    central theme. They are artificial. The "unit" organization has much in its favor
                    but the unit must be natural and not book-made or school-made.</p>
            <p>How may units be natural? They may be natural only when they are phases or manifestations of the
                    great underlying forces and causes, of the innate human urges, of the great historical movements.
                    What is an historical movement? One definition is that an historical movement is a natural world
                    trend around which cluster associated or related events, thoughts, feelings, and/or conditions. A
                    trend is comparable to the theme in a Bach fugue or the plot of a story. It is a dynamic idea which
                    moves along its course like a planet drawing satellites unto itself. It is comparable to a magnet
                    drawn between two rows of steel filings pulling them unto itself. It may be compared to the string
                    of a strand of beads. The string is the movement idea, the core idea, the organizing principle, the
                    unifying theme which holds the beads together. The beads represent the phases or the manifestations
                    of the idea. They are the units which themselves are held together as individual entities and in
                    relation to each other by the movement idea. These phases become actual units of study.</p>
            <p>The story of mankind is the story of these movements for these movements are history. Once they are
                    mastered all else is illustration. All history would be organized for <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-031-4-071"/> teaching purposes around these movements. One example would be the
                    humanitarian movement. Examples of phases of the humanitarian movement which would become units of
                    related study are the anti-slavery crusade, the temperance crusade, the evolution of the public
                    school, world peace, religious tolerance, political liberalism, extension of suffrage, and labor
                    organization. These would be the beads along the string. A second example would be the world
                    movement for national unification. Studied as a movement the national unification of
                            <placeName>

                    </placeName>, culmination about 1871, would be seen as phases or manifestations of the same dynamic
                    urge. The unification of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would be related in thought to the same development in these other countries. <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> may have had Treitschke, Schiller, Fichte, and Goethe laying the basis for unity, but
                    the Untied States had Bancroft, Longfellow, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Emerson, and Whittier. The trilogy of wars of 1864, 1866, and 1870 may have been cruel
                    measures, but so were the cartridges and bayonets of the armies of the North in the Civil War which
                    was not merely a struggle between two sections in a single nation but a part of a great world
                    movement. Already the slavery issue has been considered as but one phase of something much
                    larger—the humanitarian movement. Proper perspective and sense of values are promoted.
                    Likewise could illustration be given in terms of other movements—the Industrial
                    Revolution or the Westward Movement.</p>
            <p>Through the study of history in terms of movements does one develop a sense of continuity, of
                    development, of evolution. Events succeed events and through them flow these urges as organizing
                    principles. Through a study of parallels a sense of balance and assurance is derived. The movements
                    are the parallel threads, the warp, and the cross-references are the woof woven on the shuttle of
                    history by universal human nature. A sense of relationships of design and pattern is born.
                    Understandings of where we have been, of where we are, of how we got this way, serve as bases of
                    anticipation of whither we are going or at least <hi rend="i">trending.</hi> It becomes unnecessary
                    to be so completely harassed and harrowed, to feel so absolutely impotent. Human affairs are
                    understandable, even mutable. Something has been done and can be done about them. The trend may not
                    be stemmed but it may be understood and, perhaps, channeled and given direction.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Amory K. Allen was a young man who lived in or near Loogootee, Indiana. Though he had a wife and
                    young children, he volunteered for service at the beginning of the Civil War. Another child, that he
                    was not privileged to see until after the close of the conflict, was born several months after his
                    enlistment. Before the newly formed regiments left Camp <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo</region>
                    </placeName>, Private <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen</region>
                    </placeName> became Corporal Allen. From Antietam to the last months of the War, he was Sergeant
                    Allen. Promotion to First Lieutenant came in the last campaign. He belonged to Company C of the
                    Fourteenth Indiana Regiment until 1865. Escaping injury until 1864, Sergeant Allen was wounded in
                    the leg, but not seriously when Grant's army was leaving the Wilderness to advance toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After a short period in a hospital, he was, without a furlough, returned to active
                    service. He was with the forces at Petersburg. On April 6, but three days prior to Lee's
                    surrender, Lieutenant Allen was shot through the left shoulder and sent to Seminary Hospital in
                    Georgetown, D. C. The last letter in the collection was written by the veteran of many campaigns on
                    April 23 while still confined to his bed. At this time, he was still unable to use his shoulder. He
                    probably did not reach home before the middle of May or the first of June, 1865. Lieutenant Allen
                    died at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on August 13, 1885.</p>

                              <hi rend="sup">3</hi> This letter was written on a sheet (four pages) of
                                        letter paper 5 × 8 inches. At the upper, left corner of page one,
                                        Corporal Allen must have pasted a small picture, or a clipping from a newspaper,
                                        as he did not write anything in this space. On the second page, he wrote on the
                                        reverse of this space. At some time after the letter reached his wife, the
                                        picture or clipping was cut out with a very sharp knife. It must have been a
                                        knife because the edges of the cut are as clean as if cut with a razor blade,
                                        but on one of the three cut edges the line does not appear to be one that could
                                        have been made with a pair of scissors. The result of the cutting is that, while
                                        nothing is lost from the first page, the last portion (about half) of eight
                                        lines at the top of page two are missing. It is possible to fill out the lost
                                        parts of words that were cut through but not the other missing words. The last
                                        two of the marred sentences evidently refer to leaves of absence for trips home.
                                        The first sentence seems to refer to equipment.</item>

                                    they have charge of squads going out of the camp and of placing and releiveing [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] guards that stands around the camp to keep men from getting

                                    one man drumed out of the service for mis behavior getting drunk fighting and
                                    abusing the officers he was made to march along the line of dress parade on Sunday
                                    evening with a chain lock around his leg with a big chunk of wood to drag after him
                                    he wore this 2 or 3 days and was marched out without any pay for his service the
                                    tune of the rogues march was played for him I guess he has gone home if that is the
                                    way to get home I never want to come. I think our Colonel wisely looks<hi rend="sup">4</hi> for us and will do the best he can for us and our Capt. does firstrate

                                    not I expect he will wait for the uniform we exp[ect] to get that tomorrow or next
                                    day keep in good heart and take good care of my dear little children and I will not

                        <p>I take the opportunity to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well hoping
                                    that you and the Children are enjoying the same blessing I have nothing certain of

                                    not see or hear any thing at all in comparison to what is going on here although I
                                    see and hear more than I could write in 3 years, the colonel came to camp yesterday
                                    evening and attende[d] the evening Dress parade with us he then left camp and went
                                    to town and I heard this morning that he had gone to <placeName>

                                    chance of talking any with him only just to say how-de-do he said you was all well
                                    and all right, the way the orders are now there will be no chance of any of us going
                                    home we have give up the idea entirely of coming home at the present although it may
                                    be sometime yet before we leave here, we may have other orders in a short time the
                                    orders now is to be ready to march at one hours notice but from the news and the way

                                    lines will find you enjoying the same good blessing I wrote you a letter a few days
                                    ago and started it by mail but I suppose it will be a good while a going and to day
                                    is Sunday and I have been resting all day in Camp the boys have been making
                                    themselves rings out of the root of a bush that grows on the mountains here that is
                                    called laurel it has a very nice blossom and is very poison to cattle or any thing
                                    that eats of it I dont know what put it in their heads to make rings out of it but I
                                    think the people here make pipes out of it they say it gets as hard as a bone and
                                    makes a very good and lasty pipe so I thought I would whittle one out and send it to
                                    you so you could have it to say I had sent you something from <placeName>

                                    could ran away and the balance that could gave themselves up and all they had so we
                                    had nothing to do but to march a head after the run a ways but we hav not come in
                                    contact with them yet we have run them across cheat river which is the line I

                                    some for fear that I might need some and I think 50 Dollars will do you for a while
                                    if I should be sick or wounded I might need some money the sick and wounded are
                                    taken care of free of charge but there is so many to geather that it is better to
                                    get a private house to stay at and pay board if one can there was a great many of
                                    our wounded died at Winchester they took the irrisiplis [erysipelas] and that is
                                    catching and very dangerous in a wound we have formed a society in our company to
                                    furnish money to send our dead to their homes when it is so we possible [can] and
                                    our friends at home may expect the bodies of their friends that die hear to be sent
                                    home to be buried we sent Adam Marx to Loogootee he was wounded in the leg at the
                                    battle of Winchester and his leg was cut off and he took the irrisiplis in it and
                                    died he was a brave soldier the pay we got was in treasuery notes I got 2 20 Dollar
                                    notes and one ten Dollar note and 2 one Dollar gold pieces and I have traded with
                                    the boys til I have got 10 of them [gold pieces] and as gold is scarce I want to
                                    save them and I will send them to you to keep for hard times you may know that I
                                    will not have much left after this but I am in hopes we will get out pay again
                                    before long there will be 2 months more coming to us the last of this month but you
                                    must be saving of your money for you know how it comes and it may not come when you
                                    expect it the arrangements are made to take the money by express and I hope it will
                                    go safely to you and no one can get it but you tell Miss Tate Nat Tate is sending
                                    some to her by express and I suppose it will all come at the same time so no more at

                                    since we have traveled near 200 miles we went to Fredricksburg on the rappahannock
                                    river we stayed there 3 nights and got orders to march and came right back we did
                                    not know what for til we got back to Catlets station we began to hear the news the
                                    fact was that as soon as we left the shenandoah valley old Jackson came back and run
                                    [General] banks out and took possession of strausburg and Winchester<hi rend="sup">19</hi> again and had run some other of new york troops out from front royal
                                    and along the manasses railroad and I guess it is in the papers that we were cut off
                                    but we are not cut off yet now we are not going to be we went to manassas junction
                                    from Catlets station and had orders to go to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                                    </placeName> but the order was countermanded and we turned west towards manassas gap
                                    and came through thoroughfair gap along the manasses gap railroad and camped hear
                                    [Rector Town] last night and we are resting to day it is about 15 or 20 miles from
                                    hear to front royal and about 30 to strasburg this railroad runs to strasburg it is
                                    about 5 miles from hear to manasses gap the secesh have burned a bridge some where
                                    in hear since they come back but I guess they will not stop us hear long I guess if <placeName>

                                    and left us at Winchester but he found out that we was not the running kind so he
                                    had to run him self we run him about 80 miles and could not get a fight out of him
                                    no place I dont know how they are getting along I suppose there is some secesh at
                                    front royal there was some new yorkers in hear that run out as we come in and said
                                    the secesh was coming but we have not seen any of them yet except a few scouts we
                                    took prisoners yesterday that we heard was trying to get away you said it had been a
                                    long time since you had got a letter and that it was a long time on the road I think
                                    it has been longer since I got one and they had been longer on the road we have not
                                    been payed yet I will send you money again when I get my pay it is hard earned but I
                                    want you to enjoy it if I cant there is many things that I could spend money for but
                                    it is but little enjoyment to me I could spend twice as much as I get and never see
                                    any good it done tobacco is verry high and some times we are short of provisions and
                                    that is all that is necessary for any one to spend money for I could squander all of
                                    my money and you would never know what become of it I could tell some story about it
                                    and that would be the end of it I wrote a letter to you from front royal as we went
                                    along and one at catlets station but I did not get to send it til I got to
                                    fredricksburg I sent it and some words in Tates letter to you so no more at present

                                    a place since we left new market where Capt Brooks and James McRiley left us on the
                                    11th of may we have traveled over 300 miles since we left there we are about 40
                                    miles from new market and about 14 miles east of Strasburg and about 28 miles
                                    southeast of Winchester. We have been to Fredricksburg on the rappahannock river and
                                    we came back by the way of Manasses Junction and to this place when we got hear as
                                    we came back from Fredricksburg we found the secesh hear that had come down the
                                    valley after we left and drove our troops out with a hard fight and <pb n="351" id="VAA4025-031-4-087"/> took possession of the place and had run banks down the
                                    valley and went to Winchester and martinsburg<hi rend="sup">21</hi> but what we
                                    found hear was soon dispersed they heard that shields was a coming and they got away
                                    from hear as soon as possible our Brigade under Brigadier Gen. Kimbal came in the
                                    advance and fired a few shots at them and they set the depo and some cars on fire
                                    and left we had but few cavelry with us but Colonel Dom our artilery man led them
                                    and rushed them across the Bridges and saved them from burning and cut of some
                                    waggons and took some 150 prisoners and captured our prisoners that was taken when
                                    the secesh come down we run them towards strasburg and we heard fiting that way the
                                    next 2 or 3 days we started that way and heard banks had whooped [them] and we
                                    turned back and went up this side of the mountain and river the east side and we
                                    heard canonading in the other valley 3 or 4 days we went up the east side of the
                                    river above Leuray and the 4th Brigade went up some 90 miles to post Republic to cut
                                    of Jacksons retreat as Fremont [General John C. Fremont] was pitching in to him in
                                    the west valley there is a mountain [Massanuten] in the forks of the Shenandoah
                                    river that runs from hear up to port republic and there is but one place to cross it
                                    and that is east of new market<hi rend="sup">22</hi> so <placeName>

                                    </placeName> went clean above the mountain and burned all the Bridges on the river
                                    up to post republick our men got to it and tried to hold it but was entirely
                                    overpowered and had to fall back badly whooped for they fought til they were half
                                    killed wounded and taken prisoners and if we had have been there we would probably
                                    have held the Bridge and <placeName>

                                    there was only apart of the 3 and 4th Brigade of Shields Division there the rest of
                                    us was about 12 miles to slow we waited to cover the retreat but <placeName>

                                    evening we have been on the march from front royal for 3 days we are almost worn out
                                    tramping around we have been in no fight lately we were ordered to <placeName>

                                    </placeName> and we are on our way but we are so near wore out that I think they
                                    will surely give us a little rest or take us on the cars but that is not Fashionable
                                    for we have been traveling right along the rail road for over a month and the cars
                                    running and soldiers riding and we walked the whole time we have had very hard fair
                                    for along time—while there is others that have had nothing to do we may
                                    rest hear or we may not we may go to richmond or we may not or we may go to <placeName>

                                    </placeName> will be back their again as for going to richmond I dont hardly think
                                    we will get their in time for the fight for McClellen says he will take his dinner
                                    there the 4th of July and as for resting we will not be apt to get any til the war
                                    is over but I think when richmond is taken the fighting is about over and indeed I
                                    hope to god it will be soon I long to see the day that I will be at home with you
                                    again the way we have been draged around is enough to ware a mans body and mind and
                                    life out it is aggravating enough to ware out the patience of Jobe or any other man
                                    tell miss green that Tom [Green] is with us and he is able to be about but he is
                                    wore out he is not able to do any service for him self or any body else hear and has
                                    not been for some time and will not bee soon if he dont get better and get rest and
                                    a chance to take Something to help him he might as well be discharged for he will
                                    not do any good without he gets better he will not get stout while he is draged
                                    around with us he is not able to carry his gun and march with us Tate is well no

                        <p>My Dear Wife I take the opportunity to day to write to you to let you know that I am
                                    well and hearty hoping this will find you and my Dear little Children enjoying the
                                    same blessing I received your letter dated the 21st day before yesterday evening
                                    from your writing you must have wrote it on the 22nd I received one last friday
                                    evening dated the 20th and wrote an answer to it on Saturday I was so buisy
                                    yesterday I did not heave a chance to write we were drawing new cartridge boxes and
                                    accouterments and getting some new guns and there was something to do every little
                                    bit so I did not write until to day I am on guard but my relief has stood 2 hours
                                    and we are relieved and I have just eat my dinner and I have about 3 hours to write
                                    and rest before my relief comes on again So hear goes for it as the boy said when he
                                    run by himself we had potatoes for dinner and I have a full belly and a strong back
                                    we get plenty to eat hear now we get corn meal potatoes and onions this is a great
                                    vari[e]ty for us we get fresh and salt beef and salt pork sugar Coffee Molasses and
                                    vinegar and the dead loads of Crackers our sutler has got hear and has any quantity
                                    of preserves to sell which are very good, there is a powerful sight of soldiers hear
                                    there is no telling how many by looking and guessing for you can see no end or side
                                    but for all this is a lonesome place for me there is scarcely a woman ever to be
                                    seen or any thing else but soldiers there is hardly any houses in this part of the
                                    country the house where general Harrison once lived is hear close to the river we
                                    are camped about one mile from the river the house where John Tyler lived that got
                                    to be president by Harrisons death is not far from hear but I have not seen it yet
                                    Tyler is dead now too. it might have been a good thing for this Country if it had a
                                    been Tyler that died in the place of Harrison for I believe this war has been a
                                    brewing ever since and every body knows that Tyler made a poor president and all
                                    thought that Harrison would have made a good one and the world has been in an uproar
                                    ever since and now it is at a high pitch and if it is pitched much Higher it will
                                    pitch clear over we have been laying hear doing nothing for sometime only having
                                    reviews and inspections and Drilling I dont know what we are waiting for but I
                                    suppose somebody else does so I am content as it is the best way to be thoug[h] this
                                    is an awful lonesom[e] place to me there is some talk of their taking us back to the
                                    shanendoah valley again this looks to me like foolishness but still I had rather be
                                    trotting round there after the rebels than to be laying hear there is better water
                                    there than there is hear and I think it is healthier in them parts than it is hear
                                    but this is only camp news we have no orders to go any place yet I expect we will
                                    leave hear when we get orders and I expect we will go where ever we are ordered to
                                    if the order is not countermanded before we get there so you can guess about when we
                                    will start and what time we will get there so it is no use for me to write anything
                                    about it until after it all happens so I must bring my letter to a close I was
                                    surprised to hear that he had got home so soon I wrote you a letter a Sunday after
                                    he started <pb n="355" id="VAA4025-031-4-091"/> and thought it would get there as
                                    soon as he would and I wrote another last Saturday and named in it that I though tom
                                    would get home that day he must have been lucky about getting his pay I expected he
                                    would have to stay at <placeName>

                                    </placeName> city all monday to fix his business but I am glad to hear he got home
                                    safe any how you said you wanted me to write once a week I think I have wrote twice
                                    a week almost so good by for a while</p>

                                    present hoping this will find you and my Dear little Children enjoying good health.
                                    I received your letters yesterday <pb n="357" id="VAA4025-031-4-093"/> evening one
                                    dated the 15th of September just one month ago to day the other September 28th they
                                    have been a long time on the road they we[re] sent to <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                                    </placeName> and stoped there for us to get settled before they were sent to us we
                                    never get any mail when we are on a march or expecting a fight but we have been hear
                                    ever since the 22nd of sept. and we have never got any mail since we started to
                                    drive the secesh out of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                                    </placeName> until a few days ago. I have been aggravated half to death about the
                                    mail being so long behind times and nothing to hinder us from having it only the
                                    neglect of some of our leaders to attend to it. the mail comes from there hear now
                                    in about 4 days and I hope I will hear from you soon again I had almost got out of
                                    all hopes of writing any more or getting any more letters from you I wrote a letter
                                    to you from the battle feild of antietem creek and capt. Houghten went home from
                                    there and Clem Riley went from hear since we came hear and I knew that you had
                                    heared from us and knew where we was but I thought the time long waiting to hear
                                    from you I havent heard from you for so long before this that I have wore the
                                    letters out I believe the last I got was in august about the time Dobbins company
                                    was starting out and it is now about 3 weeks since the date of your latest letter I
                                    have no good news to tell you we are in camp at Harpers Ferry and we may stay hear
                                    all winter this is an important point and there will be some soldiers stay hear as
                                    this place is not to be give up again I don't know whether they will let us
                                    stay hear or not there is a report going in camp that governor Morton is trying to
                                    get us to come home to rest and recruit this winter but I dont suppose they will let
                                    us stop any where as long as we can raise 10 men that can drag one foot after the
                                    other our regiment is small now you wanted to know who messed with me now my mess is
                                    about played out when we first started out we were formed in messes of 6 men in a
                                    mess. I had C. Walls, A. W. Love, Thomas Green, J. B. Padget, and Thomas A. Wood for
                                    messmates and now out of the 5 there is but one left that is Thomas A. Wood, him and
                                    I are the only 2 left of the old mess. Walls cut his finger off and was Discharged
                                    at cheat Mountain. Love was Discharged at Huttonville on account of sickness and
                                    Thomas Green was Discharged at Harrisons Landing wore out and J. B. Padget was
                                    killed in the Battle of Antietem on the 17th of sept. Wood is hear now he was not in
                                    the Battle he was behind with the sick and barefooted he is well and hearty now
                                    though he has been sick several times and left behind. I am the only one that has
                                    not been at hospital I have never been left behind yet I have been in every fight
                                    and on every march that the regiment has had since we started out and have never
                                    rode or had my napsack hauled on account of sickness I have been very lucky and
                                    fortunate I have went through seven engagements with the enemy and have not been
                                    hurt though it does not look like I could come through it again for I was right in
                                    the face of the enemy at Winchester my canteen was shot off and in the battle of
                                    antietem I was color guard and color Bearer a good part of the time the color Bearer
                                    handing them to me to hold while he was helping his wounded and dying friends of [f]
                                    of the feild the colors is always a mark to shoot at and the color bearers is almost
                                    sure to get <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-031-4-094"/> shot but our flag is bound to wave
                                    I was not touched only by a small piece of a shell that droped on me doing no injury
                                    there was 6 of us color guards and out of the 6 4 of us was shot 2 of them are dead
                                    the other 2 I dont know whether they are living or not one of them was Abe Howard he
                                    was shot right by my side and died the same night I was very sorry to see him fall I
                                    could no nothing for him only wish him well he appeared well satisfied and I trust
                                    he is at rest he was a good and a brave soldier he fought bravely and fired some 100
                                    rounds before he was shot we fought side by side and spoke to each other in time of
                                    the fight he was a shore shot on the secesh at a time when I was a holding our
                                    colors he spoke to me and said he was going to try the secesh colors a pop and he
                                    pulled off and sure enough they fell, a secesh was gone up if abe pulled triger on
                                    him we had a hard fight of it I being with the colors did not know much about our
                                    company until the fight was over and it was awful J. B. Padget R. Bryant John McCord
                                    Ed. Frainer killed and most of the rest wounded J. W. Alford has since died he only
                                    lived a few days and Steven H. Collins and William Lloyd I suppose was both killed
                                    we have not heard anything of them since the fight Boliver Gold and R. Conolty are
                                    both hear well and hearty it is not worth while for me to write the names of all the
                                    wounded now as I suppose all their friends have heard from them before now so I will

                                    wrote 2 and this makes 3 I wrote one from the Battle field and one from hear I have
                                    been looking for an answer to the last one for several days but when I got your
                                    letter I was surprised to think you had not got it yet I dont know what makes
                                    letters go so slow it is no use of writing when they dont go I have been out of all
                                    heart about writing I got a letter the other day from you dated the 24th of august
                                    this is the way your letters comes to me I got 2 others at once one was dated the
                                    15th September and the other the 28th and I wrote an answer to it as soon as I got
                                    it and it has been long enough for you to have got it before you wrote on the 21st
                                    of October I hope you have got it before now I wrote to you in it about selling the
                                    cow I had forgot to say anything about it in my letters before I wrote to you to
                                    sell her if you could get any thing for her for you might need what you could get
                                    for her to live on and I expect you will it has been so long since I sent you any

                        <p rend="center">November the 2nd 1862 good morning.</p>
                        <p>Capt. Houghten got hear yesterday and I was anxious to see him before he went on to
                                    the regiment so that I put my writing aside when I heard of him and put out to hunt
                                    him up I found him and had a chat with him and did not get back in time to finish my
                                    letter so I am at it this morning I feel tolerable well this morning and I think I
                                    will be able to go on to the regiment soon Capt Houghten is hear yet he is going to
                                    the regiment with the sutler or with the ambulence train we were just as proud to
                                    meet as Brothers he thinks a great deal of me in fact he thinks well of all the boys
                                    but more especialy those that was in the fight and stood up to the work him and I
                                    was about the last to come of the field me carrying the colors and using my gun both
                                    he is going to make me a sergeant now that will add 3 dollars a month to my wages so
                                    I am raising a little this will help me and you along some they say a child must
                                    crawl before they walk I think that I have been along time a crawling but perhaps I
                                    may learn to walk yet if I dont it shal not be my fault the capt. thought strange to
                                    see me behind and it is no wonder for I have always been on hand with him and the
                                    company before they dont know what it is to go without me I have been the main stay
                                    well I wrote in my other letters to you to get another house to live in where you
                                    can have some peace and get away from the Devilish Children of Williamses I dont
                                    want you to be bothered with any bodys Children but my own and I want you to take
                                    good care of <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-031-4-096"/> them and keep them away from such
                                    Devilish Children as much as possible and learn them to be Smart Children that will
                                    be a pleasure instead of a trouble I have not anything more to write at present I
                                    hope you will get this soon and I hope it will find you well and that you will be
                                    satisfied about me I expect to write to you often and if you dont get my letters I
                                    cant help it I have plenty of good warm cloths for the winter and I allow to try to
                                    take care of myself as much as possible I would give anything to be with you I hope
                                    we shal be togeather again the hopes of a better day is all that keeps me alive I
                                    could not live a day if I thought I would never see you and my Children any more
                                    though the chance looks slim but I trust that God will bring me safe home to you
                                    again our time is half gone if we stay 3 years but I believe that 3 months more will

                                    and the board of examiners is crowded all the time there is a great many hear that
                                    has been trying to get examined for 2 or 3 weeks and cant get in there is citizens
                                    hear getting their friends discharged they are mostly from the eastern States and
                                    they manage to get them in and examined first and the western men that has nobody to
                                    do any thing for them stand a bad chance to get any thing done for them until the
                                    others get though there is so many trying to get discharged that there is nothing
                                    else talked about I dont know whether I could get a Discharge or not. or whether I
                                    could stand soldiering any more or not I thought I would be examined any how before
                                    I go to the regiment and if they give me a discharge I will come home and if not I
                                    will try the tramp again and see how I will come out I dont suppose I could get a
                                    furlough they only give furloughs to them that is wounded so you need not look to
                                    hard for me to come home now for fear you may be disappointed but I hope the time
                                    will soon roll round that will bring me home with you again we stay in tents hear
                                    yet and sleep on the ground the eastern troops have most all gone in to Barricks we

                                    will be dry and warmer and off of the ground I may get better in such a place I am
                                    about as hearty as ever I was but I am not stout and can not stand hardships like I
                                    use tb stand them but I may get stout again if I had a good chance I am not in a
                                    suffering condition. I hope this will find you and my Dear little Children in good

                                    you must try and hire your wood choped it is to much for you to have to chop wood
                                    and attend to your children and you cannot chop your wood without neglecting the
                                    children you said you had got Thomas Green to chop some for you and you can get him
                                    to chop more and tell him he will be sure to get his pay whatever he charges he
                                    knows something about soldiering and how the pay comes and he knows what is right so
                                    keep in good heart and every thing will come out right yet yours for ever</p>

                        <p>My Dear Companion I take the present opportunity to answer your letter of the 13th
                                    inst. that Charles Gibson brought to me. he got hear yesterday he was one day behind
                                    time but he is all right now he said he went to your house and stayed some 2 hours
                                    with you he said there was 2 little Children there you called mine and he guessed
                                    they was that they looked like me very much and especially their curly hair and he
                                    said there was a mighty good looking girl there I suppose it was Sis<hi rend="sup">28</hi> he asked me how old you was he supposed that you was older than I am I
                                    told him that I was a little the oldest when I left home but I hardly knowed which
                                    was the oldest now I have been midling peart and kept myself clean and I suppose he
                                    thinks I am as young as any of the boys soldiering Charles says he had a fine time
                                    while he was at home he says he had to kiss most every woman he met old and young
                                    Charly says it cost him about 50 dollars but he dont begruge it of course money is
                                    no object to him his father has plenty to give him when he gets out</p>
                        <p>Well I wrote a letter to you a few days after Charly started home that you said you
                                    got just before he started back and after you had writ the most of the one he
                                    brought I wrote my opinion about furlows in it and I got one [letter] from you on
                                    the 15th dated the 9th inst and I wrote an answer to it and said I thought I would
                                    try to get a furlow and come home if I could and I am of the same opinion yet but it
                                    will be a good while before I get one if I get one at all you must keep in good
                                    spirits I will come if I can and I think I will stand a good chance if we dont get
                                    in to active movements or engagements with the enemy so that the Furlows will be
                                    stoped which I expect will be done when we get in to active operations but if I dont
                                    get to come home this spring I think I will get to come in the fall and get to stay
                                    longer than I could if I was to come now so keep in good heart and dont never give
                                    up for the worst I have the likenesses you sent me yet and I think it is the
                                    prettiest little family that could be I hope the time will soon come that I can be
                                    with you you are ever in my mind I would give anything in my possession to be with
                                    you but I am in the service of my country and I will serve it faithfully and do my
                                    duty and if I never see you more I will do nothing that will disgrace you or my
                                    Children or my people state or government and if I should live I expect to serve my
                                    time out and come home manly and with honor to myself and country honorably
                                    Discharged and I hope to live in peace and comfort the rest of my days and I shall
                                    never be ashamed or afeared to see or be seen by any body well I have just been out

                        <salute>Dear Wife,</salute>
                        <p>I received your letter of the 25th yesterday evening which gave me much satisfaction
                                    to hear that you and my Dear little Children was all well and I now take pleasure to
                                    write you a few lines to let you know that I am well and hearty hoping when this
                                    reaches you it may find you enjoying the same blessing. I am in good spirits I think
                                    we will come out right, the boys are mostly all well and lively governor Morton was
                                    hear to see us the other day and made us a short speech he said he thought the war
                                    would soon be over and that we would all soon get to come to our homes and that we
                                    would be received with the highest honors possible he said we had went through more
                                    than any other Regt that he knowed of but he thought the embraces of our relations
                                    and the blessings and simpathies of friends would pay us for all he said he thought
                                    that the old regiments would be filled up with drafted men and let the old officers
                                    and soldiers learn them how to soldier and that suits us exactly for men that have
                                    stayed at home this long has no right to be an officer of any kind they need old
                                    soldiers over them to make them soldier and I wish they would send them right out at
                                    once there is some that has been a pitying the south and they will find out that
                                    they had better pity their own selves before they get through yet they dont think
                                    there is a war or a government or soldiers out fighting and suffering and dying for
                                    their country but they will find out and the sooner the better for the war is going
                                    to go on through til the Rebellion is put down well you said Hattenback had got to
                                    Loogootee and was in good health I am glad to hear he is well tell him that I am in

                                    all enjoying the same blessing I received your letter of the 12inst. yesterday
                                    evening just as we were going out on dress parade the parade was soon over and I
                                    hastened to read your letter it give me great satisfaction to hear that you was all
                                    well and I hope you will keep in good spirits and that your hopes and wishes will be
                                    rewarded soon I received a letter from vester that he wrote while you was there but
                                    I have received none from John I answered vesters letter a few days ago I wrote a
                                    letter and sent to you by J. C. Williman he left hear last Sunday on a furlow and I
                                    suppose he got to Loogootee by Wednesday we got marching orders about the time I
                                    wrote to vester but we have not marched yet we have 8 days ration on hand we have 5
                                    days packed in our napsacks and have orders to keep that much in them all the time
                                    ready to march all the time so we may march to day may be to morrow may be not for
                                    weeks but there! is going to be something done soon you need not be surprised to
                                    hear of a big Battle about Fredricksburg in a short time and that our side will gain
                                    the victory for everyone thinks we will whip out this time easy we are a going to
                                    fight them any way and no dout there will be a great many lifes lost this is certain
                                    to be the case with both sides we have a large army hear and it is in good trim for
                                    fighting and they all like General hooker [Joseph E. Hooker] first rate they think
                                    he will do them justice he has fed them well all winter ever since he took command
                                    of the army we have had soft Bread and onions and potatoes most of the time and the
                                    men think their general kears something for them and they dont dread to go in to a
                                    fight under him this makes a great difference with men about fighting they must like
                                    their general or they will not fight for him so I think we will make a good fight of
                                    it when we get at it and we are going at it and we are going to fight they call our
                                    general fighting Jo. so he must be a fighter I am going to take things as they come
                                    and if it comes my turn to fight I am going to do it on the square I am not going to
                                    show my back to Rebels if I should happen to fall it will be no Disgrace to my
                                    country or people but I hope and trust I will come out safe as I have before and I
                                    have no doubt or fears of being killed though there is no telling who will fall in
                                    battle so I must close we are still looking for <list type="footnotes">

                        <salute>My Dear Companion</salute>
                        <p>I received your letter of the 17th inst yesterday I was glad to hear that you was all
                                    well I am well and hearty an in good heart and I hope this will find you enjoying
                                    the same blessing I wrote to you a few days ago and sent you 25 dollars in the
                                    letter I hope you will get it I would have sent you more but I was afraid to risk
                                    much in a letter and I will have a chance to send you some more soon I think that
                                    waggoner of our company will start home on a furlow about the last of this month and
                                    I will send you some by him when he goes home he will go right to Loogootee and will
                                    take the money safe we are still in camp and we are expected to stay hear along time
                                    so I dont think we will have much marching to do this summer or much fighting unless
                                    the rebs come across the river our men are giving them fits in the south and south
                                    west I dont know what will turn up but I think we will soon whip them all out before
                                    a great while we are getting them in a bad fix well I have not much to write to you
                                    I suppose you have heard from georg E Fraim before this time we got a few lines from
                                    him since I wrote my last and I suppose he has written home before now but I will
                                    state a part of his letter he wrote that he was taken prisoner on the morning of the
                                    6th inst (which was the morning the army fell back across the river) and was [G. E.
                                    Fraim] marched to richmond and kept there some days and was parolled and sent to our
                                    lines and went to anapolis <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                                    </placeName> he is a parolled prisoner he is not yet exchanged but I see in the
                                    papers that they are exchanging prisoners that was taken in that fight and probably
                                    he will be exchanged right away and come right back to the regt but if he is not
                                    exchanged he will stay at the parolled prisoners camp and probably will get to go
                                    home and stay awhile he was well and he is all right any way he is safe out of the
                                    Rebels hands and in the care of the <placeName>

                                    with Thomas A. Wood, and Thomas Clements. I was acquainted with them both before I
                                    left home and I suppose that you know them both Clements got a letter from his
                                    sister yesterday she wrote that she heard that he was among the missing but he is
                                    hear with me and him and wood is both well I suppose he will write home soon his
                                    sister wrote to him that she went to about 3 dances a week some times and to one
                                    every week I would like to be at home at a nice dance very well my self I dont know
                                    when I will get to come but I am going to come as soon as I can and I hope that will
                                    be soon I would like to be at home dance or no dance if I could get to see you arid
                                    the Children it would be dance enough for me you wrote to me some <list type="footnotes">

                                            from May 3 and May 7 and was fought south of the Rappahannock, a few miles

                                    taken with my uniform on I have had no chance until now there is a chance of getting
                                    it taken not far from our camp so I think I will have one or 2 taken I think and
                                    send home I expect I look just about the same as ever I hope that you will get to
                                    see my natural face before another year well I have nothing more of importance I
                                    will just say that we get plenty to eat out sutler has buter to sell at 60 cts per
                                    lb and eggs at 5 cts a peice and apples at 5 cts a peice cheese 40 cts per pound so
                                    if a man wants to spend his money it wont take him long to do it a soldier will give
                                    any price for any thing he wants though his money is earned by the hardest so no

                        <p>I take my pen in hand this morning to let you know that I am well and stout and
                                    hearty and I hope when this reaches you it will find you and my Dear little Children
                                    all enjoying the same blessing I received your letter of the 26th ult stating that
                                    you had got my letter with 25 Dollars that I sent you which I was very glad to hear
                                    I hope it will help you along for a while you must be as saving as you can if I get
                                    to come home it will cost a good little pile of money but I dont expect I will come
                                    soon they have changed the furlows and only give them 5 days now instead of 15 so
                                    that would not give me time enough to come home and get back and I will not pretend
                                    to come home on so short a furlow I think they will give longer ones after awhile
                                    again Lieutenant Nicholas has gone home on 15 day furlow waggoner did not get to
                                    start before the time was changed and he is not going to take a 5 day furlow some
                                    takes them that want to go to <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                                    </placeName> and them that live close enough to go and get back in the time Nicholas
                                    said he would try to go to loogootee and if he does he will be apt to call and see
                                    you the company bought him a fine sword and presented to him before he started home
                                    he is quite a fine man and makes a good officer he will be our Captain when he
                                    returns and Rogers 1st Lieutenant and Levi N. Dunlap 2nd Lieut, and I suppose I will
                                    be orderly sergeant. I would have been Lieutenant now if the right thing had been
                                    done but they jumped Roggers over Dunlap and me both it may all come right but there
                                    is one thing certain I think that the boys will never buy Roggers a sword they all
                                    despise him and they dont like Houghten either he was the cause of roggers being
                                    jumped up neither of them would ever get a vote from company C. for any office, this
                                    is something they will never forget through life they all think well of Hopkins and
                                    Nicholas and they all thought well of <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                                    </placeName> and would go their bottom Dollar on either of them and will for ever
                                    hear after do everything in their power but the way things stand now it will be
                                    right to the reverse with Houghten and Roggers and I guess they know it and I think
                                    they both hate themselves for they cant blame the company for it is all right it
                                    would take at least a dosen such Majors as houghten to impeach their <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-031-4-105"/> character there is but few of us but we are mostly all
                                    very powerful men there are 4 medals to be given to each camp for Bravery and good
                                    soldiery to 4 of the best men I suppose that I will get one of them as I have been
                                    in the most battles and stood the longest they cant well get round it well I must
                                    close for this time we are still laying in camp and no sign of moving I dont think
                                    for a while I will send you more money before long if I dont get to come home I got
                                    a letter from Emily Houts a few days ago they was all well I still remain yours

                                    camp ground the weather is very warm it dont seem that we could stand to march at
                                    all now but we have marched when the weather was as hot as it is now this last
                                        campain<hi rend="sup">30</hi> was the hardest and longest we ever had we marched
                                    about 400 miles almost without stoping a day and not much more than stopping a night
                                    we was all the time from the 14th of June when he left Falmouth till we camped hear
                                    in a continual strain and hurry if we slept any we would have no time to cook and if
                                    we cooked we had no time to sleep we never knew what minute we would get in to a
                                    fight or have to pick up and start on a march day or night there was a great many
                                    that give out on the march and some fell dead on the road marching along and several
                                    were sunstruck or overhet so that they will never get over it our cam-pain was a
                                    very hard one but I think it has done a great deal towards ending the war therefore
                                    I do not begrudge my tramp I stood tolerable well as well as the best of them I was
                                    never behind, there was not many knapsacks or woolen blankets carried through the
                                    road was strowed with blankets and clothing I carried no blankets but I carried my

                        <p>My Dear Wife I take pleasure this morning to write you to answer your kind letter of
                                    the 7th Inst. which I received night before last it gave me great satisfaction to
                                    hear that you and my Dear little Children are all a living. I am well and hearty and
                                    I hope these lines will find you all enjoying the same blessing I am sorry the
                                    Children are so puny but I hope they will soon get stout and healthy again, the
                                    weather is so hot that it is very hard on weakly Children, the best way to stand hot
                                    weather is to keep away all filth of every description and keep perfectly clean and
                                    keep as cool as possible in the freshest air that can be had and use moderate diet
                                    and not overload the stomach with unwholesome food and not drink too much cold water
                                    at a time when a person is warm if all these things is noticed particular and
                                    carfully attended to it would be of much benefit to the general health of all
                                    persons particular in hot weather these rules is followed closely in the army when
                                    we are in camp all litter and trash is cleaned away and all scraps of meat bones and
                                    such like are taken a way and burned or hurried it is bound to be done there is so
                                    much filth about a camp where so many soldiers are that we could not live if it were
                                    not cleaned up therefore it is cleaned thoroughly every day regular and the men have
                                    to keep their cloths clean and their bodys too and their heads combed our army is
                                    quite healthy hear now and I believe it is a general thing all over the whole union
                                    Army in all climates land and water according to all accounts in the newspapers we
                                    are in camp yet taking things easy as possible we get papers every day I see from
                                    the papers that Grant's Army is getting furlows since the taking of
                                    vicksburg I see that Kimbal and General Sullivan has a furlow and have gone home to

                                    when they first started out 2 of the best Regiments in the united States Service we
                                    done such good fighting that the Colonels were both made generals and sent west they
                                    are both good fighting men they will have a good time in Ind. I reckon, there are no
                                    furlows given from this army we are to weak to spair any men at present the way we
                                    are placed we are holding a large scope of country and <pb n="371" id="VAA4025-031-4-107"/> our lines are long and have to be guarded closely to
                                    prevent our supplies from being interrupted though I dont think we will do anything
                                    only hold what we have got for awhile the most of the Regts are going to be filled
                                    up with drafted men we are looking for the men now they have been gone after them
                                    some 2 weeks I dont know what they will do with our regt though I suppose they will
                                    consolidate it in to about 4 companys and muster the rest of the officers out as
                                    they are not drafting enough men in Ind. to fill up the Ind. regts. I dont know who
                                    will be mustered out Nicholas has a commission for capt and Rogers for 1st Lt. and
                                    Dunlap for 2nd Lt. and I am first sergt. but they have refuse[d] to muster the men
                                    on these last commissions and ordered the men to take their former positions and so
                                    it stands yours til death</p>

                                    rigging that is crowded around that partly hides it from us New york city is to the

                                    north of us and camden New jersey is to the west of us so we can see a town any way
                                    that we look and we cant go to any of them without crossing water and deep water at
                                    that Brooklin is partly Built in the water it is but a short distance from our

                                    water to drink there is ships and boats and vessels of all kinds steaming and
                                    sailing through the harbor all the time there is a camp meeting across in jersey and

                                    going on and I think that us being hear will keep the peace without having to use

                                    and I hope this will find enjoying the same blessing you will see from the heading
                                    of my letter that we are on the sacred soil of <placeName>

                                    does not surprise me much for it is out of the question for us to stay any place
                                    where there is no fighting to do we have been in the front ever since the war
                                    commenced and I guess we will be until it is over but I am in hopes that will not be

                                    perhaps fort Moltry [Moultrie] is battered down by this time and there is now
                                    nothing to hinder our men from taking Charlston or Burning it to ashes and in a very
                                    short time and all there is to be done is for the army of <placeName>

                                    well we had a fine time we saw a great deal of the world we spent the most of our
                                    time in East new york and stoped a day and night in the city of Brooklin and marched
                                    through the city of new york the people treated us very kind and expecialy the
                                    citizens of Brooklin and more especialy the Ladies were very respectfully friendly
                                    and sociable there was no disturbance concerning the draft while we stayed new york
                                    is a large and a fine city but I like Brooklin a little the best from what I saw

                                    </placeName> Culpepper is a right smart little town though it is Secesh and
                                    considerable deserted we are right Slap up against the rebs we can see their camp
                                    from ours we was out on piquet night before last and yesterday we was close to the
                                    rebs and got corn out of their rosten ear patch they did not shoot at us nor we did
                                    not shoot at them there has been considerable Skirmishing out hear but our cavelry
                                    has done the most of it they have been driving the rebels back for several days and
                                    we have been following up there is only a small creek between us and the rebs now
                                    they are on a range of mountains just the other side of the creek but I dont think
                                    there is a great many of them there we expect to march every hour but I dont know
                                    whether we are going to move on the rebel camps or not Some think we will have a
                                    fight hear and Some think we will not we are across the <geogName>Rappahannock
                                    River</geogName> and we are in about 5 miles of the Rappidan we are a long ways
                                    above fredricksburg and chancellorsville and farther out in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> though we are not much nearer richmond we are facing more in the
                                    direction of Gordonville which is not a great ways from hear I dont know exactly how
                                    far. there was 2 deserters shot hear day before yesterday it was an awful sight to
                                    see I have saw many men shot and I saw a man hanging to a tree but he was a <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-031-4-110"/> spy and did not affect me but very little but
                                    to see men marched to their graves with their coffins carried before them and placed
                                    near the grave and the men set on them and a cloth tied over their face and shot to
                                    death is the most serious sight of all there was 20 men shot in this army day before
                                    yesterday for desertion these 2 was in our division and belonged to the 14th <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                                    </placeName> Regt the others were in different divisions and corps and I suppose
                                    were shot according to orders in the presence of their own divisions well I have a
                                    heap to write more than I could write in a week I cannot attempt to commence half of
                                    what I want to tell you there is one thing a going on now hear that I dont know what
                                    to say about it or do in it and that is about reenlisting for the war our Regiment
                                    is small and will be consolidated by putting 2 and 3 companys togeather and muster
                                    out all the spair officers and Sergts but the way things is there is no prospect of
                                    me getting out before my time is up and I dont know whether that will be the 23d of
                                    April or the 7th of June next but it is one or the other I would not mind staying my
                                    time out hear if we was to remain in companys as we are but this we cannot do I
                                    cannot explain to you by writing what I want you to understand our regt is less than
                                    500 and there can be no more promotions made in it Leevi Dunlap has a commission as
                                    2d Lieut but he cannot get Mustered on it and of course it does him no good in the
                                    way of pay I have been first Sergt for a long time but I have never got any pay as
                                    first Sergt. nor wont unless dunlap gets mustered as Lieutenant and if this
                                    consolidation takes place</p>

                                    severe fighting all along the lines that evening but we helt our lines, thomas
                                    Clements was wounded in the knee Logan T. Fraim and James Sanders Slightly in the
                                    finger. Berry Noland Mortally in the back I dont know whether he is alive yet or
                                    not. we lay near the rebs all night some fireing going on all the time and on the
                                    6th we had hard fighting we advanced on them and drove them about a mile and they
                                    got reinforcements and drove us back some but we rallied and had a very hard <pb n="375" id="VAA4025-031-4-111"/> fight in the woods I dont know the name of the
                                    pace [place] yet only the battle in the wilderness in this part of the fight I was
                                    wounded and went out of the fight and went back to the Hospital and stayed all night
                                    and next day there was a powerful sight of men wounded though there was not so very
                                    many killed, after I left the field the rebs drove our men backmen back and charged
                                    on our breastworks and took apart of them but our Brigade charged and took them back
                                    again and killed a good many rebels on the 7th there was not much fighting the rebs
                                    fell back and the Hospital was moved to Predricksburg and my wound being light not
                                    very light either for it was my belt and belt plate that saved my life it busted the
                                    plate and stoped against the leather but it bruised my belly considerably but I came
                                    back to the Regt and on the 8th was in the fight again George W. Waggoner and Robert
                                    A fergerson was wounded but not very bad and on the 9th we had another fight we made
                                    a charge on the rebel Breastworks but was repulsed our Regiment run like the devil
                                    but they are not to blame they went to their works and found that they could not get
                                    over them and of course they did not want to Stay there and be shot down Oscar Hall
                                    was wounded slightly in the hip I cannot give all the particulars we have been
                                    fighting every day on the 12th we charged the rebels Breastworks and took them and
                                    18 cannon stand of colors and 8000 prisoners and burried any quantity, of them they
                                    are falling back slowly but as fast as they can we are now on the road from
                                    Fredricksburg to richmond and we are getting reinforcements and we are going to
                                    clean them out General grant is a going to stay with them there is no fighting yet
                                    this morning but I think it will commence soon our men are closing up on the rebs
                                    our loss has been heavy we started with 22 men in our company and we now have 10 but
                                    we have but one killed yet that we know of that is Wm Harris, henry Bussinger was
                                    wounded and I suppose the rebs got him the rest is all safe I heard from George
                                    Fraim yesterday he was about the hospital in the feild and the rebel cavelry is
                                    watching around our rear and it is dangerous to be safe your husband</p>

                        <salute>My Dear Wife</salute>
                        <p>I received your letter of the 4th inst. 3 days ago but did not Make up my mind to
                                    write until now. I would have wrote yesterday but the letter would have laid in the
                                    office until tomorrow morning any how and so I put off writing til now. I have give
                                    up the idea of getting a furlough to come home this time the Doctor says my wound is
                                    not bad enough for a furlough he cant give furloughs to any that he thinks will get
                                    well in less than 30 days and he thinks I will be well in a week or 2 and I think so
                                    too but I did not tell him so the fact is I am about well now that is I can walk
                                    about very well and I expect I will be well enough for duty in another week you said
                                    for me to not wait for money for I might Die. I have got to be killed or get
                                    somthing the matter with <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-031-4-112"/> me yet before I die. I
                                    was in the city last thursday and got my pay that is my monthly pay up to the last
                                    of April, there is 50 Dollar Bounty Due me now that I did not get because it was not
                                    put on the Boll, it cant be helped now I will get it next pay day. I have plenty of
                                    money now so you need not be uneasy about me on that score I have been treated well
                                    by all about the Hospital it is about 2 miles from hear in to the city, the Indiana
                                    agency tells me I can have anything that I want to eat or wear they have given me a
                                    shirt a pair of Drawers and socks and some oranges and caned peaches to eat. they
                                    are many things Brought to the Hospital for the Soldiers such as Strawberrys oranges
                                    lemons and jellys but those who are wounded bad Suffer much and many die with pain
                                    and Mortification and Lock jaw and some by bleeding but of course every body has to
                                    die some time, well I suppose the old 14th Indiana will be at home before you get
                                    this their time was out on the 7th inst. I expected to see them the day I was in the
                                    city but they did not come up that day I heard that they come friday but I did not
                                    get to see any of them I heard that they left the Recruits and Veterans in the
                                    Breast works towards <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and they was not transfered or any thing else done with them well I
                                    guess I will be with them in a short time again I saw Lieutenant andrews of Co B. in
                                    the city he said he was going Back to stay with the Veterans and it was rumored that
                                    we would get a Battery but I dont know what will be done yet there has been awful
                                    hard fighting and we have lost many men but I think we are a going to be victorious
                                    all the time to the end and I think the end is not far off I hope I will be as lucky
                                    as I have been all along and come out safe I have been very lucky I have been struck
                                    twice in this last Campaign and one half inch Difference each time would have killed
                                    me almost suddenly I want to send my belt and pants home if I can and then you can
                                    see how narrow was my escape. I will send you some money by express to Loogootee I
                                    think it will get there by Wednesday or thursday write to me as soon as you get this
                                    I will be apt to get the letter before I leave hear I must close hoping you are all
                                    well I remain yours</p>

                        <salute>My Dear Wife</salute>
                        <p>I received your letter of the 21st yesterday evening. I was glad to hear that you was
                                    all well, and that you had got the money I sent to you. I am in good health and my
                                    wound is about sound and well and I will soon be ready to go to the army again the
                                    doctor is very easy with me and would have sent me to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to day if I had said so as they are trying to make room hear for the
                                    fresh wounded that comes from the army I told him I would soon be well he left it
                                    all to my own honor he said he did not want to send any away that would be well in
                                    less than a month I told him I thought I would be well in less than a month so he
                                    said I could stay hear til I got ready to go to the army I thought it was no use for
                                    me to go to another Hospital and have nothing the matter with me I might be sent
                                    back in disgrace. So I will do my duty and trust to providence for safety I heard
                                    yesterday that what was left of the 14th was put in the 20th Indiana Regt I suppose
                                    that will suit the boys as well as any way. the 20th Regiments time will be out some
                                    time in july and I understand they are a going to make 2 companys out of what was
                                    left of the 14th and 6 companys out of what will be left of the 20th and keep them
                                    togeather as a Regt of 8 companys. I think this arrangement will suit very well,
                                    there will be officers lacking and will give our boys a chance. I think I will write
                                    them a letter to day and let them know that I am going to help them out in a short
                                    time. I dont know exactly how to direct though they are in Companys E and B of the
                                    20 Ind. so I cant miss them far to direct to the 20th Regt Ind vol 2nd Corps there
                                    is one officer of our regt with our boys and I suppose the rest will be made out of
                                    our boys for 2 companys. well I have been to breakfast and the mail goes from hear
                                    to the city at 8 oclock and I must hurry up I dont know whether the mail leaves the
                                    city to day or not I wrote a letter to sis yesterday before I got yours you said the
                                    noveletts had not come I sent one to sis and some papers with it and I sent one to

                        <salute>Dear Wife</salute>
                        <p>I take my pen in hand this morning to let you know that I am well and hearty hoping
                                    this will find you enjoying the same blessing. I received your letter of the 2nd
                                    inst yesterday it got hear on the 5th but I was in the city and did not come back
                                    until yesterday morning. So I did not get it til about 12 oclock and then I was put
                                    under arrest 3 hours for staying over my time so I did not feel much like writing
                                    until I was released, the fellow that was with me was put in the guard house for 3
                                    hours, me being a Sergt kept me out of the guard house, all the punishment I got was
                                    to stay by my bed and not have the privalege of going out or walking around any til
                                    the 3 hours was up. I could have wrote but the punishment was so light I thought I
                                    would take the full benefit of it so I kept cool I am all right this morning only my
                                    hand trembles considerable but I guess you can make out to read the words if they
                                    are a little crooked. I had a very good 4th of July in the city on the 5th. it was a
                                    dull 4th hear we had a drink of ale for a treat, well I expressed my belt and pants
                                    and my old blouse and an old shirt the sanitary commission give me that I had no use
                                    for. I allowed to get some other things and send but I could get no box handy so I
                                    just roled the cloths up around the belt and tied a cord to them and let them rip I
                                    guess they will go Safe I expressed them on the 5th and they will be at Loogootee by
                                    the time you get this or before the expressage will be $1.25 cts. I
                                    thought I would not pay it til they got home and if they go safe you can pay it
                                    there when you get them, you can do as you please with the cloths as they will not
                                    be much use for me to ware perhaps you can fix them for willy. I want you to take
                                    particular care of the belt, as it Saved my life I would not take gold for it. the
                                    hook that fastens the belt is in the cap pouch and you can see that when it was
                                    buckled the leather was under the plate and the leather stoped the ball from going
                                    through my bowels well I am Still hear in Hospital yet I was mustered hear for 2
                                    months pay and I think I will Stay til I get pay, if they pay off as soon as they
                                    generally do. I dont know whether I will get my bounty hear or not but I suppose I
                                    will but if I dont I will get enough to make out with til I do get it. I can get it
                                    by going to the pay master general and getting a certificate of my enlistment which
                                    I can do if necessary the Soldiers wages is raised now. from the 1st of may

                                    and as soon as I get pay I will apply to go to the army I would go right away but I

                                    could not come there was a part of the 6th corps marched hear and advanced on the

                                    the army on the 12 inst. and our Corps (the 2nd) was on the move we got on boats and
                                    came up the river [James] and got off on the opposite side. I wrote to you about it
                                    in my other letter.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> we advanced out and up the river til we
                                    came to the rebs and where we had some works, we have a Battery at this point and

                                    other side of the river on Butlers lines and towards Petersburg, there are a great
                                    many rumers going but I dont know how the thing is going yet but I think our side
                                    has a long ways the best of the bargain we have got 3 rebel generals this move one
                                    was a cavelry Brig. Gen. was killed and buried at a house in 10 steps of our camp
                                    and was taken up yesterday and delivered to the Rebs who came after him with a flag
                                    of truce we have had an easy time this move so far. there has been very hard and
                                    bloody fighting along the lines, there has been a few shells throwed at us but none
                                    of us have been hurt yet our battery and a gun boat that lays in the river close by
                                    keeps the rebs close in their holes we drove the rebs off from one line of works

                                    was getting them off as they was between our line and the rebs. we had a warm little
                                    skirmish but none of us got hurt I was struck by a ball on my cartridge box just as
                                    we was starting back but as luck would have it I was not hurt the least by it. the
                                    guns and ammunition was got off safe and we came back to our old position and we are
                                    still hear there is not much firing this morning since day light and there is no
                                    signs of a fight at the point but I expect there will be fighting for several days

                                    well and hearty and received your letter of the 12th inst. this morning. I was glad
                                    to hear from you. your letter was 6 days on the road, though if our letters all go
                                    that quick we can hear from each other once a week I have nothing new to write at

                                    bullets are whistling about our quarters all the time, one cant step out or walk
                                    about any place without a ball whizzing past his head, there has been 2 or 3 of our
                                    regt wounded on the line since I wrote to you before and there was one killed in his
                                    quarters Some 4 days ago. but none of our company have been hurt Since, the last man
                                    that was killed belonged to Co "E." and was one of the old 14th
                                    boys George E. Fraim belongs to that company, he is well, he got a letter from his
                                    father this morning and is answering it to day. it is So curious to See how the
                                    piquets fire at each other day and night that it would put any body to their studys
                                    to think about it. the way we are fixed we have a good line of Breast works where we
                                    camp and they are built high and we can walk along behind them and not be exposed to
                                    the bullets at all but then when we get back from our works on a little higher
                                    ground the bullets come close, well the piquet line is not So good a protection it
                                    is out a couple of hundred yards from our mane works and is only little pits dug and
                                    the dirt throwed out that makes a Shelter for a few men to hide behind, and these
                                    pits is some 20 feet a part and no ditch cut from one to the other So the men are
                                    bound to Stick close to their pit to be safe they are Safe enough when they are
                                    laying in their pits the bullets cant tuch them, but between the works and the
                                    piquet line there is nothing to shelter the men going out and coming in. but for
                                    some cause or other both sides Stops fireing every evening about a half hour by Sun
                                    and dont commence again til all hands are ready this is the time we Send out new men
                                    and them that is out Comes in the Rebs do the same as we do I suppose they are glad
                                    to stop fireing for they could not relieve their men without being Shot going out
                                    and in. well when the boys begin to halloo to cease firing the whole of both sides
                                    raise up and have a jolification and one evening one of our boys went over to their
                                    line and Swaped papers with them, well when every thing is ready they call out get
                                    in your holes and they lay down and Shoot away all night I send out 5 men from my
                                    company every night and they take from 100 to 150 rounds of ammunition and five a
                                    peice—all they have, our boys some of them come in through the day for
                                    water and coffee while the Shooting is going on this is a little dangerous but none
                                    of them have been hurt yet. they have got a ditch dug to go out in now most all the
                                    way. we keep a little ahead of the rebs all the time, they keep fireing to keep us
                                    from slipping up on them again I must close hoping this may find you well and that I
                                    may Soon be with you</p>

                        <salute>Dear Wife</salute>
                        <p>I received your kind letter of the 18th inst this morning it found me well and hearty
                                    and I hope this will find you and my Dear little Children all enjoying good health.
                                    I have nothing very Strange to write to you at present we are Still laying along the
                                    front line before Petersburg <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-031-4-118"/> and our Sharp
                                    Shooters and the rebs keep fireing most of the time though there is but very few
                                    hurt on either Side. Sergt Robert Deyo was killed Some 3 days ago he belonged to my
                                    company and was one of the old 14th Veterans, he was on piquet and was coming in to
                                    get Some dinner while the fireing was going on. and walked along in plain Sight of
                                    the rebs and they Shot him through he died instantly he was a good Soldier and his
                                    death is much lamented by the company he was reckless in walking around in Sight of
                                    the Rebs and giving them Such a fair chance to Shoot him when he could have went
                                    concealed by going a little way round, though he was always that turn he had no
                                    fears and escaped So far but one bullet at last done the fatal work, there has been
                                    some fighting along our lines Some days back but I have not heard the truth of what
                                    has been done for certain yet but I have heard heavy cannonading on our right
                                    towards the James River along Butlers lines Butler is working in to the rebs he is
                                    digging a Canal across a point on the James River to run gunboats in and it is
                                    rumered that he has cut the Rail Road between <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and Petersburg and that he had a big fight and the Rebs charged on his
                                    line Several times and was repulsed and drove back with heavy loss each time. So we
                                    are gaining on the Rebs every where all the time we will Soon have them pined to the
                                    wall Sheridan has cut them all to peices in the <geogName>Shanendoah
                                    Valley</geogName> and was Still cutting away on the peices the last we have heard of
                                    him a good fight or two more will make a finish of the Rebellion and I dont think it
                                    will be long til we have it. the rebs have only one Rail Road now leading from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and we are very near having that in two places, to wit Sheridan Driving
                                    the Rebs from the valley back to linchburg will get hold on the Road there if he is
                                    successful which he will be unless Lee sends reinforcements from Petersburg to him
                                    and if he does that grant will pitch in to him hear and make a chassa [<hi rend="i">chassé</hi>] to the left and get the road near <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                                    </placeName> or Petersburg if not the places too and when we get the road we have
                                    them cut off to starve or smo[ke] out or come out and fight us where we will have
                                    the advantage everything is working well and I think the war is near an end and if
                                    old abe is elected president again I think the rebs would give up and quit trying to
                                    fight any longer All that keeps them holding out now is the Secessionist in the
                                    north thinking they will get a president that will settle with them and give them
                                    their independence and divide the union I think there has been too much blood Spilt
                                    for that I must close we Signed our pay Rolls to day and are to be paid tomorrow
                                    there is Still talk of us coming home to the election to vote</p>

                                    and keep dark I guess they can See now which side is the Strongest and who is right
                                    &amp; who is rong. <placeName>

                                    </placeName> is elected by the largest Majority of any president Since <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, this does me good to know that there is So many union men in the north
                                    and that the traitors are So few I cant call them any thing else for they are going
                                    right against what the Soldiers are fighting for but I think it is time for them to
                                    give up the ghost, the rebellion is bound to be put down and if it cant come down no
                                    other way it will be put down by force the last man in the Southern confederacy will
                                    be Swept from the face of the earth rather than give them independance over us of
                                    the north and the union. I say hurah for <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                                    </placeName> he is the man for the times the Soldiers are in good Spirits they all
                                    think we are Sure to win without much fighting and that the war will Soon be over
                                    but it may last Sometime yet for the weather is bad now and there can not be much
                                    done though we are not Settled we are expecting to have Some kind of a move hear
                                    Soon we have been held in readiness to move for Several days and we are looking for
                                    Somthing big to turn up in this army the canal on the James River is read to blow
                                    out and let the water through and the fleet is ready to run through the army in
                                    readiness to move and Shermans army is on the move and there will be a hell of a
                                    dust raised Somewhere before long but we dont know where, to day is thanksgiving day
                                    yesterday we got turkys cakes pies &amp; apples enough to make us 2 good meals
                                    it was a made up dinner for the army by the citisens of the united States and the
                                    Sanitary Commission and was the best dinner we ever got for there was plenty it does
                                    the Soldiers good to know that the people think enough of them to Send them a dinner
                                    hurah for the union and the women well you Said that Jerry and Wm <placeName>

                                    I allowed he would be excused on account of his eyes I would like to know whether

                                    take duck fitts about it but it is all on account of the war and they will have to
                                    stand it there is a risk to run and Somebody has to run it. you said that benny was
                                    at home playing off Sick he had better be careful and not Stay over his time or he
                                    will be taken up and have to Serve his time out without any pay if nothing worse. I

                        <salute>My Dear Wife</salute>
                        <p>I received a letter from you this morning dated January 22d. it has been on the road
                                    almost a month, but it is no wonder by the round it went, it was put in the rong
                                    mail Sack Somewhere and took the rong track. I dont know where all it went to but I
                                    see it was remailed at Savana Georgia. I Suppose it has been all through the western
                                    army before it took the right track well I had a letter from you of a later date and
                                    wrote an answer to you day before yesterday we was building new houses then and it
                                    was very Cold and rainy but we have got them built now and it is fine weather we had
                                    a little rain last night but tis very nice and warm to day we was out yesterday to
                                    See another deserter shot he had been convicted of cowardice and of desertion and
                                    was Sentenced to be Shot to death by musketry and the Sentence was carried in to
                                    effect yesterday he belonged to the 124th new york regt and to our Brigade and of
                                    course we had to witness the Scene he was marched around with music and his coffin
                                    along the lines to his grave and a detail of 8 men Shot him as he Sat on his coffin
                                    he fell back but Still Showed life when 2 other men went close and Shot him through
                                    the heart and the Ceremony was over and we come to our quarters and rested to day we
                                    had our monthly inspection and things went off tolerable well only Some of our men
                                    did not have their Knapsacks packed as they Should be and the inspector found fault
                                    but Still I dont think this will injure me in any way as I was not in command of the
                                    company to day as Cole our captain was present and Bossed the job I have had
                                    inspections before this when I had to attend to the company and be Responsible for
                                    their appearence and conduct in general but by the G. D. S. I always had them to
                                    come out Right and got the praise for it and the good will of the company and all
                                    concerned there was an order that no furloughs or leaves of absence would be given
                                    to Companys who would not make a good appearence on inspection and they would have
                                    to be inspected til they got everything Right but if they was a little rong to day I
                                    think it will not interfere with me I have made application to come home and I think
                                    I will get to come about the last of this month or the first of next at the out side
                                    I did not put in on the acct of Sickness but it is on business that will do just as
                                    well I think if it does not this last letter I got from you that Stated Jerry was
                                    sick will do me for another so if my first application fails I will put in the
                                    second so I am bound to come if I live and the order holds out long enough George E.
                                    fraim is coming home and I will send this by him I am well hoping this will find you
                                    enjoying the same blessing</p>

            <p>The first of these two volumes is Vol. XXIV and the second is Vol. XXVI of the <hi rend="i">Collections</hi> of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> State Historical Library. In the "Statistical Series," the volumes
                    are II and III, respectively. The second of the two volumes came from the press in 1934, the first
                    in 1935. The volume most recently published presents the data gathered in the federal census of 1810
                    plus that compiled in the state census of 1818. The other volume presents the information gathered
                    together by those who took the state census of 1820. Matter from the federal census of 1820 is used
                    only by way of comparison or contrast in various instances. It is expected that the returns of the
                    federal census of 1820 will "also be printed before many years."</p>
            <p>The volume devoted to the census returns of 1810 and 1818 (XXIV of the <hi rend="i">Collections</hi>), includes an "Introduction" (pp. ix-xxii) which presents a
                    brief history of census taking in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The data for 1810, occupies fifty-three pages (pp. 1–53). The returns for
                    1818 occupy one hundred fifty-five pages (pp. 55–210). An index for each census has been
                    prepared and added to the census data (1910, pp. 213–224; 1918, pp. 225–329).
                    In this volume three maps are reproduced from L. L. Emmerson, <hi rend="i">Counties of <placeName>

               </hi>, showing county boundary lines for 1809, 1818, and 1819. A fourth map
                    indicating the extent of settlement in 1818 is reproduced from S. J. Buck, <hi rend="i">

            </p>
            <p>The volume devoted to the data collected in the state census of 1820 (XXVI of the <hi rend="i">Collections</hi>) presents the matter county by county pertaining to the nineteen counties of <placeName>

                    </placeName> at that time (pp. 1–360). The remainder of the book (pp. 363–466)
                    presents a complete index of the names listed in the nineteen counties.</p>
            <p>There can be no doubt as to the great value of such publications, and the Trustees of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> State Historical Library are to be highly commended for the undertaking as are also
                    Miss Norton and her advisers. The information contained in the two volumes is valuable, as the
                    editor states in <pb n="388" id="VAA4025-031-4-124"/> her "Introduction", not only
                    because "the names of hundreds of pioneers otherwise forgotten" are preserved, but
                    because a basis is provided "for studies in population movements in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>". Since there is no more fascinating phase of American history than the
                    movement of population, affecting old areas as well as new and tremendously influencing the trends
                    and currents of the nation's development, the verdict of historical students in regard to
                    the two volumes will certainly be highly favorable.</p>

                        <salute>To the Editor of <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>:</salute>
                        <p>Referring to your comments in the September, 1935, issue of <hi rend="i">Indiana
                                        Magazine of History</hi> (pp. 256–258) concerning my article
                                    "Wet Lands and the Hoosier Stereotype" (<hi rend="i">
                              <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Review</hi>, June,
                                    1935), I should like to offer one or two points by way of explanation. The term
                                    "stereotype" is used in the article in the sense proposed by Mr.
                                    Walter Lippmann—a fixed mental pattern or image which may or may not be
                                    wholly in accord with the facts which it is supposed to represent. (This definition
                                    is based on Part III of <hi rend="i">Public Opinion</hi>, <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, 1922.) As a prevailing popular impression it may abuse the minds which
                                    entertain it and it may represent a gross misunderstanding <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-031-4-125"/> and warping of actual facts and conditions. Thus the
                                    existence of a stereotype—a thing of the mind—is one matter:
                                    its justice is another.</p>
                        <p>My article, I believe, carries data which definitely indicate the existence of a
                                    Hoosier stereotype in the minds of peoples to the eastward of Indiana, at least
                                    during the generation preceding the Civil War. That is all I attempt to demonstrate
                                    by this part of the argument. That the stereotype did not reliably represent the
                                    facts my paper suggests in more than one place and in more than one way. Indeed, the
                                    fact that the state was holding its place reasonably well as to population, which is
                                    the principal assertion of your criticism, only causes us to wonder why Indiana
                                    should have borne the reputation it did and to wonder at the sense of handicap under
                                    which representative citizens of the state seemed to live. In brief, I believe there
                                    are in the history of Indiana, as well as of other places and regions, important, if
                                    intangible, factors which census and representation figures do not disclose.
                                    Although you declare that I have produced "no evidence of value"
                                    concerning a "Hoosier Stereotype" I am content to leave decision
                                    on the point to the generality of my readers.</p>
                        <p>If I may make another point without being charged with the offense of over-neatness
                                    it would be this: in the latter part of my paper where I consider the respects in
                                    which Indiana's society still reflects the conditions of the
                                    state's settlement, I intend it as a discussion of the effects of
                                    geographical factors upon the state's society without any particular
                                    reference to stereotypes. It may be merely naive to add that the writer was a little
                                    surprised at the path over which his studies led him and that he had no intention of
                                    defaming his native state. Yet there appeared to him a unity of cause behind the
                                    several parts of his argument which justified setting them forth in the way he did.</p>

            <head>Comment</head>
            <p>It seems proper here and now to express the deep sense of appreciation which the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> feels toward those who have supported the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> by their
                    contributions during the seven and one-half years that he has carried the responsibilities of
                    editorship. Not only have many persons submitted papers which he has been glad to publish, but,
                    almost without exception, the work of the editor has been kindly received by contributors.</p>
            <p>Having said the above, it may be worth while to add that all who turn in manuscripts, directly or
                    indirectly, with a view to having them published, should first examine articles of a similar nature
                    that have previously appeared. The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, like most
                    historical journals, attempts to maintain, within reasonable limits, certain rules in regard to
                    paragraphing, punctuation, capitalization, and arrangement of footnotes. There seems to be no good
                    reason why most persons sending articles to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> should not first go over
                    them to bring them into harmony with papers published in earlier issues as to matters of form. For
                    example, any contributer may easily discover that the names of authors appearing in footnotes are
                    not printed with the surname first. Any author, no matter how much of an amateur, should feel it a
                    duty and a privilege to make a final inspection of every paragraph, indeed of every sentence, before
                    consigning a paper to the mails, to improve the English when improvement is possible. Certainly,
                    great care should be taken to eliminate all gramatical errors and all errors as to historical facts
                    that can be, discovered before the manuscript is permitted to leave the hands of the author.</p>
            <p>As in the past, the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> desires to receive historical articles valuable in
                    content. When necessary, he will not refuse to do a considerable amount of editorial work on a
                    manuscript containing important historical information. No editor of a state or local historical
                    journal can afford to reject good material because the English of the manuscript is not satisfactory
                    or because the requirements of good form have not been met. To do so would mean that some good
                    history would be forever lost. However, the writer of a paper, even before submitting it to the
                    hard-working editor of a state historical <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-031-4-127"/> quarterly, should
                    feel a keen responsibility to perfect it to the best of his ability.</p>
            <p>An all too common notion of the young historical investigator preparing to do his first piece of
                    writing is that nothing ever written on his subject of a secondary character amounts to anything.
                    This would not be so bad if he could live happily without spreading his discovery, but, unless very
                    modest, he feels impelled to tell the world about it and to stress it too soon and too often. Even
                    so he should, perhaps, be pardoned more readily than the experienced writer of history who cites the
                    special monographs and articles of those who have in his estimation been admitted to the cult,
                    whether their work is scholarly or not, while he carelessly or ignorantly fails to notice the
                    studies published by more humble but more capable and more original students. It should not be
                    possible to make such comments relative to the guild of historical workers, but unfortunately there
                    are seemingly scholarly men who do not judge others by merit alone. The truth is, nevertheless, that
                    all who have really caught the spirit of scholarship are above sham or pretense and are able and
                    anxious to recognize and welcome genuine light from whatever source it may emanate.</p>

                    </hi>, December 13–14, are earlier than the time for mailing this issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> to subscribers, but later than the time for printing. It is therefore
                    impossible to publish an account of the meeting and these comments are written in advance. The
                    Indiana Historical Society and the Indiana History Teachers' Association provide the
                    programs for the regular sessions of the Conference. One of these sessions (10:00 A.M. Saturday)
                    occurs simultaneously with two other separate meetings of Genealogists and Archeologists. The
                    Indiana Pioneer Society holds its annual banquet on Saturday evening with President Chauncey S.

                    Section on Saturday, Governor Paul V. McNutt gives an address. On Saturday morning the teachers of
                    history in the colleges of the state breakfast together. These informal meetings of an unorganized
                    group <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-031-4-128"/> are of much value to those who attend, mainly because
                    there are no set programs, no officers, no committees, no dues and no obligations resting on the
                    college teachers who gravitate to the place of meeting.</p>
