                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> is a book about Edward Eggleston; about the people, great and small with whom
                    he held close relations during a life of singularly varied activity; about the things that
                    interested him, the causes in which his superb enthusiasm was enlisted, the work he did in the
                    world, the spirit in which he did it, and other matters that connect themselves with him in the
                    minds of those who knew him best.</p>
                <p>It is not a biography, in the ordinary sense of that term, though it relates all of fact concerning
                    the life of its subject, that a formal biography would include. It is rather a study of the man, his
                    work, and his surroundings at various periods of his life, as these things are remembered by the

                <p>One day in the early summer of 1902, after Edward began fully to realize, as his physicians did not,
                    that the end of his life was drawing near, he somewhat painfully made his way through the woodlands,
                    from his Lake George Cottage to minea few hundred yards distantand for the last time in his life sat
                    down in my porch. He was extremely feeble, I remember; it was painful for him to walk, and even
                    rising from a chair or seating himself in one was a matter of some difficulty. But his life long
                    cheerfulness of spirit endured, and he faced death with a calm mind and quite uncomplainingly. A
                    year or two before the visit of which I am now writing he had been stricken in a way that threatened
                    his early end, and writing to me of the fact he had said:</p>
                <p>&quot;I am content and happy. 1 have had a life of enjoyable activity. I have been permitted to
                    render some service to my generation. I have lived. If the end is near I have <pb id="VAA2342-009"
                        n="11"/> neither reason nor disposition to complain. On the contrary, I shall be happy to the
                    end and in the end.&quot;</p>
                <p>As he sat there in my porch on the occasion of his last visit, looking out upon the calmly beautiful
                    bay, he turned to me and said:</p>
                <p>&quot;Geordie&quot;he always had a pet name for every one whom he loved, and from boyhood
                    this had been his pet name for me &quot; Geordie, after I die some of the publishers may want to
                    print a little book about me. If they do, I want you to write the book. You are the only person
                    living who has known me all my life, and you have known me with a degree of sympathetic intimacy
                    impossible to any other. You have known all my purposes and plans and ambitions; you have shared
                    many of them and you have understood even those that you did not share. We were little children
                    together, boys together, young men together, men of middle age together, and now we <pb
                        id="VAA2342-010" n="12"/> are growing old together. Another thing: in pretty nearly every
                    article that has ever been written concerning me there have been mistakes made and misapprehensions,
                    until many persons who know me only through my writings, actually think I was born in poverty and
                    reared in an ignorance like that of the characters in &quot;The Hoosier
                    Schoolmaster,&quot;an ignorance from which I am supposed to have escaped by my own exertions. If
                    you write of me you will correct all that. Anyhow, 1 want you to write the book if any book is to be
                    written.&quot;</p>
                <p>Thus I received the commission which I here endeavor lovingly to fulfil. In doing so I shall not
                    closely follow any preconceived order of narrative or comment. Where the mention of matters
                    connected with one part of Edward Eggleston&apos;s life brings to my mind interesting matters
                    relating to any other part of it, I shall not hesitate to make the transition for the sake of a
                    better and truer unity than any that a rigid adherence <pb id="VAA2342-011" n="13"/> to the
                    chronological order could possibly secure.</p>
                <p>On the title page of this volume I call my brother &quot;The First of the Hoosiers.&quot; I
                    do so because he was the very first to perceive and utilize in literature the picturesqueness of the
                    Hoosier life and character, the first to appreciate the poetic and romantic possibilities of that
                    life and to invite others to share with him his enjoyment of its humor and his admiration for its
                    sturdy manliness.</p>
                <p>Other men of rare literary gifts have followed in his footsteps in this richly flowering field, but
                    he was the first to venture upon it. He was the pathfinder. Until he wrote &quot;The Hoosier
                    Schoolmaster,&quot; and moved the readers of more than one nation to laughter and tears, nobody
                    had ever made the smallest attempt to turn the Hoosier life and character to any artistic account.</p>
                <p>He selected that field for his work in fiction with deliberation and earnest conviction. <pb
                        id="VAA2342-012" n="14"/> He reminded me at the time that the Dutch painters never produced
                    anything of value in art until they ceased to go to Italy for their subjects and began to paint
                    their own homely Dutch interiors and landscapes and people instead. It was his fixed conviction that
                    whether in the graphic or in the literary art no man can do his best work unless he chooses for his
                    subject a life which he thoroughly knows.</p>
                <p>And Edward Eggleston knew the ruder side of the Hoosier life and character all the better for the
                    reason that in his childhood and youth he had been &quot;in it but not of it,&quot; He had
                    seen it in perspective. He always had something better in his own home and associations, by which to
                    measure the rudeness that showed itself all about him.</p>
                <p>The peculiarities of the Hoosier dialect interested him chiefly because of their wide departure from
                    the good English which alone he heard at home. When he wrote &quot;The Hoosier
                    Schoolmaster&quot; he was in his <pb id="VAA2342-013" n="15"/> early thirties, and had for years
                    been a dweller in great cities. But his memory of the life, the character and the dialect that had
                    so intensely interested him in his boyhood was vivid and accurate in an extreme degree, and so
                    effectively did he present them in literature that &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster,&quot;
                    after being serially published in many periodicals, outsold any novel of its time in book form, and
                    in new editions it continues to sell better to-day than most new books do. It attracted attention
                    abroad also. It was translated into French and published in a noted French periodical. It was
                    translated into German, the translator using what we call &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot; in
                    lieu of the Hoosier dialect. Concerning the French translation, the Rev. Washington Gladden wrote in
                    the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> that he had not yet seen it, but was eager for a sight of it for
                    the reason that he strongly desired to know the classic French form of &quot;Gee Whillicky
                    Crickets!&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-014" n="16"/>
                <p>In making effective literary use of the Hoosier life, character and dialect, Edward Eggleston was as
                    truly the pioneer as Bret Harte was in doing the like for the mining camps. It is in everyway
                    proper, therefore, that I call him &quot;The First of the Hoosiers.&quot;</p>

                <head type="subtitle">A Little Love Story and Other Matters.</head>
                <p>M<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> earliest recollection of my brother or of myself either for that matteris that
                    of two little fellows chasing fireflies on a lawn on the bank of the Ohio river, five or six miles
                    below Vevay, Indiana. It was a sultry evening, and the entire family sat out of doors. Our father
                    had stretched a thin silk handkerchief over his tall hat so that we might put our fireflies into the
                    hat and see them &quot;lighten&quot; under the thin silk.</p>
                <p>That father was a man of far more than ordinary gifts, both of intellect and of acquirement. The son
                    of an old Virginia planter family, and of a father who had been a captain in Washington&apos;s
                    army at Yorktown, our father had taken his degree in arts at William and Mary Collegeat that <pb
                        id="VAA2342-016" n="18"/> time a famous seat of learning. After that he had studied law in the
                    law school of Judge Tucker, at Winchester. Upon his graduation in law he had gone to the West to see
                    what use he might make of his natural and acquired gifts in a region which was then the promised
                    land to young men of character and ability.</p>
                <p>Settling himself at Vevay he soon achieved a foremost place for himself at the bar and in public
                    life, serving with marked distinction in the Indiana State Senate.</p>
                <p>But he did not permit his devotion to the law or his public activities to divert him from
                    intellectual occupations of a finer kind. He surrounded himself with books in English and French,
                    giving his leisure to the reading of philosophy, history and <hi rend="i">belleslettres</hi>.</p>
                <p>The educated people of that region held him in high esteem, while the uneducated cherished the fixed
                    conviction that he &quot;knew everything.&quot; That, of course, was <pb id="VAA2342-017"
                        n="19"/> not true, but he knew much of science, as well as of law, letters and history; and it
                    was his habit to explain things most fascinatingly to his children whenever occasion arose. I
                    suppose he told us something about insect life on that sultry August evening when he let us imprison
                    the fireflies in his hat. If he did, I was too young to remember the instruction. I recall only the
                    fun of it all.</p>
                <p>The story of our father&apos;s marriage with our mother is interesting enough to be told here,
                    particularly as it gives opportunity to explain what manner of men and women Edward
                    Eggleston&apos;s forebears were on the mother&apos;s side. Our maternal grandfather, George
                    Craig, was a Kentuckian, of early pioneer stockdescended from men who sturdily bore their part in
                    &quot;the winning of the West.&quot; His wife, Jane Lowry, was also Kentuckian, of that
                    Scotch-Irish blood which played so large a part in the Revolution and the Indian wars.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-018" n="20"/>
                <p>Together these two crossed the river, setting their negroes free, and buying great areas of fertile
                    land in Indiana. George Craig was a man of unusual intelligence and indomitable energy. He had all
                    of education that could be secured in the Kentucky of his boyhood, and he soon came to be the
                    foremost man in all southeastern Indiana.</p>
                <p>He built stoutly of stone, while those about him were content with log cabins to live in. He planted
                    large orchards even after he had reached the age of seventy years. He maintained a nursery of young
                    trees, and was the first man in all that coun try to produce improved varieties of apples and other
                    fruits by selection and careful cultivation. To this day there are grown in that region apples that
                    bear his name, because it was he who originated the varieties. The bar in the river is still
                    Craig&apos;s bar; the township in which he lived is Craig township, and the country all about
                    still bears witness to an energy and intelligence that <pb id="VAA2342-019" n="21"/> enabled that
                    one man to scrawl &quot;George Craig, his mark,&quot; all over the land.</p>
                <p>His influence was in every way good and for good. He had no patience with clumsy, shiftless methods
                    where better could be devised. He built a great stone &quot;dry house,&quot; which I
                    remember very well, though it was burned while I was yet a boy. Its upper story was for the storage
                    of all farm produce that frost might injure, and the entrance to that story was reached, not by a
                    stairway, but by a gently inclined plane of hewn beams, up which barrels might be easily rolled.
                    Below were other storage rooms for farm implementsfor he would never tolerate the practice, common
                    among farmers even yet, of leaving farm implements wherever they were last used. He insisted that
                    everything, from a rake or a plow to a hoe, should be housed when not in use.</p>
                <p>But the most interesting part of the dry house was its basement. It was the practice of the people of
                    that region, when <pb id="VAA2342-020" n="22"/> they wished to make soap, or render out lard, or
                    preserve fruits, to hang a kettle out of doors and build a fire under it. Our grandfather regarded
                    this as a shiftless proceeding, and so, in the basement of his dry house he built long stone
                    furnaces, with big and little kettles set into them, and, with broad areas left bare for the purpose
                    of drying fruits upon them. Here every year, at a minimum cost of labor, the lard from some hundreds
                    of hogs was rendered, the soap for family use was made, the preserves were put up, the apples and
                    peaches dried, and everything else done that required the use of a kettle or a flat stone with fire
                    under it.</p>
                <p>Not content with this, George Craig sought convenience in handling the great quantities of apples
                    which he grew for shipment by flatboat to New Orleans. To that end he built a very long structure,
                    called the apple house. It could be opened at both ends, and a wagon road ran through it, on <pb
                        id="VAA2342-021" n="23"/> either side of which were great bins, into which the apples were
                    unloaded from the wagons until the time should corne for barreling and shipping them.</p>
                <p>Such a man was an influence for good in the community, and both by precept and by example he taught
                    his neighbors much of thrift and energy that it was good for them to learn. He had a family of boys
                    and girls of his own, numerous enough to satisfy even President Roosevelt&apos;s idea of good
                    citizenship; but he added several adopted ones to the number. These were the children of the poorest
                    of his neighbors, who could scarcely put bread into the mouths of their numerous broods. When George
                    Craig found one of these poverty-hampered children, who gave promise of ability, he adopted the
                    child and gave him the best education that the schools of that time and country afforded. In every
                    case, I believe, these adopted ones justified his judgment and his generosity by becoming <pb
                        id="VAA2342-022" n="24"/> successful men or women, and one of them at leastSam Parkerbecame the
                    most distinguished lawyer of his time in Indiana and a State Senator of more than ordinary
                    influence. But for his adoption by George Craig he would probably never have learned even to read.</p>
                <p>Edward&apos;s mother and mine was one of George Craig&apos;s many daughters, and our father
                    met her in her father&apos;s house on the bank of the Ohio five or six miles below Vevay. He had
                    gone thither to draw up some deeds or upon some other such law business, as he had frequently done
                    before. He was to stay over night, and during the evening the shrewdly intelligent old pioneer I
                    drew the highly educated and intellectual young lawyer into a conversation of more than ordinary
                    interest.</p>
                <p>In those days tallow candles were the only artificial lights in use, and each family manufactured
                    them in tin moulds. These moulds consisted of a group of candleshaped <pb id="VAA2342-023" n="25"/>
                    tubes fastened together into a tin plate at top. In our grandfather&apos;s house one of these
                    tubes had become detached from the frame.</p>
                <p>Our mother, then a girl of eighteen or nineteen, wished to light a candle for some purpose, but, by
                    mistake, got the loose candle-mould instead. She was a girl of eager mind, and when she went to
                    light her candle, she became deeply interested in something that the young lawyer was saying and for
                    a time she stood holding the point of the tin tube in the flame of a candle on the table at her
                    father&apos;s elbow. Presently the young lawyer observed her and told heri of her mistake, to
                    her great confusion. But he observed also how deeply interested the girl had become in what he was
                    saying, and was surprised that she should know or care anything about the subject of his talk. So
                    for the first time he entered into conversation with her, and found to his astonishment that this
                    western country girl was a young <pb id="VAA2342-024" n="26"/> woman of intellect, who had read a
                    good deal with rare discretion, and who was capable of thinking soundly for herself. From that time
                    forward he sought to draw her into conversation at every opportunity. His admiration grew into a
                    warmer sentiment, and after a time she became his wife and a sharer in all his intellectual
                    pursuits. She read his law books with the rest, and he used to declare that he depended more upon
                    her counsel in dealing with perplexing law points than upon that of any lawyer at the bar.</p>
                <p>My own reverent recollection of her presents her to my mind as one of the wisest as well as one of
                    the gentlest of women.</p>
                <p>The young couple took up their residence in Vevay, in a brick house which our father bought while it
                    was in course of construction and himself finished. He built a brick office for himself in the
                    grounds, a little way from the house. Years after his death that office served Edward and me for <pb

                    which Edward organized. There we had our books, including a valuable collection of standard works
                    purchased by our widowed mother with the proceeds of the sale of our father&apos;s law library,
                    in accordance with his dying instructions.</p>
                <p>The Vevay house, in which Edward was born on the 10th of December, 1837, stood in a square of ground
                    about an acre in extentor perhaps a little more. This our father had planted in fruit trees, grape
                    vines and the like, making of it an ideal home in which to bring up boys. It has since been divided,
                    and built over with other houses.</p>
                <p>But at the time of the firefly frolic we were living on the farm which our mother had inherited from
                    her father. This change had been made for the sake of our father&apos;s health, which had never
                    been strong, and was now growing feeble.</p>

                <p>F<hi rend="sc">ROM</hi> the earliest days of its settlement until now, Indiana has taken the lead
                    among Western States in all matters that concern education. But the beginnings of education there,
                    as in all newly peopled regions, were crude in method and meagre in scope. There were some fairly
                    good schools in the little towns, presided over by the &quot;Yankee school marms,&quot;
                    whose missionary spirit early carried them across the mountains by toilsome methods of travel, and
                    brought into the early West a culture that might otherwise have been much longer delayed in its
                    coming. But in the country districts the schools were exceedingly rudimentary in character. Their
                    teachers were for the most part scantily furnished with learning on their own <pb id="VAA2342-028"
                        n="29"/> account, and they knew nothing whatever of the art or the science of teaching.
                    Pedagogyif the word had been brought to their attentionwould have meant to them nothing more than a
                    new word to be &quot;given out&quot; at spelling matches for the confusion of the champion
                    spellers of the neighborhood.</p>
                <p>Any man who could &quot;read, write, and cipher to the rule of three&quot; was thought to be
                    equipped for the mastery of a school, if he had also a strong arm and a determined will with which
                    to maintain his mastery and keep his pupils in subjection.</p>
                <p>But one fact was significant, and it was prophetic of that advancement in culture which Indiana has
                    since achieved. Poor as the schools were, absolutely all the boys and girls in the district attended
                    them. This was true even before the schools became free, and while yet each pupil&apos;s tuition
                    must be paid for at rates varying, according to age, from fifty cents to two dollars a <pb
                        id="VAA2342-029" n="30"/> quarter. If there was not much of education to be secured in the
                    country districts in those early days, at any rate everybody there was determined to get all of it
                    that could be had.</p>
                <p>It was under these conditions that Edward Eggleston entered his first school, at the age of six
                    years. By dint of much entreaty I secured a decision, at the hands of the family conclave,
                    permitting me also to attend the school, under the protection of our mother&apos;s
                    &quot;bound girl,&quot; who was, of course, to be a pupil.</p>
                <p>In those days almost every family in tolerably comfortable circumstances had one &quot;bound
                    girl&quot; or more. These were usually orphans who had been left destitute on the death of their
                    parents. Instead of sending them to be reared in orphan asylums, of which there were none in that
                    self-reliant land of promise, or sending them to the poorhouse, which was apt to be an exceedingly
                    poor house indeed, the public authorities <pb id="VAA2342-030" n="31"/> usually indentured such
                    orphans to serve during their nonage in families able and willing to care for them. They became
                    members of the families in every such case, and were never conscious of a condition of subjection in
                    that simple, democratic state of existence where it was the custom of all to work, and where each
                    did the duty that lay next to him or her, without a thought that there could be aught of humiliation
                    in doing it, or any shame, except in neglect to do it honestly and well.</p>
                <p>The bound girl or bound boy always went to school with the other children of the family, whenever
                    &quot;school kept,&quot; as the phrase wentthat is to say, whenever there was a school open
                    in the neighborhood, which was usually during three months, or, under favorable circumstances,
                    during five or six months of each year. The indentures indeed required those to whom girls and boys
                    were bound, to give them at least three months of schooling in each year; but the <pb
                        id="VAA2342-031" n="32"/> requirement was wholly unnecessary as a legal prescription in a
                    generously-minded community, where public sentiment and a common moral sense impelled all parents,
                    guardians and masters to give to every child the most and the best of education that could be
                    secured.</p>
                <p>The school which Edward and I first attended was in some respects interesting. It was held in a log
                    cabin a mile or so from our house. The master was a very estimable man named Benefiel, who had
                    taught our mother before us. He enjoyed an enviable reputation for scholarship, which I have no
                    doubt was thoroughly well deserved. For one thing the &quot;rule of three&quot; had set no
                    bounds to his mathematical acquirements. It was wonderingly said of him that &quot;he knew the
                    whole arithmetic,&quot; and it was darkly whispered that in addition to that he possessed
                    certain occult knowledge which in our time would be described as an acquaintance with elementary
                    Algebra and the rudiments <pb id="VAA2342-032" n="33"/> of Geometry. I think I do not wrong the good
                    man&apos;s memory or betray any confidence in saying that I met him many years afterward, when
                    he was an old man and I a college student, and that he then confessed to me that even at the time of
                    my earliest school days he had been able to find out the value of x in a simple equation.</p>
                <p>But when Edward Eggleston was six years old and I four, Mr. Benefiel &quot;kept school&quot;
                    upon the primitive plan that was then everywhere accepted.</p>
                <p>There was only one point of radical difference between different schools in those days; some of them
                    were &quot;loud schools&quot; and some were &quot;still schools.&quot; Mr.
                    Benefiel&apos;s was a &quot;loud&quot; school. That is to say, he required all his
                    pupils to study their lessons &quot;out loud,&quot; in order that he might be sure they were
                    all studying.</p>
                <p>Some of the pupils, as I now realize, though I did not recognize the fact at the time, were possessed
                    of nervous systems.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-033" n="34"/>
                <p>These unfortunate ones were naturally and sorely disturbed in their minds by the babel of ceaselessly
                    wagging tongues. In order to drown the distracting sound of others&apos; voices, these nervous
                    ones were accustomed to raise their own voices higher and higher, and to shout louder and louder as
                    the period of study went on.</p>
                <p>For my own part, being a little lad of exceedingly robust physique, I mightily enjoyed this tumult.
                    But poor Edward, a nervous and sensitive child, was tortured by it into a condition of mental
                    helplessness in which he found it impossible to determine in his own mind whether the letters
                    &quot;b-a-k-e-r&quot; in his spelling book spelled &quot;lady&quot; or
                    &quot;shady.&quot; He would go over and over the words with that conscientiousness which
                    lashed and tortured him well-nigh to the end of his days, but all to no purpose. He simply could not
                    force attention upon his mind in the midst of such a din.</p>
                <p>I got off much more easily, as I remember <pb id="VAA2342-034" n="35"/> with a chuckle of delight
                    even now, by means of a device of my own. I made it a practice merely to shout the vowel in the
                    accented syllable of each word, leaving the rest of it to whatever fate chance might decree for it.</p>
                <p>Not many moons before he left us for the long journey that each of us must make alone, I talked with
                    Edward about all this. In the course of our conversation I said to him:</p>
                <p>&quot;What a troublesome conscience you had in your boyhood!&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, with a laugh. &quot;And its most troublesome peculiarity
                    was its vicariousness. I have spent many sleepless nights, Geordie, in repenting of <hi rend="i"
                        >your</hi> sins. Since I grew old enough and wise enough to leave them to your care I have slept
                    better.&quot;</p>
                <p>But in those long gone days, when he and I were little fellows, in our first school, Edward detected
                    my trick of deceiving the master, and it mightily disturbed his conscience. <pb id="VAA2342-035"
                        n="36"/> He trudged homeward that day in a solemn silence, which no word of mine could induce
                    him to break, though I tried hard to divert his mind, in the conviction that his silence was in some
                    way prompted by his knowledge of some misconduct of mine. I was conscious of many things in my
                    conduct which would not bear close scrutiny. When we reached home Edward was confronted with a new
                    conscientious scruple, worse even than the first. He knew of no way by which he could hope to save
                    me from the consequences of my sin of deception, except by reporting the facts to our mother. But
                    our father, a Virginian of sternest virtue in all that touched upon honor in conduct, had taught him
                    from infancy to regard all tale bearing as unutterably mean and unworthy of &quot;a
                    gentleman&apos;s son&quot;for that appeal to the law of <hi rend="i">noblesse oblige</hi>
                    was always our father&apos;s final resort of instruction.</p>
                <p>Thus Edward dared not relieve his conscience by making a charge of deception <pb id="VAA2342-036"
                        n="37"/> against me before the domestic tribunal presided over by our mother. I think he must
                    have passed as nearly a sleepless night over this matter of divided duty as it is possible for a six
                    year old boy to spend over any trouble.</p>
                <p>When morning came he had decided upon his course of conduct. He asked Jane, the bound girl, to walk
                    well in front of us on the way to school. Then he took my little hand lovingly into his own scarcely
                    larger one and expounded his thought to me. In his preternaturally old and wise way, he set forth
                    the fact that, in doing as I had done, I had been deceiving the teacher.</p>
                <p>I promptly admitted that. I even confessed that it had been my deliberate purpose to deceive him, and
                    that I intended to go on doing so. I do not suppose that my four-year-old intelligence formulated
                    the thought in those words, but 1 very well remember that my little baby soul was in revolt against
                    what I vaguely perceived to be the <pb id="VAA2342-037" n="38"/> injustice of requiring a poor
                    little fellow like me to stand shoulder to shoulder with older boys and girls, some of them twenty
                    years old or more, and do like tasks with them. I managed somehow to convey this thought to
                    Edward&apos;s mind, and I resolutely went on with my device for equalizing matters by cheating
                    the master out of that which I did not regard as his due.</p>
                <p>I cannot remember now how Edward settled this affair with his vicarious conscience. Neither could he
                    remember, when we laughingly talked of the incident at Lake George one day, a year or two before his
                    death.</p>
                <p>Let us return to the school. Discipline in those days always took the form of physical chastisement.
                    On his way to school every morning the master cut and trimmed eight or ten stout beechen
                    &quot;switches,&quot; as they were calledox goads would have been a fitter name. They were
                    about five feet long and of a goodly diameter. These he <pb id="VAA2342-038" n="39"/> placed on two
                    pegs in the wall just over his deskall of them but one. That one he kept always on his desk or in
                    his strong right hand for instant use when needed. Thus armed for the day&apos;s work the master
                    felt himself equipped to compel good behavior and a due advancement in learning on the part of his
                    &quot;scholars&quot;for the words &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;pupil&quot;
                    were not in school use at that time. It was always &quot;the master&quot; and &quot;the
                    scholars.&quot;</p>
                <p>The belligerent method of instruction extended to every matter that required correction or any
                    encouragement to endeavor. If a boy misspelled, a word, he instantly received a sharp cut from the
                    master&apos;s switch. If he failed to get the right answer to his &quot;sum&quot; he was
                    encouraged to try harder by two or three stinging blows. If he whispered to a neighbor without first
                    saying to the master, &quot;Please may I speak to Johnny,&quot; the fault was treated with
                    some severity as a grave moral delinquency, and <pb id="VAA2342-039" n="40"/> punished by at least
                    half a dozen lashes. If one of the little boys, who was too young to &quot;take
                    writin&apos;,&quot; crawled upon the bench which fronted the long writing desk, and thus
                    turned his back upon the master, an attack from the rear was sure to come quickly.</p>
                <p>In the case of more serious offences, involving real moral delinquency, the offender was summoned to
                    the open space in front of the master&apos;s desk, where he was required to remove his coat, if
                    he had one, and there he was severely flogged. Not in Mr. Benefiel&apos;s school, but in another
                    which Edward and I attended some years later in the little city of Madison, I several times saw
                    shirts deeply stained with blood when these castigations were over.</p>
                <p>There were here and there schoolmasters disposed to experiment in what I may properly call pedagogic
                    penology. These sought to give the element of variety to school discipline, and to reduce the use of
                        <pb id="VAA2342-040" n="41"/> the rod somewhat, by the substitution of such devices as
                    fools&apos; caps, dunces&apos; stools and the like. One of them sometimes punished a boy by
                    making him stand on one leg till he could stand no more, and then flogging him for putting the other
                    foot down. But such experiments were usually unsuccessful, at least in the country districts. The
                    boys, accustomed as they were to a severer method, were apt to conclude that a master thus gently
                    minded was &quot;afeard&quot; to whip them, and in most such cases they went into insolent
                    revolt in an endeavor to see how far they might defy an authority which they deemed weakly
                    irresolute. The struggle between the master and the scholars was continuous, and it was accounted by
                    the boys rather as an enjoyable than a regretable part of their school-boy life.</p>
                <p>If the master assumed to &quot;keep school&quot; on a holiday, the scholars all attended. But
                    they went to school earlier than usual, took possession there, and &quot;locked the master <pb
                        id="VAA2342-041" n="42"/> out,&quot; barricading doors and windows and standing upon their
                    defence. Then ensued a struggle, the master trying to force his way into the school-house and the
                    scholars trying to keep him out. If he got in, he flogged everybody concerned. If the scholars were
                    successful in their defence the master secured peace upon terms that were quite well understood in
                    advance. He agreed to &quot;treat&quot; the school to a bushel of apples and to punish
                    nobody for having participated in the rebellion. Just why a bushel of apples should have been so
                    placative in a country in which everybody had unlimited apples at home, it is difficult to
                    conjecture. Perhaps it was because apples were about the only thing available for the purpose, and
                    because their enforced contribution marked and signalized victory on the part of the scholars. It
                    was an unequal contest in every way. The scholars had the advantages of possession, fortification
                    and superior numbers. But these odds were in a measure offset by <pb id="VAA2342-042" n="43"/> the
                    inequality of the stakes, as it were. The scholars risked a very painful punishment upon the chance
                    of getting only some apples.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the master succeeded in carrying the fort. Readers of &quot;The Hoosier
                    Schoolmaster&quot; will remember that Ralph Hartsook did so. But usually the master was forced
                    to yield the victory to the insurgent scholars.</p>
                <p>The master&apos;s authority was by tradition held to extend for half a mile from the school-house
                    in every direction. Any offence committed within that distance, on the way to or from school, was
                    within the jurisdiction. When two boys had arranged to fight, or when one boy had made up his mind
                    to thrash another, the two would walk by the same roadthough their homes might lie in opposite
                    directionsuntil the half mile line was passed. Then the set-to would occur, without the fear of the
                    schoolmaster before the eyes of the combatants.</p>
                <p>Both Edward and I could read before <pb id="VAA2342-043" n="44"/> we entered our first school.
                    Neither of us, indeed, could ever remember a time when we could not read or ride a horse, and
                    neither ever knew when or how he learned either art. In our father&apos;s house the children
                    &quot;staggered against books&quot; in their infancy, as Dr. Holmes puts the matter. But at
                    school no account whatever was taken of our ability to read, nor were we permitted to practice that
                    art. It was the fixed rule of the master that each scholar should&quot; go through the
                    spelling-book three times, twice on the book and once off the book,&quot; before beginning to
                    read. &quot;On the book&quot; meant spelling and pronouncing the words, with the book before
                    the eyes. &quot;Off the book&quot; meant spelling from memory as the words were given out.</p>
                <p>In addition to the regular spelling lessons of the day, the whole school was required, as a final
                    exercise each afternoon, to stand in one long row, called &quot;the big spelling
                    class,&quot; for competitive examination <pb id="VAA2342-044" n="45"/> in the art. If a word was
                    misspelled by one, it was passed to the next below, and so on till some one succeeded in spelling it
                    correctly. The successful speller was said to have &quot;turned down&quot; all who had
                    failed, and was entitled to take his place above them in the line. At the close of the exercise the
                    scholar who stood at the head of the class was assigned to the foot of it for the next day, and a
                    record was kept of the number of times that each had &quot;gone foot.&quot; Some small
                    distinction was supposed to have been achieved by the scholar whose record at the end of the term
                    showed the greatest number of goings to the foot. This was about the only use made of the principle
                    of rewards in the country schools of that time. No other word of praise was ever spoken by the
                    teacher. Indeed, he would have put himself in serious danger of losing his place had he indulged any
                    impulse he might have had to commend a pupil. It was at that time held that commendation was sure to
                        <pb id="VAA2342-045" n="46"/> spoil a child and breed vanity and conceit in his mind.</p>
                <p>The prominence given to spelling over all other educational agencies at that time was still further
                    emphasized by frequent &quot;spelling matches.&quot; My brother has so fully described these
                    that I shall not here attempt to add anything to what he wrote concerning them. His account of these
                    contests led to their revival all over the country as a novel and amusing form of social
                    entertainment.</p>
                <p>One incident, however, I must relate. In &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; one Jeems or
                    Jim Phillips is mentioned as the champion speller. The text says of him:</p>
                <p>&quot;Jim Phillips was a tall, lank, stoopshouldered fellow, who had never distinguished himself
                    in any other pursuit than spelling. Except in this one art of spelling he was of no account. He
                    could not catch well or bat well in ball. He could not throw well enough to make his mark in that
                    famous <pb id="VAA2342-046" n="47"/> western game of Bull-Pen. He did not succeed well in any study
                    but that of Webster&apos;s Elementary. But in that he wasto use the usual Flat Creek locutionin
                    that he was &apos; a boss.&apos; This genius for spelling is in some people a sixth sense, a
                    matter of intuition. Some spellers are born and not made, and their facility reminds one of the
                    mathematical prodigies that crop out every now and then to bewilder the world. Bud Means, foreseeing
                    that Ralph would be pitted against Jim Phillips, had warned his friend that Jim could &apos;
                    spell like thunder and lightning,&apos; and that it &apos; took a powerful smart
                    speller&apos; to beat him, for he knew &apos; a heap of spelling book.&apos; To have
                    &apos; spelled down the master&apos; is next thing to having whipped the biggest bully in
                    Hoopole county, and Jim had &apos; spelled down&apos; the last three masters. He divided the
                    hero-worship of the district with Bud Means.&quot;</p>
                <p>While &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; was running as a serial story in <hi rend="i"
                        >Hearth and Home,</hi>
                    <pb id="VAA2342-047" n="48"/> the local newspaper in Edward&apos;s native town of Vevay, secured
                    permission to publish it in instalments. It so happened that in naming his champion speller Jeems
                    Phillips, Edward had drawn upon unconscious memory. For the actual champion speller of our
                    boyhood&apos;s days bore precisely that name and in other ways answered closely to the
                    description given of him in the book. When the chapters concerning him appeared in the Vevay <hi
                        rend="i">Reveille,</hi> Jeems Phillips&apos;s friends began teasing him on the subject. He
                    soon worked himself into a rage, and mounting his horse, rode into Vevay, with the avowed purpose of
                    &quot;lickin&apos; that thar&apos; editor feller,&quot; for he fully believed that
                    the author of &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; was engaged in editing the local
                    newspaper. The actual editor succeeded at last in convincing him that the author of the story lived
                    in far-off New York. Going further, he explained to Jeems that so far from having put an affront
                    upon him, Edward had been greatly celebrating <pb id="VAA2342-048" n="49"/> his attainments as a
                    speller, and that he ought to feel pride rather than anger on such an occasion. This view of the
                    matter commended itself to the vanity of Jeems Phillips. From that day forth he gloried in the new
                    celebrity conferred upon him. He was the only man in that region who had been &quot;put into a
                    book,&quot; the only one who had sufficiently distinguished himself to deserve literary
                    celebration. Thenceforth no gibe on that subject could ruffle him. Every mention of it ministered to
                    his self-satisfaction.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1900, Edward and I revisited our native town together, and while there we heard the
                    sequel to the story. When well advanced in years Jeems Phillips had married, and at the wedding he
                    wore a gorgeous red and yellow flowered waistcoat. He gave it out that this highly impressive
                    garment had been sent to him as a wedding present by the author of &quot;The Hoosier
                    Schoolmaster.&quot; When he had pretty well <pb id="VAA2342-049" n="50"/> worn it out, he cut
                    the cloth into bits and sold them as souvenirs to his admiring friends, who firmly believed the
                    story of that waistcoat&apos;s origin.</p>
                <p>During his later life, after his twentyyears of minute investigation and scholarly study of the
                    forces that had moulded life conditions in America, Edward thought he saw the reason for the
                    excessive attention given to spelling in the early forties. It was, he thought, an instinctive
                    effort to repair a previous neglect. He pointed out the fact, made obvious by the old writings he
                    had studied so closely, that the original settlers in America and their immediate children spelled
                    much better than did the men and women of the second generation. This fact he attributed to the
                    compulsory neglect of education by a generation engaged in subduing the wilderness. In the same way,
                    during the strenuous time of the &quot;winning of the West,&quot; there had been little
                    opportunity for education, and, when a little later <pb id="VAA2342-050" n="51"/> the people of the
                    West began to realize their deficiency, they set to work to repair it in the persons of their
                    children. As that deficiency showed itself more glaringly in the matter of spelling than in any
                    other, it was altogether natural that the new generation should give great and even excessive
                    attention to the acquirement of that one art.</p>
                <p>If the reader is curious to know how excessively bad the spelling of an otherwise well educated and
                    accomplished person can be, he is advised to read Mrs. Ravenel&apos;s very charming and
                    interesting collection of the letters of Eliza Pinckneyborn Eliza Lucas. No better educated or more
                    variedly accomplished gentlewoman than Mrs. Pinckney lived in all the land in the Colonial times.
                    Yet she spelled &quot;hot&quot; with two &quot;t&quot;s, always wrote
                    &quot;sopose&quot; for suppose, and spelled generally in the erratic fashion that these two
                    examples would suggest.</p>

                    to say with certainty, but I think it lasted throughout the winter and spring months. During the
                    next three years we were only twice placed in school, and then only for brief periods. The schools
                    we then attended were what the English call &quot;Dames&apos; schools.&quot; Each of
                    them was taught by a lady, and the pupils were all little children. I remember that one of these
                    ladies was a worthy German woman who could speak but little English, and that so brokenly that we
                    found it difficult to understand her. Whether or not Edward learned anything in those two schools I
                    do not know. I am very sure I did not. But the companionship of children of our own age, <pb

                    for both of us.</p>
                <p>For the rest, our mother taught us lovingly and well at home, though she had two younger children and
                    our father, whose health was rapidly declining, to care for. She was always a duty loving woman, and
                    a brave one, who faced adverse conditions with courage and cheerfulness.</p>
                <p>We two boys lived much out of doora during that period of three years, and we were very happy.
                    Indoors we helped when any entertainment was in preparation, by attending to pigs or fowls that were
                    roasting in front of the great cavernous kitchen fireplacefor at that time no such thing as a
                    cooking stove was known. The fowls and pigs to be roasted were hung by strings from the ceiling, and
                    it was our duty to keep the strings twisted so that the roasts should continually revolve. We were
                    expected also to baste the meats with their own juices, from the dripping pans below.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-054" n="54"/>
                <p>For outdoor employments we had only to convoy the cows to and from the pasture twice a day, and in
                    the autumn to throw corn to the hogs in the pen. Of these animals there were a hundred or so on the
                    farm. During the summer they ran wild in the woods on a high hill, growing lean and healthy under
                    conditions that were natural to them. In the autumn they were driven in and confined in a great pen,
                    enclosed by a rail fence. Here they were fed upon unlimited corn, in order to fatten them quickly.
                    Edward and I mightily rejoiced in throwing corn to them and listening to their crunching of the
                    grains as they ate. So great was our enjoyment of this sport that we often sacrificed our own
                    breakfasts rather than leave the neighborhood of the pig-pen.</p>
                <p>&quot;Hog killing time &quot;meant even more than Christmas did to us. It came in December,
                    when the weather was sharply cold. The slaughtering was usually done on the river beach, where a
                    great bonfire was made <pb id="VAA2342-055" n="55"/> and filled with stones, while casks were sunk
                    into the sand and filled with water. When the stones were at white heat they were cast into the
                    water-casks until the water boiled Then the hogs, as soon as they had been thoroughly bled, were
                    thrust into the boiling water and, upon being withdrawn, were scraped clean of hair, and afterwards
                    dressed for curing.</p>
                <p>As the bonfire was lighted about four o&apos;clock in the morning, while it was still dark, and
                    as we boys were always permitted to get up in time to see it lighted, the occasion took upon itself
                    in our eyes the character of a mad revel. Then, too, the farm hands who did the killing and dressing
                    always gave us the tails of the hogs, and we roasted them in the coals of the bonfire. We devoured
                    them without bread, and generally our impatience was such that we ate them half raw. But the <hi
                        rend="i">trichina spiralis</hi> had never been heard of in that early time, and our half savage
                    outdoor life had given us <pb id="VAA2342-056" n="56"/> digestions fit to wrestle with worse enemies
                    to health than underdone pig tails.</p>
                <p>When Edward was nine years of age our father died. He approached the end slowly, knowing how
                    inevitable it was. But with the calm mind of a brave man, he recognized the truth and set his house
                    in order for the coming event. He was especially concerned for the health of his children. He had
                    himself been frail from boyhood, and he was now about to die, while yet a young man in his thirties.
                    He firmly believed that his impaired constitution and his early, death were the consequences of
                    excessive study and neglect of the outdoor life. To guard his children against a fate like his own,
                    he carefully instructed our mother with reference to our bringing up. He enjoined her to guard us
                    against overstudy and sedentary habits, and asked her particularly to see to it that, during
                    boyhood&apos;s years, we should be sent to the country every summer to work on a farm for our
                    board. So much of <pb id="VAA2342-057" n="57"/> compensation he desired us to receive in order that
                    our sense of justice might not be offended. But he desired that we should at no time be permitted to
                    receive money wages, lest we acquire in youth that money loving spirit which he feared was to become
                    the bane of our country.</p>
                <p>These injunctions were carried out with the good-health results he had expected from them, so far as
                    I was concerned. But Edward&apos;s health was weak from the first, and even the annual summer on
                    a farm did not serve to repair the frailty of his constitution. Perhaps it saved him from an early
                    decline, however, and certainly he enjoyed farm life and the light tasks exacted of us with quite
                    all the zest that boys of this later time feel in their summer sports of a less useful kind.</p>
                <p>The great dread in Edward&apos;s case was of pulmonary consumption, the malady of which our
                    father had died. Throughout his boyhood Edward suffered with what I suppose <pb id="VAA2342-058"
                        n="58"/> to have been chronic bronchitis, though the doctors called it phthisic, which I take to
                    be only another spelling of phthisis, or consumption. It was not, indeed, until after he had passed
                    middle life that he completely threw off this trouble and ceased to feel apprehension for his lungs.</p>
                <p>During the year after our father&apos;s death our mother let the farm, now greatly reduced in
                    size, to a tenant, and removed with her four children to the house in Vevay in which Edward and I
                    had been born. The schools there were much better than any that existed in the country. One of them,
                    which Edward attended for a time, when his health permittedand that was never for long at a timewas
                    held in a long, one-storied, red brick school-house, that is still standing, though used now as a
                    dwelling. The school was taught successively by several men, some of them students &quot;working
                    their way&quot; through college. Another school, and a good one in its way, was kept <pb
                        id="VAA2342-059" n="59"/> by the Presbyterian minister and his wife, who in that way eked out
                    the slender salary allowed them by the Home Missionary Society.</p>
                <p>This gentleman, Mr. Hiram Wasson, was a New Englander, college bred, with some general culture, and
                    possessed of the gift of making his pupils like him as well as respect him. He had a gentle, sunny
                    nature, with a spice of pleasant humor in it, which he was not too dignified to employ in the
                    school. His wife was a typical New England school teachera profession for which she had been
                    trainedand she, too, had qualities that won the pupils.</p>
                <p>The school was held in the Presbyterian church, of which Mr. Wasson was pastor. With the cleverness
                    which all New England men are supposed to possess, Mr. Wasson fitted up the church for its double
                    use, by hinging a narrow board to the back of each pew. These boards were provided with supports
                    below, and when raised they served <pb id="VAA2342-060" n="60"/> the purposes of desks. On Friday
                    evening the supports were removed, the boards hung down the back of the pews, and the place was
                    ready for use as a church.</p>
                <p>Mr. Wasson never flogged. His nature was far too gentle for that brutality, and his ingenuity was
                    quite equal to the task of maintaining discipline without resort to it. He invented a number of
                    devices by which to punish when punishment was necessary. These devices were always good-natured,
                    and usually there was a touch of humor in them, so that they amused and interested the school
                    instead of offending its sentiment of justice.</p>
                <p>It was in this school chiefly that Edward and I were taught during the two or three years of our stay
                    in Vevay at that time. Something educationally much better was to come some years later, when, after
                    an absence of considerable duration we returned to our native town, and fell under the wise
                    government and instruction of a gifted <pb id="VAA2342-061" n="61"/> woman, Mrs. Julia L. Dumont, a
                    born educator, and the wisest one, man or woman, that I have ever known. She was, indeed, a Dr.
                    Arnold in petticoats. Of her and her influence upon Edward&apos;s character and mind I shall
                    write more fully in a later chapter. At the time with which this present chapter concerns itself,
                    Edward Eggleston was still a little boy, acquiring only the rudiments of education. His health was
                    so uncertain that his school attendance rarely, at any period of his boyhood, continued for more
                    than a few weeks without interruption. But when too ill to go to school, he worked diligently at
                    home, and a good deal more than kept up with his classes.</p>
                <p>Vevay was in some respects a peculiar town, and life there was quite different in many ways, from
                    life in Southern Indiana generally. The town lies on the bank of the Ohio river, about sixty or
                    seventy miles below Cincinnati. It is built on a plain, or two plains rather, having different
                    levels.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-062" n="62"/>
                <p>The part nearest the river is subject to overflow at times of very high water, while the main part of
                    the town, lying upon the higher plain near the hills, is not troubled in that way even at the times
                    of the greatest freshets.</p>
                <p>Vevay is framed in hills of considerable height and great beauty. In our boyhood these hills were
                    clad from foot to crest in a dense growth of original beech forest. The trees have since been cut
                    away in great part, unfortunately, but the town, which was attractive half a century ago, is now the
                    most beautiful one I have anywhere seen in America.</p>
                <p>Vevay was originally settled by a company of thrifty Swiss immigrants, near the beginning of the
                    nineteenth century. These and their descendants gave to the place and the country immediately
                    surrounding it, a character quite different from that of other small Ohio river villages. They were
                    an energetic people for one thing, and for another they had brought with them from <pb
                        id="VAA2342-063" n="63"/> Switzerland a healthy disposition to enjoy life. They built stoutly
                    and with a good deal of attention to the beauty of their homes and their surroundings, as well as to
                    their convenience and comfort.</p>
                <p>Whether in town or in the country their houses were as spacious as their means would permit them to
                    build, and they were always made either of brick or of wood, stoutly framed. So far as I can learn
                    not one of those people ever contented himself either with a log cabin or with a slightly built
                    wooden house. Not one of them neglected to give what he could of tasteful ornamentation to his
                    dwelling.</p>
                <p>In the country these people always reserved a considerable space from agriculture for house grounds.
                    In the town they sought spacious &quot;lots,&quot; sometimes of half an acre or more, in
                    which to build. These grounds they planted with fruit trees, grape vines, on ornamental arbors,
                    flowering shrubs and beds of dainty flowers. These things <pb id="VAA2342-064" n="64"/> and the
                    climbing rose bushes and honeysuckles that were trained up the walls, quickly robbed a home place of
                    its raw newness, while in the case of homes that had been established in the earlier days of the
                    town, the aspect was as calmly reposeful as that of any old English manse. There was everywhere
                    scrupulous cleanliness and exquisite neatness which extended to every detail of gardening, pruning
                    and the like. The region had been an untouched wilderness when the Swiss settlers first went
                    thither, about 1802. They made it literally &quot;blossom like a rose.&quot;</p>
                <p>They were a hardy race, toolong lived and life-enjoying in their comfortable, unpretentious ways. The
                    fifth child born in that region after the Swiss settlement was made still survives at the age of
                    ninety odd years. When Edward and I revisited the town, in the spring of 1900, we found her enjoying
                    life like any youngster. She was known to everybody as &quot;Aunt Lucy Detraz,&quot; and was
                        <pb id="VAA2342-065" n="65"/> always one of the most esteemed and best beloved women in the
                    community. When Edward and I visited her for the last time we found her sitting bolt upright doing
                    some exquisite needlework, without glasses to aid a vision which good health had preserved
                    unimpaired. She greeted us cheerily, saying to us gray-haired veterans, in response to
                    Edward&apos;s question whether she remembered us or not:</p>
                <p>&quot;Of course I remember you boys. I ought to, for I gave each of you the first bath you ever
                    had after coming into this world, and dressed you in the first clothes you ever wore.&quot;</p>
                <p>The Swiss settlers chose the site of Vevay for their abiding place because of its real or fancied
                    resemblance to their native region in Switzerland. They gave the town its Swiss name and, when
                    Indiana became a State, they called their county Switzerland. Both names have survived.</p>
                <p>But further than that, they sought to <pb id="VAA2342-066" n="66"/> transplant to their home in the
                    new world the industry they had pursued in the old. They cleared the rich plains, or
                    &quot;bottoms,&quot; as Western nomenclature has it, and planted them with vineyards. Thus,
                    nearly half a century before Nicholas Longworth established the wine growing industry near
                    Cincinnati, it was nourishing around Vevay, under the skilled hands of a people who had been born
                    among the vines.</p>
                <p>When Edward and I were boys the vine still constituted the principal crop of the Swiss and their
                    descendants. Later came the great &quot;temperance&quot; wave, which not only discouraged
                    the making, selling or drinking of any liquid that had alcohol in it, but presently brought the
                    making of wine into something like actual disrepute. As this sentiment grew in intensity, one after
                    another of the repute-loving Switzers yielded to it, destroying his vines and turning his attention
                    to crops of other kinds.</p>
                <p>As an illustration of the character of <pb id="VAA2342-067" n="67"/> the people who constituted a
                    considerable part of Vevay&apos;s population during Edward&apos;s boyhood, I may be
                    permitted to relate here one incident of this transformation. Just below the town lived one of the
                    most thrifty of the Swiss. His vineyards and orchards were extensive, and his housea large brick
                    structure, having one wing built expressly for use as a ball-room, stood in ample ornamental
                    grounds. With him lived his old mother, one of the original Swiss born and Swiss bred settlers. The
                    old lady protested stoutly against the destruction of the vineyards, saying that she had been born
                    and reared among vineyards, as all her ancestors had been, and that she intended to die with the
                    vines within sight. But the popular sentiment in condemnation of wine growing was becoming daily
                    more intense. It was beginning to be the current opinion that wine growing was not a respectable
                    pursuit, and that the wine grower belonged in one class with the keeper of a liquor shop. The <pb
                        id="VAA2342-068" n="68"/> son and master of the house smarted under such condemnation and was
                    determined not to endure it longer. His old mother was much too feeble ever to leave the house, even
                    for the purpose of taking a few steps on the ground. But she liked to sit at a window and look out
                    upon the vineyards. The son, therefore, made a careful survey from every window of the house in
                    order to learn precisely how much of the vine lands could be seen from each. That done, he destroyed
                    all of the vineyards that lay beyond the range of the old lady&apos;s vision, preserving every
                    vine that could in any way be seen from the house. Thenceforth he marketed as fruit the grapes borne
                    by such vines as had been spared. He thus saved his reputation from the aspersions even of the most
                    intemperate &quot;temperance&quot; propagandists, while tenderly sparing his old
                    mother&apos;s feelings. She died in the belief that her whole life to its end had been passed in
                    the midst of vineyards.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-069" n="69"/>
                <p>By the time that Edward and I were old enough to know our surroundings, the Swiss people had ceased
                    to be in a majority even in the town, while very few of them or their descendants lived more than a
                    few miles away. Among our school fellows in Vevay the Swiss names Detraz, Grisard, Dufour, Dumont,
                    Tardy, Courvoisseur, Danglade, Thiebaud (which was corrupted in its pronunciation into Kay-bo),
                    Moreraud, Le Clerc, Malin, Golay, Bettens, Minnit, Violet, Duprez, Medary, Schenck, Girard and
                    others of Swiss origin, abounded. But even in the town a large part of the small population of 1500
                    or 1800 was by that time of other than Swiss origin, while in the country generally, outside of
                    Vevay, there were almost no people of Swiss extraction.</p>
                <p>Southern Indiana, with its rich lands, and its easy access to markets by means of the river, in days
                    when railroads had not begun to be, had been peculiarly attractive to settlers from every quarter.
                    There were <pb id="VAA2342-070" n="70"/> a number of Virginians there who, disliking slavery, had
                    set their negroes free and were seeking to rebuild their fortunes in a new country which promised to
                    grow rapidly. There were, in greater numbers, Kentuckians who, like our maternal grandfather, had
                    crossed the river to aid in the winning of a new West, and had mightily thriven there. There were a
                    good many Scotchmen, too, who, by their sturdy morality, speedily made themselves influential for
                    good in the community. There were Pennsylvanians and a small sprinkling of New Englanders. Finally,
                    there was a considerable number of people from North Carolina and elsewhere in the South, who had
                    belonged to the &quot;poor white&quot; class.</p>
                <p>These latter were always unthrifty, though they had virtues of their own. They drank too much whiskey
                    when they could get it. They neglected their crops in order to go fishing and hunting, or frolicking
                    at each other&apos;s houses. Very few of them <pb id="VAA2342-071" n="71"/> manifested either
                    disposition or capacity to improve their condition, even in a country which afforded abundant
                    opportunity to every man. They were renters, nearly always, very few of them ever managing to become
                    the owners of land, though fertile fields were to be had at small cost and on long credits. In
                    hunting and fishing they were tirelessly energetic, but in work of a more profitable kind they were
                    indolent and careless. They tilled their corn enough to make it yield half a crop perhapsof which
                    onethird went to pay the rentbut with that they were content. Any sort of shelter was good enough to
                    satisfy their ideas of a home, and as for comforts in the house, they were too well used to the
                    absence of such things to miss them or care for them.</p>
                <p>But these people were perfectly honest, and except when in their cups, they were law-abiding. In
                    anger and under stimulus of whiskey they sometimes, but rarely, committed crimes of violence, but
                    meaner <pb id="VAA2342-072" n="72"/> offences against the law were almost unknown among them. They
                    were brave, and intensely pugnacious under provocation, but otherwise they were a kindly,
                    good-natured folk, and generous to a fault when they had anything with which to be generous.</p>
                <p>It was among a population thus diverse in origin that the Hoosier dialect had its origin. Its
                    variations from correct speech were the conglomerate product of many varieties of ignorance. In a
                    large degree they were the result of misdirected efforts to speak with more than ordinary accuracy.
                    Uneducated persons who observed that their educated neighbors always said &quot;get&quot;
                    and &quot;yet&quot; and &quot;kettle&quot; and the like instead of
                    &quot;git&quot; and &quot;yit&quot; and &quot;kittle,&quot; accepted the
                    principle of pronunciation thus suggested, and misapplied it. In their anxiety to pronounce
                    correctly, they said &quot;led&quot; for &quot;lid,&quot; &quot;set&quot;
                    for &quot;sit,&quot; and so on through an entire class of words. In the same way, finding
                    that the educated people around them never <pb id="VAA2342-073" n="73"/> spoke of a
                    &quot;nuss,&quot; but said &quot;nurse&quot; instead, the illiterate adopted the
                    practice of saying &quot;furse&quot; when they meant &quot;fuss.&quot;</p>
                <p>When &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; was in press for publication in book form, its
                    author had it in mind to print with it as a preface, a somewhat extensive study of this dialect. He
                    wrote for that purpose an essay of rare scholarship and abundant interest, and after it was in type,
                    he abandoned his purpose and suppressed what he had written on the subject. His reason for doing so
                    did not seem to me at the time to be adequate, nor does it seem so now. It is set forth as follows
                    in the brief preface which was actually printed:</p>
                <p>&quot;It has been in my mind to append some remarks, philological and otherwise, upon the
                    dialect, but Professor Lowell&apos;s admirable and erudite preface to the Biglow Papers must be
                    the despair of every one who aspires to write on Americanisms. To Mr. Lowell belongs the distinction
                    of being the <pb id="VAA2342-074" n="74"/> only one of our most eminent authors, and the only one of
                    our most eminent scholars who has given careful attention to American dialects. But while I have not
                    ventured to discuss the provincialisms of the Indiana backwoods, I have been careful to preserve the
                    true <hi rend="i">usus loquendi</hi> of each locution, and I trust my little story may afford
                    material for some one better qualified than I to criticise the dialect.&quot;</p>
                <p>That hope has never been fulfilled. No scholar has yet undertaken the philological task suggested.
                    But &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; has exercised a still more valuable influence upon
                    American letters. It has been the direct inspiration of the many recent Indiana writers who, in
                    prose and verse, have created a Hoosier literature of enduring worth. Indeed, it is scarcely too
                    much to claim for that pioneer work that it gave a broader impulse than even that, that it set the
                    example of utilizing local conditions, and depicting provincial character, in ways <pb
                        id="VAA2342-075" n="75"/> that are now common to the writers of fiction in every quarter of the
                    country. Before &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; appeared, only Bret Harte had in any
                    considerable degree departed in that direction from the beaten paths of prose fiction, and his work
                    had to do with phenomenal social conditions, the result of accident, as it were, and quite radically
                    different from those that existed in other parts of the country, and that the success of
                    &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; first taught our novelists to use as material.</p>
                <p>It should be explained that the dialect and the manners that were associated with it, were found
                    chiefly in the remoter country districts. But some traces of them were discoverable even among those
                    well-to-do farmers and landowners whose thrift and ambition, even as early as the forties, had
                    dotted the region along the Ohio river with spacious brick dwellingsmost of them with stately
                    colonnaded porticoes in front and ornamented lawns surrounding them. Association always <pb
                        id="VAA2342-076" n="76"/> does that much for a dialect. Henry Ward Beecher never cured himself
                    of the provincial New England pronunciation of &quot;new&quot; and &quot;dew,&quot;
                    and of &quot;house,&quot; &quot;cow,&quot; and the like. It has taken the efforts of
                    three generations of highly cultured school teachers in New England to root out the slighter
                    provincialisms of speech which even the educated classes there had adopted in childhood from the
                    less cultivated and more numerous class.</p>

                    backwoods life of Southern Indiana than ever before, and his recollection of things observed at that
                    time furnished no small part of his materials when in later years he came to the task of writing
                    &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; and &quot;The End of the World.&quot;</p>
                <p>In Decatur county there lived Captain William Lowry, our mother&apos;s uncle. He was a veteran of
                    the war of 1812, and as a young man he had &quot;located&quot; a large tract of government
                    land in that region, becoming its owner by virtue of the land warrant given to him by the government
                    in reward of his military service. To this domain he had made large additions by pur <pb
                        id="VAA2342-078" n="78"/> chasing the land warrants of other discharged volunteers. He thus
                    became the largest landowner, and in the end the most prosperous man in all that region.</p>
                <p>When he settled there about 1818 he had no white man for neighbor within twenty miles of him. Indians
                    were all about, but the pioneer knew how to deal with them in peace-procuring ways. Literal wolves
                    often howled at his house by night, but the energetic pioneer and soldier never at any time
                    confronted the metaphorical &quot;wolf at the door.&quot; He conquered his worst enemy when
                    he cleared the dense forests from such lands as he meant to convert into fields, and from the
                    beginning he relied upon himself for the satisfaction of all his own and his family&apos;s
                    needs. As the region settled somewhat, he became its most influential citizen, the one to whom every
                    one in misfortune appealed for counsel and assistance, the one whose word went furthest in the
                    decision of all questions of local public concern.</p>

                <p>His family grew rapidly, as it was the custom of families in that time and country to do. But under
                    the primitive way of living then practiced, the multiplication of children was a help rather than a
                    hindrance to prosperity.</p>
                <p>And Captain William Lowry never departed from that primitive way of living. To the end of his days he
                    and his boys and girls produced for themselves everything that they needed to eat, drink and wear,
                    with the exception of salt, coffee, tea, and, toward the end, a calico gown now and then as a bit of
                    finery for the women folk. On the farm itself the cotton and wool needed for clothing were grown,
                    carded, spun, woven and fashioned into garments. The blankets on the beds, as well as the quilts and
                    sheets and pillow-casesthese latter made always of home-grown linenwere produced in like manner. The
                    &quot;sugar camp &quot;a vast grove of sugar maple trees yielded all the sugar and molasses
                    used on the <pb id="VAA2342-081" n="80"/> place. From the orchards came, besides a great store of
                    apples, an abundance of cider and vinegar, apple butter, peach butter, dried fruits, and a product
                    which I have never seen or heard of elsewhere, but which I regarded as a rare delicacy in my
                    boyhood, namely cider molasses. The dairy yielded milk, cream, cheese and butter in lavish
                    abundance. The poultry yards produced more than the home demand called for, but the surplus was
                    never sold. Much of it was given away in my time to less fortunate folk who, either by reason of the
                    poverty of unthrift, or because of their misfortune in living in the village near by, were unable to
                    supply themselves with such things. Beef, pork, bacon and mutton were all products of the farm. The
                    grain was ground in near-by water mills, the miller taking toll for grinding it.</p>
                <p>I think in all his life this &quot;uncle Will&quot; of ours never had a servant or a hired
                    helper of any kind in his house. All the work of the household was done by the members of <pb
                        id="VAA2342-082" n="81"/> the family working together in willing cooperation, making something
                    of a frolic out of much of the work, and not one of them ever having work enough to do to bring
                    weariness as its reward.</p>
                <p>The house was a generously hospitable one. There was rarely a time when there were not some of the
                    numerous relatives staying there, as all of them so loved to do, and the place was a kind of Mecca
                    to them all. Strangers were entertained, too, whenever their paths led them into that region, but no
                    presence, whether of visiting kinsfolk, or of passing strangers, was ever suffered to make the
                    smallest difference in the family life. Whether there were many guests or none in the house there
                    was always an abundantly laden table and beds in plenty. There was singing in the evening, and, if
                    the weather was cold, there was always a gathering of children, and often of young men and maidens,
                    around the great wood fires where nuts were cracked and apples <pb id="VAA2342-083" n="82"/>
                    roasted, while one or more of the girls played a merrily humming accompaniment on her spinning
                    wheel. Some of the girls liked spinningsome did not. Those who liked it did it; those that did not,
                    let it alone. That was the spirit in which all things were done in the house and on the farm.</p>
                <p>SomethingI know not whatinduced our mother, about 1850, to close our home in Vevay and send Edward
                    and me to this pioneer home to live for a year or more. Edward remained on the farm for only a brief
                    time, after which he went to the neighboring village of Milford, or Clifty, in order that he might
                    &quot;clerk&quot; in a store there and pursue his studies under tuition of a young man in
                    the store who had had some educational advantages. But as the village lay only about a mile away,
                    Edward was often at the farm, and saw much of its peculiar and interesting life. He saw much else,
                    too, during that year, which he afterwards turned to literary account.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-084" n="83"/>
                <p>At the time of our stay there, Decatur county was completely and typically a &quot;back
                    woods&quot; region. Only a small part of the scattered population had attended even such schools
                    as existed in the country districts of Southern Indiana. Only here and there chiefly in Greensburg,
                    the county seat,was there a young man who had spent a year in boarding school. The majority of the
                    men and women in that primitive and sparsely settled country were illiterate, or very nearly so, not
                    so much by any fault of their own as because they had lacked opportunity. The only school-house I
                    can now remember in all the region round about, was one which our great-uncle, Captain Lowry, had
                    built on the outskirts of his own farm, to be used rent free by any wandering schoolmaster who might
                    succeed in securing &quot;scholars&quot; enough to justify him in keeping school. This
                    happened only occasionally. It happened once during our year in Decatur county. At that time a man
                    named Higgins opened <pb id="VAA2342-085" n="84"/> a pay school there, and taught it for three
                    months. He eked out the meagre income derived from the school by teaching a singing school every
                    Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning.</p>
                <p>There was an abundance of volume in his voice, I remember, but his only knowledge of music consisted
                    of an ability to sing by &quot;numeral notes,&quot; a system then much in vogue in the
                    remoter parts of the country. Instead of a musical scale, there were two parallel lines between
                    which numbers were printed. One stood for do, two for re, three for <hi rend="i">mi</hi>, four for
                        <hi rend="i">fah</hi>, and so on to eight, which stood for <hi rend="i">do</hi> again. If a
                    numeral was printed above or below the parallel lines it indicated that it was to be sung an octave
                    above or below. Instead of soprano, bass, alto and tenor, the four parts were tenor, treble, counter
                    and bass, the word tenor signifying the &quot;air&quot; of the tune, to be sung by soprano
                    voices. That use of the word was logical and etymological at any rate.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-086" n="85"/>
                <p>The singing school was maintained by subscriptionjust as more pretentious operas and concerts are at
                    present. And like our opera, its sessions constituted important social functions. All the young men
                    of the neighborhood subscribed the price fixed upon. The young women were deemed to contribute their
                    sufficient share merely by gracing the sessions with their presence. The little boys and girls also
                    came without charge.</p>
                <p>The singing school was in many ways a minister to culture of the backwoods kind, to social
                    intercourse and to courtship and marriage. Young men in that region never escorted young women to
                    singing school or to church; but when the exercises in either case were at an end, every young man
                    who could screw his courage up &quot;to the sticking point,&quot; would mount his horse,
                    ride up to the side of the damsel he wished to cultivate, and stammeringly ask her &quot;May I
                    see you safe home?&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-087" n="86"/>
                <p>There was good reason for trepidation, indeed. For the &quot;eternal feminine&quot; was as
                    strongly self-assertive in those young women of the backwoods as it is in any belle of our day,
                    while their disposition to assert themselves in rather free and easy ways was not curbed by any
                    excessive regard for the nicer courtesies of life. If a young man&apos;s attentions were
                    unwelcome to the girl chosen for their object, or if the girl happened to be pretty and inclined to
                    coquetry, she was apt to bring a rude and well worn wit to bear for his discomfiture. When, in the
                    conventional phrase, he asked &quot;May I see you safe home?&quot; she would answer
                    &quot;Yes, if you&apos;ll ride on ahead and sit on our front fence till I get
                    there.&quot; There were other formulas sometimes used on either side, but the one given will
                    serve as a sufficient example.</p>
                <p>For the most part the girls graciously accepted the proffered escort, unless the man offering it
                    happened to be especially dis <pb id="VAA2342-088" n="87"/> agreeable, or unless, by superior
                    promptitude, his offer of escort had anticipated that of some other and more favored youth, upon
                    whose present coming the girl counted with hope and confidence.</p>
                <p>Even in this unvarnished society there were well understood conventions governing social intercourse.
                    Upon arriving at her home the girl&apos;s behavior toward her escort very nicely marked the
                    extent of her favor, or the lack of it. If she thanked him for his attention, and dismissed him with
                    a prompt &quot;good-day,&quot; it meant that he had had his trouble for his pains, or
                    something like that. If she were a trifle more gracious, and bade him call again, it signified that
                    she liked him well enough, but was, as yet, at least a trifle indifferent to any attractions he
                    might possess. If she invited him to &quot;have dinner with us,&quot; the fact involved at
                    least so much of &quot;encouragement&quot; as might justify him in further attempts to win
                    her favor. Of course, the tone and manner in each case <pb id="VAA2342-089" n="88"/> modified the
                    general significance of the words, as they always do when maidens are at the age of choosing and are
                    dealing with possible or probable suitors. Such things &quot;come by nature&quot; to women
                    of the backwoods as surely as to women of the drawingroom.</p>
                <p>The sturdy virtues of manliness, honesty and industry among men, and a proud selfrespect among women,
                    were strongly marked in this typically western, backwoods community. But many petty superstitions
                    survived among them, and even the more intelligent of them were credulous in strange ways. The
                    scientific habit of mind was completely lacking. The weather warnings of patent medicine almanacs
                    were accepted as confidently as the advertised nostrums themselves were taken, in spite of the
                    frequent failure of both. Young women swallowed chickens&apos; hearts whole with incantations
                    that were believed to smooth the pathway of true love. Such physicians as lived <pb id="VAA2342-090"
                        n="89"/> in those parts found annoyingly successful rivals in practice in the persons of
                    ignorant old crones,such as Edward described in Granny Sanders,whose simples, gathered at the right
                    time of the moon, were firmly believed to work well-nigh miraculous cures. Still more confident was
                    the popular faith in the pretensions of certain claimants to occult powers. I remember hearing a
                    weird and awe-inspiring tale of the success of one of these in curing disease without so much as
                    seeing his patient. The story was told to me in the dense forest, during a &apos;coon hunt at
                    midnight. It was related that some man in chopping wood had split his own foot nearly in two; that
                    after hours of effort, the physician who had been called in declared that he could in no way stop
                    the hemorrhage, and that the man must bleed to death; that thereupon a messenger was sent at
                    midnight to wake the occult healer and invoke his assistance; that the man of mysterious powers,
                    without rising from his bed, had <pb id="VAA2342-091" n="90"/> bidden the messenger return, for that
                    the bleeding was now stopped; and finally, that it did cease at precisely the time of the
                    healer&apos;s declaration of the fact.</p>
                <p>Let us not laugh too derisively over the credulity of a simple, unlearned people as illustrated in
                    this story. Let us reflect that even in our highly scientific time, in our most advanced
                    communities, there are scores of thousands of educated men and women who not only believe in
                    healings equally absurd, but are almost belligerent in their assertion of their faith, and quite
                    lavish in their gifts of money for the building of marble temples in which to teach and propagate
                    their doctrine of &quot;absent treatment&quot; by faith alone. A foolish credulity seems
                    quite as prevalent among the educated people of an enlightened time as among those who lacked the
                    knowledge and the intellectual training which are supposed to eradicate such credulity from the
                    mind. Superstition is, perhaps, a matter of mental constitution rather than of mental <pb
                        id="VAA2342-092" n="91"/> condition as affected by education. Years after he had finished his
                    work of portraying the rude ignorance of the Hoosiers, Edward Eggleston wrote &quot;The Faith
                    Doctor,&quot; to show forth the worse credulity of men and women who had not the
                    Hoosiers&apos; plea of ignorance to excuse their weakness of mind.</p>
                <p>In this interior county the Hoosier dialect was far more generally employed than in the regions along
                    the Ohio river. In the river counties there was a considerable number of educated families in which
                    the speech of the children was jealously guarded against contamination. In Decatur there were no
                    such families, the best educated people there except for a doctor here and there, and possibly a
                    preacher or twowere such as had received nothing more than the training of the country schools,
                    supplemented in a very few cases by a year or less in some country boarding school.</p>
                <p>The people were all Americansnearly all Hoosiers by birth. The few who, like <pb id="VAA2342-093"
                        n="92"/> Captain Lowry, had been born in Kentucky, had lived so long in Indiana as to be in no
                    marked way unlike their Hoosier-born neighforeigners there, and no persons of immediate descent from
                    foreigners, to influence the dialect. There was, indeed, no modifying influence of any kind to serve
                    as a corrective. The schoolmaster, Higgins, already mentioned, made some effort in that direction,
                    but it was badly misguided. He taught us to give full orthopic force to the &quot;w&quot; in
                    &quot;sword,&quot; and the &quot;t&quot; in &quot;often&quot; and
                    &quot;soften,&quot; to pronounce the word &quot;only&quot; with a short
                    &quot;o,&quot; and &quot;Niagara&quot; as if it had been spelled
                    &quot;Nee-ogg-ara.&quot; The Yankee schoolmistress, with her trained intelligence, was
                    bravely combating the dialect and the ignorance, of which it was a symptom, in the river towns. But
                    she had not yet appeared in the interior.</p>
                <p>In such homes as that of Captain Lowry it was the custom to subscribe for one or <pb id="VAA2342-094"
                        n="93"/> two weekly story papers. The favorites were the <hi rend="i">Cincinnati Dollar
                    Times</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Saturday Evening Post</hi> of Philadelphia, and the <hi rend="i">Flag
                        of Our Union</hi>, published in Boston. The serials and short stories published in these
                    periodicals were of no particular value, but they were at any rate quite harmless, and they were
                    entertaining to simple minds. It was the practice to have them read aloud by the evening fireside,
                    after which the papers con taining them were loaned to such of the neighbors as could read them but
                    were too poor to subscribe.</p>
                <p>There was no library of any kind anywhere in all that region, and I cannot remember that, during our
                    stay of a year in Decatur county, I ever saw in any house a book, other than school text books, with
                    the exception of a paper-bound temperance novel by T. S. Arthur.</p>
                <p>The only educative influence that was brought to bear was that of the preachers, chiefly Methodists.
                    It would be difficult to <pb id="VAA2342-095" n="94"/> exaggerate the service to civilization
                    rendered by the itinerant circuit riders of that peculiarly militant church, at a time when, to
                    quote from &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster,&quot; the West &quot;bade fair to become a
                    perdition as bad as any that Brother Sodom ever depicted.&quot;</p>
                <p>These traveling Methodist preachers were, in many cases, men of scanty education, but they knew by
                    heart the message they were charged to deliver, and they were mightily in earnest. Their speech
                    might be ungrammatical at times, but their zeal was white hot with the fervor of conviction, and
                    their eloquence lost nothing of effectiveness by reason of the rudeness of their rhetoric or the
                    inaccuracy of their diction. Each of those men firmly believed that he had been called of God to
                    this service, and each felt as the Apostle did&quot;Woe is me if I preach not the
                    gospel.&quot;</p>
                <p>The itinerant system, too, was peculiarly well adapted to the time and country. It <pb
                        id="VAA2342-096" n="95"/> effectually prevented the Methodist preachers from forming local tics
                    of any kind or creating local prejudices that might impair their effectiveness. It, and the poverty
                    which accompanied it, kept them footloose of all worldly things, and made of their ministry the one
                    concern of their lives. Their work was essentially missionary in character, and its effectiveness
                    was as pronounced as had been that of the Jesuit missionarics, of an earlier time, among the Indians
                    and half-breeds.</p>
                <p>The theology of these men was often harsh, and it was always rude and literal in its interpretations,
                    but it was such as the people to whom they preached could understand and accept. They believed in
                    the literal inspiration of the Scriptures, and they interpreted the Bible, in its English version,
                    which alone they knew, with absolute confidence that every word was true, and that every word meant
                    precisely what it appeared to mean. They believed in an actual hell, <pb id="VAA2342-097" n="96"/>
                    of fire and brimstone, and they preached that doctrine as a truth which could not be doubted, and
                    need not be argued. God had said it, and there was an end of discussion. They believed in a personal
                    devil, and in his constant presence at every elbow as the tempter to sin.</p>
                <p>The effect of the preaching of these earnest men as a morally educative force in a rude and ignorant
                    community, was of necessity very great. Even when it influenced men&apos;s minds chiefly through
                    fear, it prompted them to good conduct as one of the necessary means of keeping out of an eternal
                    hell of quenchless fire.</p>
                <p>But the preachers were educators in other ways. They were themselves better educated than men in that
                    community generally were, for though many of them began their work with exceedingly meagre schooling
                    behind it, they were subject, as preachers, to the ceaseless and perfectly fearless admonition of
                    older ministers, and especially of <pb id="VAA2342-098" n="97"/> their &quot;Presiding
                    Elders,&quot; whose duty it was to give minute attention to the conduct, methods and training of
                    the ministers under their jurisdiction. Their admonitory supervision was supported by adequate
                    ecclesiasti cal authority, and their advice was accepted as a command.</p>
                <p>Sometimes ludicrous results occurred. I remember one case related in my presence by an old Presiding
                    Elder. He said that upon one occasion, when going down the Ohio river on a steamboat, he had for
                    companion a youthful minister whose bringing up had been of the rudest kind. The two were assigned
                    to a single stateroom, and the Presiding Elder, observing in the young man a regrettable neglect of
                    personal cleanliness, gently reproved him. Among other things he told the uncouth youth that he
                    should brush his teeth every morning. The young man meekly accepted the chiding as a godly
                    admonition, and in the morning when the two arose, he said to his mentor, &quot;I&apos;m
                    going to <pb id="VAA2342-099" n="98"/> begin at once, and this morning I have used your tooth-brush.
                    When we go ashore I&apos;ll buy one for myself.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;No,&quot; answered the older man, scarcely able to suppress a laugh, &quot;you may
                    spare yourself that expense. In recognition of your effort to profit by my suggestions,
                    I&apos;ll make you a present of that tooth-brush.&quot;</p>
                <p>The Presiding Elders gave attention also to the studies of the younger men, for certain studies were
                    marked out for them by ecclesiastical authority, with a view to the repair of their educational
                    deficiencies. Chief among these studies was English grammar, through the diligent study of which it
                    was hoped that every young minister would presently learn to use a better English than that which he
                    had learned from association. This result was not always realized. I well remember that one able and
                    even eloquent preacher, past middle life, and sufficiently prominent to be assigned successively to
                    the charge of the best churches in the larger <pb id="VAA2342-100" n="99"/> towns, always said that
                    &quot;John the Baptist had went out into the wilderness.&quot;</p>
                <p>One who had served long as Presiding Elder, used to tell of a minister who, when called to account
                    for his persistently ungrammatical speech, tearfully expressed regret, and added:
                    &quot;Brethren, I can&apos;t help it. For years I have carried a grammar in my hat, but for
                    the life of me I can&apos;t get it into my head.&quot;</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these occasional failures of the system, the young preachers generally improved
                    rapidly under this educational system, so that as a rule the pulpit was an exemplar of a much better
                    rhetorical usage than any that the people heard else where; more important still, these preachers
                    were expected to read the weekly denomina tional newspapers, together with a book now and then, so
                    that their intellectual field of vision became somewhat larger than that of the majority of the
                    people to whom they preached.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-101" n="100"/>
                <p>At the time of Edward Eggleston&apos;s stay in Decatur county, there survived in that region a
                    band of outlaws, with whose doings Edward became acquainted through the arrest and trial of some of
                    them. In earlier days it had been the practice of these men to follow travelers on the highway, and
                    rob and sometimes kill them in secluded places along the road. In aid of their nefarious business,
                    they leagued with themselves a number of roadside innkeepers. Soon after the luckless traveler
                    established himself at an inn, two or three of the gang, pretending to be strangers in those parts,
                    would ride up and ask accommodations for the night. That done, the robbery was easily managed, and
                    the victim, stripped of every valuable possession, including his horse, was left to pursue his
                    journey penniless and on foot.</p>
                <p>Popular indignation over such occurrences led to a lynching or two, and the bolder operations of the
                    gang were brought <pb id="VAA2342-102" n="101"/> to an end. The former highwaymen degenerated into
                    burglars and petty thieves. But during Edward Eggleston&apos;s stay in Milford, or Cliffy, as
                    the little village in Decatur county was variously called, the band was reorganized for predatory
                    purposes, by a man of considerable education, great shrewdness and, to all appearance, conspicuously
                    blameless life. Its headquarters in the older highway robbery times had been in the adjoining county
                    of Ripley. But the new master of the organization lived at Clifty, and, under his directions, its
                    operations were carried on mainly in Decatur county.</p>
                <p>The secret organization was at last discovered and broken up. Some of its members, unable to give
                    bail, were tried, convicted and sent to the penitentiary. Some failed of conviction for lack of
                    sufficient evidence. These were forced to leave the county and the State under threats of lynching.
                    The highly moral leader of the gang gave bail, forfeited it and disappeared. He <pb id="VAA2342-103"
                        n="102"/> was the original of Dr. Small in &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward was only a boy at the time of the discovery of this gang, and the shock of this revelation of
                    depravity on the part of men whom he had been accustomed to see in the guise of good citizens, so
                    afflicted his sensitive mind that for a time he fell ill. It was altogether natural that, when he
                    came to write his first novel of Hoosier life, he should draw upon this memory of his boyhood for
                    the materials of his plot.</p>
                <p>It was during that year, in the real backwoods, too, that he made his most fruitful observations of
                    Hoosier life, Hoosier character and the Hoosier dialect. For there, for the first and only time in
                    his life, he encountered these things in their purity, unmixed with anything higher or better. He
                    learned to know how much of human goodness, how much of manly and womanly virtue there may be among
                    people of homely appearance, uncouth manners and rude speech <pb id="VAA2342-104" n="103"/> He here
                    saw human nature undisguised by the artificialities of culture, and learned to respect it and love
                    it for what it is, rather than for anything it pretends to be.</p>
                <p>How valuable all this was to him as a preparation for the work he was destined to do in life, will be
                    best seen by the reader who realizes the unity of that work. In his novels of the Hoosier life, and
                    the early life of Minnesota, Edward Eggleston was minutely depicting certain phases of that
                    &quot;Life in the United States &quot;which in later years he chose as his special field of
                    historical research and historical writing. In those later novels, whose scenes were in other
                    fields, he was inspired by a like purpose to show forth phases of American life which had come under
                    his close personal observation. In his novels quite as truly as in &quot;The Beginners of a
                    Nation&quot; and &quot;The Transit of Civilization,&quot; he was writing history of that
                    kind which most strongly appealed to his mindhistory which concerns <pb id="VAA2342-105" n="104"/>
                    itself far less with public events than with the life forces, the manners, circumstances, influences
                    and ways of thinking among the people, out of which not only public events but institutions
                    themselves have grown. In his view every detail of the popular life and thought was of importance,
                    every circumstance that had influenced men&apos;s lives and men&apos;s minds was worth
                    recording. These things he held to be the seeds of history, and in all his work, whether fiction or
                    formal history, it was his endeavor to study these seeds, to recall their sprouting, and to discover
                    in their growth the origin of the institutions, the habits, the customs, the life of our later time.</p>
                <p>This thought is not mine but his, though I present it with less of reserve than his modesty exacted
                    of him when he first communicated it to me.</p>
                <p>This he did in a letter written to me from Europe early in 1880. In it he told me that he purposed to
                    devote the next ten <pb id="VAA2342-106" n="[]"/>

                    should constitute a &quot;History of Life in the United States.&quot;</p>
                <p>In that letter concerning his plans and purposes, he said something like this to me:</p>
                <p>&quot;After all this work will not differ in essentials from what I have been doing hitherto. The
                    historical form is more ambitious or perhaps you will say more pretentious but, as I look back over
                    my work in fiction, I begin to see clearly that every chapter of it was inspired by the same purpose
                    that actuates me now. My interest in my work has been that of a student intent upon tracing the
                    forces of life in America to their origins, and showing how men and women lived and thought and
                    felt, under conditions that existed before those of to-day came into being. So that I am not making
                    a new departure now or entering a new field. I have been writing history all the time in my novels.
                    I am going now to write the same kind of history, in a somewhat different form.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-108" n="106"/>
                <p>I cannot offer the foregoing passage as a quotation. But the facts recorded in it deeply impressed me
                    at the time, and I am certain that my paraphrase of the words is substantially accurate, though made
                    only from memory. The thought that underlies them seems to me a fruitful one, helpful to every
                    reader who would justly understand the purpose of a life work that has gained for its author a high
                    place in the esteem and affection of his fellow men.</p>

                <head type="subtitle">The Environment of the Hoosier Boy.</head>
                <p>D<hi rend="sc">URING</hi> our year in Decatur county our mother was married to the Rev. Williamson
                    Terrell, a Methodist minister of ability and some culture. After a few months Edward and I were
                    summoned to our new home in New Albany, where Mr. Terrell was pastor of the principal church.</p>
                <p>Edward&apos;s health was now so much strengthened by his year of backwoods life that he
                    resumedhis studies in a rather pretentious but fairly good &quot;Collegiate Institute,&quot;
                    presided over by one Ayer or Ayres. The boy had acquired a speaking acquaintance with French while
                    living as a child among the Swiss in Vevay. This language he took up again at the Collegiate
                    Institute, and there he began the study of Latin and <pb id="VAA2342-110" n="108"/> algebra and
                    geometry, having completed his mastery of arithmetic under tuition of the young store-clerk at
                    Ciifty.</p>
                <p>As usual his ambition and his almost preternatural energy in study outran his strength andquickly
                    exhausted it. He quitted school after a month or two, but in that time he had learnedenough of Latin
                    to rend Carsar, and as soon as the first severity of his illness was past he returned to his
                    studies, with only himself for his master. Almost all his education was got in that way, indeed. He
                    rarely attended any school for more than a few weeks, or a few monthsat most, before falling ill.
                    But except while the attack of illness was at its worst, he never ceased to study.</p>
                <p>When he could no longer attend school, and when a wise exercise of parental authority imposed certain
                    sharp limitations upon his hours of self-imposed study, he joined with me in a number of boyish
                    occupations of a time-killing character. 1 was at that <pb id="VAA2342-111" n="109"/> period of my
                    life neither disposed nor accustomed to waste the hours out of school in the drudgery of study. I
                    had a faculty of quick perception and a positively glutinous memory, so that half an hour&apos;s
                    work over my books each evening was quite all I needed to enahle me to maintain a good standing in
                    my classes. Had I been ambitious of distinction in school another half hour of study each evening
                    would easily have placed and kept me at the very head of all my classes. I was content, however,
                    with a place in the upper half of them, and I gave allthe rest of the hours out of school, and the
                    whole of every Saturday, to recreation. In company with a chum of mine, I moulded and burnt
                    miniature brickseach bearing the initials of the two young manufacturers, in relief, upon its
                    surface. Edward would have nothing to do with this &quot;mud-pie making&quot; as he called
                    it; but when Charley Van Dusen and I advanced a step, and, from being brickmakers, became architects
                    and builders, Edward <pb id="VAA2342-112" n="110"/> interested himself in our work, helping us to
                    construct Greek and Roman temples out of our little bricks, and incidentally teaching us something
                    of the achievements of the ancients in art and architecture. He related to us also, pretty nearly
                    all he knew of classical mythology, adopting a method which I remember was puzzling and painful to
                    my more prosaic mind. Thus, when we would wander on a Saturday out among the
                    &quot;knobs,&quot; as the hills near New Albany were called, Edward would sit down in the
                    woods, by a waterfall, and say to me something like this:</p>
                <p>&quot;We are in a spirit-haunted woodland now; let me tell you about it. The reason that
                    waterfall is so beautiful is that a water nymph lives there and controls every drop of the water.
                    When we mortals are here she allows nothing to be seen except what we see now; but when there are no
                    mortals about, she gathers around her the wood sprites, and exhibits to them glories that are too
                        <pb id="VAA2342-113" n="111"/> great and too sacred for human eyes to look upon.&quot; Then
                    he would go on relating some Greek legend, making it local and telling it not as legend but as fact
                    known to him. In my boyish literalness, I remember, his words puzzled me greatly. I could not
                    believe that Edward was lying, though my fear that he was doing so, was strengthened by a complete
                    and constitutional disbelief in the occult, the supernatural and the mystical. That incredulity had
                    been fostered inmy mind by the teachings of my father and my mother, who, in fear that we should
                    imbibe superstition from the ignorance about us, had taken pains from our very infancy to guard
                    against such influences. Ghost stories had always been forbidden in our nursery, and even fairy
                    stories were permitted only when accompanied by an explanation of their character. So when Edward
                    localized his Greek legends and placed them in modern settings of scene and circumstance, I was
                    grievously puzzled by a conflict between un <pb id="VAA2342-114" n="112"/> belief in the
                    supernatural on the one hand, and my profound faith in Edward&apos;s truthfulness on the other.
                    After several repetitions of this experience, I made up my mind that in tellingthese stories Edward
                    was lying, and I was mightily troubled by a fear that he would be damnedfor doing so.</p>
                <p>In later years Edward was fond of relating an experience of his own and mine encounteredat this
                    timean experience which gave us our first lesson in commercial morality as it is sometimes
                    practiced.</p>
                <p>Among other things that we did at that period, was the manufacture of mussel-shell lime. We hit upon
                    this by accident, and at first sought only a domestic use for our product. It was a nearly
                    impalpable powder, and we found it to be a superior metal polish.</p>
                <p>One day Edward was seized with the thought that we might make a little pocket moneya rare thing with
                    usout of our discovery by putting it on the market. To <pb id="VAA2342-115" n="113"/> that end he
                    consulted a certain peripatetic scissors-grinder who was accustomed to pass our way once or twice a
                    week. He showed him experimentally how, by a little rubbing with our shelllime, a knife or pair of
                    scissors could be made to &quot;look like new,&quot; and asked for the
                    scissors-grinder&apos;s advice as to means by which to market our product. Edward was shrewd
                    enough to withhold from the man all information as to our processes of manufacture, but at that
                    point unhappily his sagacity ceased.</p>
                <p>The scissors-grinder eagerly offered to become our agent.</p>
                <p>&quot;You boys furnish me the stuff,&quot; he said, &quot;and I&apos;ll sell it. I
                    can put it into every house in town. But what shall we call it? We must have a good name for it.
                    That means a lot.&quot;</p>
                <p>So Edward began cudgeling his brains for a name. Finally, as he looked across the street, his eye
                    caught sight of some Venetian window blinds, which had been newly painted <pb id="VAA2342-116"
                        n="114"/> of an intenser and grassier green than was usual, and he suggested that we should call
                    our powder &quot;Venetian Polish.&quot; To this suggestion the scissors-grinder added
                    another. &quot;A thing ought to be called French,&quot; he said, &quot;if
                    you&apos;re going to sell it. Let&apos;s call it &apos;French Venetian
                    Polish.&apos;&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward&apos;s conscience was not geographical in its tendencies, and so the suggestion was
                    accepted. He and I made a considerable quantity of the &quot;French Venetian Polish,&quot;
                    packed it inpasteboard boxes of our own manufacture, and delivered it to the scissors-grinder for
                    sale oncommission. He sold it readily enough on its merits, but he not only pocketed the total
                    proceeds of the sales, but managed to discover what the &quot;French Venetian Polish&quot;
                    was made of and how it was made. After that he made it for himself, and the only good thing we two
                    boys got out of our discovery was experience.</p>
                <p>After six months or so of our resi <pb id="VAA2342-117" n="115"/> dence in New Albany, Mr.
                    Terrell&apos;s pastorate came to the end appointed for it under the itinerant system, and he was
                    transferred to the charge of Wesley Chapel, in Madison, to which citythe family removed.</p>
                <p>As illustrative of the life and thought of that time, I may explain that an assignment to the
                    pastorate of Wesley Chapel was a matter of some perplexity to the ecclesiastical authorities. Wesley
                    Chapel was the most fashionable Methodist church, in the wealthiest and most fashionable city in all
                    Southern Indiana. The church, though calling itself a chapel, was suspected, if not of popish
                    inclinations, at least of a tendency toward Episcopalian formalism. Wesley Chapel had set up a
                    choir, not to monopolize the singing, but to lead and guide it, and the fact was regarded with grave
                    doubt as an innovation of very dangerous tendency. Although the appointment to the pastorate of
                    Wesley Chapel was justly regarded as financially, socially and in other ways the <pb
                        id="VAA2342-118" n="116"/> very best within the gift of the bishop who presided over that
                    Conference, there were not many ministers willing to accept it, and still fewer to whom the bishop
                    was willing to entrust it. As the congregation was composed of some of the best educated people in
                    tin little city, the clergyman assigned to its pastorate must be a man of ability and intellectual
                    attainments. As the church insisted upon maintaining a choir, and was suspected of a strong though
                    still dormant longing for an organ, there were many of the ministers who felt conscientious scruples
                    of a very grave nature about accepting a pastorate which might seem at least to commit them to
                    tolerance, if not to approval of such ritualistic departures from the simplicity of Methodist
                    doctrine and practice. On the other hand, there were some ministers in the Conference who would have
                    been pleased to be assigned to Wesley Chapel, in order that they mightuse all they had of
                    ecclesiastical authority and pastoral influence <pb id="VAA2342-119" n="117"/> for the suppression
                    of the choir and the restoration of Methodist simplicity within that erring church. These wanted to
                    &quot;make a row,&quot; and the wise bishops did not want a &quot;row.&quot;</p>
                <p>In our more enlightened time it is difficult to understand the intellectual attitude of half a
                    century ago, upon matters of this kind. But no history of that time would be even approximately
                    complete if it did not include some attempt, at least, to illustrate this point.</p>
                <p>Roman Catholics were at that time both feared and hated. They were accounted idolaters andworshipers
                    of graven images, and whatever in the remotest degree savored of Roman Catholic practice was looked
                    upon as a thing of devilish inspiration. I remember that I once suffered a period of enforced and
                    rather severe penance for the grave offence of having strayed into a Catholic church one week-day
                    afternoon, to hear the vesper music. And I remember hearing one <pb id="VAA2342-120" n="118"/> dear
                    old lady publicly censured for having expressed the belief that some, at least, of the Roman
                    Catholics might be admitted to heaven. The preacher who censured hera Baptist, I think he
                    wasexplained the matter very logically, and with all the narrowness and intolerance that logic
                    chopping usually breeds in half-instructed minds. He began by saying that idolatry was, of course, a
                    sin quite unpardonable of God, if not renounced and repented of; that Roman Catholics were clearly
                    idolators; that they must therefore, of necessity, be damned unless they repented and became
                    Protestants; and that in expressing the hope that some of them mightbe saved through the tender
                    mercies of God, the gentle-spirited old lady had been disloyalto the very fundamentals of faith, and
                    had lent her countenance to the heathen practice of worshiping idols.</p>
                <p>There was one Episcopal church in Madison. The other Protestant churches regarded it as merely a
                    slightly modified form <pb id="VAA2342-121" n="119"/> of the Roman Catholic communion. It had
                    stained glass windows. It had an allegorical painting on the window over the altar. It had a pipe
                    organ. Its rector read the service in a white gown and preached in a black one. Worse than all, that
                    church had a gilded cross surmounting its steeple. Was not the cross a sign and symbol of Roman
                    Catholicism? Was it not, in fact, one of the &quot;graven images&quot; which Roman Catholic
                    idolators wickedly worshiped? Were not Methodist girls, and girls of Baptist and Presbyterian
                    families strictly forbidden to use the cross as an ornament when they manufactured for themselves
                    out of crushed rose petals, a chain of beads?</p>
                <p>I suppose that at that time there was not in all the land, and I am certain there was not in Southern
                    Indiana, a single Methodist church which would have permitted the playing of any musical instrument
                    at its services, or the use of the cross in the church, or on the person of any of its con <pb
                        id="VAA2342-122" n="120"/> gregation. That which is properly the universal symbol of
                    Christianity, and is now everywhere recognized as such, was then held to be a Roman Catholic device
                    for the betrayal of human souls into the devil&apos;s possession.</p>
                <p>And the narrowness of mind which prompted such views, and which excluded everything of ornament from
                    the architecture and the furnishing of churches, and every ministry of taste and beauty from their
                    services, went much further than this in its pestilent and nagging interference. I remember with
                    what bitterness the clergyman under whose ministrations we sat in our early boyhood, denounced the
                    &quot;putting on of gold and costly apparel,&quot; even exhorting wives and widows to strip
                    off their wedding rings, as &quot;shackles that would bind them to the devil,&quot; to quote
                    the phrase I remember hearing that fervent preacher use in a burst of excited eloquence on this
                    theme. I remember, too, with what destructive oratorical <pb id="VAA2342-123" n="12"/> onslaughts
                    the preachers used to denounce the sinful wearing of &quot;artificials&quot;by which they
                    meant artificial flowersin women&apos;s bonnets. In one case a middle-aged and most sedate
                    widow, who was growing thin of visage under the burden of caring for a family on an all too meagre
                    income, was rather cruelly called to account in the presence of the congregation for having filled
                    out the hollow sides of her poke bonnet with a little white and black ruching. She had done so, she
                    explained, merely to hide the increasing hollowness of her cheeks, and to that plea the preacher
                    replied that in trying to do that she had been guilty of the sin of wilful deception.</p>
                <p>In Madison, and in other places at the time of our removal to Madison, the rigid puritanism that we
                    had known before had been somewhat softened by increasing culture, but in many ways it still reigned
                    and ruled with the strong hand. Sabbatarianism especially was rampant and very exigent in <pb
                        id="VAA2342-124" n="122"/> its demands, particularly among the Methodists. It was held to be
                    sinful to take a bath on Sunday, or to shave, or to brush one&apos;s shoes on that day. To buy
                    or sell the very simplest thing on Sunday was rigorously forbidden. No cooking of any kind was
                    permittedall that must be done on Saturdayand cold meals alone were permitted on what we were taught
                    to regard as the Sabbath.</p>
                <p>As a healthy and very active boy I fell into the habit, during one glorious June in Vevay, of walking
                    out into &quot;God&apos;s first temples,&quot; the woodlands, during the scant intervals
                    between religious services. At this the &quot;preacher in charge&quot; was gravely
                    disturbed. He made it the occasion of a pastoral visit to my mother, at that time a widow, trying to
                    bring up her children in the &quot;nurture and admonition of the Lord.&quot; After that I
                    was forbidden to indulge my sinful love of nature and compelled to pass my Sunday afternoons in
                    pretending to read &quot;Smiley on Class <pb id="VAA2342-125" n="123"/> Meetings,&quot;
                    &quot;Baxter&apos;s Saints&apos; Rest,&quot; and somebody&apos;s &quot;Plan
                    of Salvation.&quot; I say &quot;pretending to read&quot; these books, for my sense of
                    justice was deeply wounded by the requirement, and finding myself helpless to resist it in any other
                    way, I deliberately cheated it. Thus I was saved from the sin of breathing the Sunday air in the
                    glorious forest, and induced to practice a pious deception instead.</p>
                <p>My helpless little soul was often thus in blind revolt against teachings that I could neither
                    understand nor reconcile with the little I possessed of reason. Thus, when the Vevay boys went in
                    swimming on Sunday and one of them was drowned, it was explained by our preacher that the poor
                    fellow&apos;s deathundoubtedly followed by his damnationwas decreed by the Almighty as a just
                    punishment of his sin. This declaration sorely puzzled my mind. I asked myself whyif going in
                    swimming on Sunday was a sin deserving deaththe other boys <pb id="VAA2342-126" n="124"/> in the
                    party were not punished in like manner. Carrying this thought a little further, I argued that, if
                    the results were to be taken as an indication of the Divine view of the matter, the weight of the
                    evidence was overwhelmingly in favor of swimming on Sunday; for only one of the ten boys had been
                    drowned, while the other nine had received proof of God&apos;s approval by being permitted to
                    enjoy their bath without any punishment or any ill consequences whatever. Thus, it seemed to me, the
                    Divine verdict was nine to one in favor of the innocence of Sunday bathing in the river. I firmly
                    believed, of course, in the direct supervision of human affairs by Providence, and so I could not
                    doubt that this poor fellow&apos;s drowning was decreed as a punishment for something, but in
                    view of the escape of the other nine boys, I could not think that he was thus terribly and
                    irretrievably punished for an offence which brought no punishment at all to his comrades. He <pb
                        id="VAA2342-127" n="125"/> must have committed some other sin, I argued.</p>
                <p>Puzzled to the point of bewilderment, I dared not suggest my doubts to any grown person. I knew that
                    such a course would bring to me not enlightenment or explanation, but a terrible rebuke, with some
                    species of penance added for the purification of my soul. So I spoke only to Edward on the subject.
                    He was about eleven or twelve years old at the time, but my faith in his wisdom was boundless. No
                    counselnot even that of the preachercould have meant so much to me as his words always did.</p>
                <p>I laid the case before him, therefore, to his profound grief and sorrow. He had accepted as
                    indisputable every line and word of our religious teaching, and his conscience was a relentless
                    tyrant, governing his soul and controlling his conduct in every particular. It did so, indeed, to
                    the very end of his life, but enlarged knowledge and a sounder thinking, as he grew older, wrought
                        <pb id="VAA2342-128" n="126"/> in him an enlightenment of mind which set him free from the
                    bondage of narrow dogmatism to which as a boy he submitted himself, in full confidence that all the
                    things he had been taught were direct revelations of God&apos;s will and purposes.</p>
                <p>I wish to make this point clear. In all his life, I think, Edward Eggleston never permitted himself
                    to do any act that his conscience forbade, or to leave undone any duty that his conscience enjoined.
                    But while in childhood the dogmas in which he had been trained gave law to his thought, his
                    intellect, as he grew older, asserted its right to question the authority of those dogmas, and he
                    did so with utter fearlessness, and with the same conscientious courage that had in childhood led
                    him to obey at whatever cost.</p>
                <p>I do not remember many things so well as I remember the way in which he dealt with my doubts and
                    questionings on this occasion. Adopting the views at that time taught us <pb id="VAA2342-129"
                        n="127"/> from the pulpit, he suggested that my doubts were directly inspired by the devil for
                    the destruction of my soul, and perhaps also of his, for my presentation of the matter, he frankly
                    confessed, had awakened the spirit of doubt in his own mind. He could not resolve the matter, but
                    our best course, he suggested, would be to pray that we might not be led into temptation, and then
                    put the matter out of our minds. The insight, the critical acumen, and the enlightenment which
                    guided his thought so wisely in after life, had not yet come to the boy of a dozen years old.</p>
                <p>If details of this character seem trivial to any reader, my answer is that they are necessary to the
                    just fulfilment of the two purposes with which this work is written. Those purposes are first to
                    trace the development of Edward Eggleston&apos;s mind, and second to present the completest
                    picture I can of the life, the ideas and the tendencies of the time in which he was born and reared,
                        <pb id="VAA2342-130" n="128"/> as a part of that &quot;culture history,&quot; that
                    history of life in the United States which he made the theme of all his literary work, the object of
                    all his studies.</p>

                <p>AT the time of our removal to Madison that town was in many respects the most important city in
                    Indiana. It was distinctly the wealthiest of all of them, and the busiest.</p>
                <p>A little while earlier Madison had been indisputably the largest of Indiana cities. It still disputed
                    with Indianapolis and New Albany the supremacy in population, a claim the census of 1850 negatived,
                    while in point of businessthough signs of decline and decay were beginning to appearMadison still
                    held an undisputed lead. The census of 1850 showed the population of the little city to be 8012. A
                    foot-note to the census report places it at 12,000 in 1852, though upon what authority does not
                    appear. At that time its people &quot;claimed&quot; a population of <pb id="VAA2342-132"
                        n="130"/> 20,000 or more. Then, as now, ambitious cities had the faculty of growing with
                    extraordinary rapidity during the years when there was no census taking to correct the figures of
                    the &quot;claims.&quot;</p>
                <p>Madison lies on the Ohio river, about ninety miles below Cincinnati, and about forty miles above
                    Louisville. In those days the river was the one great highway, both of travel and of commerce. It
                    was the endeavor of both to reach the river in the shortest, speediest and least expensive way
                    possible. The enterprise of the early investors in Madison had wisely availed itself of this fact.
                    They had secured the building of one of the earliest railroads in the Statethe very earliest I
                    thinkfrom Madison to Indianapolis. With this artery of commerce leading into the interior, Madison
                    quickly became the most important commercial city in the State. All the merchants in all the little
                    towns in the interior purchased their goods, of every kind, from the wholesale <pb id="VAA2342-133"
                        n="[]"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2342-5">

                    <pb id="VAA2342-134" n="131"/> houses in Madison. All the produce of all the farms was sent to
                    Madison, to be forwarded thence by river to distant markets, and all the travel followed the same
                    route. In addition to the daily, and at times twice daily, steamboats of the Louisville and
                    Cincinnati Mail Line, Madison had daily packet lines of her own, some to Cincinnati and some to
                    Louisville. There were frequent steamboats, stopping there, too, on their way from Cincinnati to New
                    Orleans or St. Louis. Still again, there were multitudinous flatboats, taking cargoes at the busy
                    little city for cheap transportation to New Orleans. The &quot;levee&quot; was a busy place,
                    and the street fronting it was solidly built up with forwarding and commission houses, grain, flour
                    and feed stores, establishments for the sale of provisions and boat stores, and other things of like
                    kind. Streets farther from the river front were filled with wholesale houses.</p>
                <p>Very naturally, the seat of so thriving a <pb id="VAA2342-135" n="132"/> commerce became a centre of
                    manufacturing industry also. There were several considerable foundries and machine shops there; an
                    extensive shipyard; two great breweries; several flour mills of large capacity; many cooper-shops,
                    planing mills, starch factories, lath works and a score or more of shops for minor manufacturing.</p>
                <p>Greatest of all the town&apos;s industries in importance was pork packing. During the Crimean war
                    Madison was indeed the most important seat of the pork packing industry in all the world.</p>
                <p>As wealth abounded in the town, luxury was there also. Residences were built, some of which would be
                    accounted fine even in our large cities of to-day, and life there took on aspects of ease and
                    serenity which strongly impressed the minds of us two Hoosier boys, who had seen nothing of the kind
                    before. The city was beautiful, with its broad, well shaded and smoothly graveled streets, and with
                    well ornamented grounds surrounding <pb id="VAA2342-136" n="133"/> all the best houses. In brief, I
                    may say truly that Madison, with its population of eight or ten thousand souls, wore the aspect of a
                    real city, as no other town north of the Ohio and west of Cincinnati could then pretend to do. It
                    alone looked like a city assuredly prosperous, and nowhere shabby with any appearance of raw
                    newness. It alone of all the towns in Indiana had great banking houses of its own to support its
                    commerce and its industries. Notable among these banking houses at that time was that of Winslow,
                    Lanier &amp; Co., which, when the trade of Madison fell into decay, removed to New York and
                    became a recognized financial power in the metropolis.</p>
                <p>As has been said already, Madison was just beginning to decline in trade and importance at the time
                    of our removal to the city, and the decay proceeded rapidly during our stay there and afterwards.
                    Other railroads were building from Indianapolis to Cincinnati and Louisville, while still others
                    were <pb id="VAA2342-137" n="134"/> stretching their lines toward St. Louis, Chicago, and from
                    Indianapolis eastwardly to connect with railroads leading to New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore.</p>
                <p>All these lines tended to rob Madison of its business. They diverted its trade to other and greater
                    centres. They deprived the little city of the one advantage it had possessed. They took away its one
                    reason for being, as a commercial and industrial town.</p>
                <p>The decay was rapid. The imposing row of commission houses and their kind that fronted the river,
                    were closed in a succession so rapid as to be almost startling. The wholesale houses farther from
                    the river, which had enjoyed a great trade in dry goods, groceries, hardware, iron and nails,
                    crockery, cordage and other staples of commerce, presently followed the example thus set. Within a
                    year after we boys first knew the town, scarcely one of these establishments remained actively open.
                    The few that still <pb id="VAA2342-138" n="135"/> maintained a pretence of being in business did so
                    chiefly because their owners had made comfortable fortunes, liked Madison as a place of residence,
                    and enjoyed having in their stores and offices pleasant places in which to pass the daylight hours
                    in converse with their friends.</p>
                <p>But if Madison thus ceased to be a thriving seat of commerce and industry, it continued to be the
                    chief centre of the culture, the intellectual activity, and the social refinement of Southern
                    Indiana. I have before me as I write a long list, which I forbear to copy, of men who made Madison
                    or its near neighborhood their home at that time, and who were conspicuously distinguished in State
                    and nation for their abilities, their culture and their intellectual achievements.</p>
                <p>Add to all these things the fact that the little city is surrounded by scenery of rare beauty and
                    interest, and that it lies in a region richer, I think, than any other in all <pb id="VAA2342-139"
                        n="136"/> that part of the country, in geological formations of a kind likely to awaken the
                    interest und enthusiasm of an eager boy, and the reader will understand how great a part his new
                    surroundings played in the development of Edward Eggleston&apos;s mind and character.</p>
                <p>Another advantage which our removal to Madison brought to Edward was a closer contact than he had
                    ever before enjoyed with a man whose high character and richly dowered intellect made association
                    with him a circumstance of the utmost consequence to such a boy as Edward was.</p>
                <p>For what has need to be said concerning that gifted man and his influence, another chapter must be
                    opened. Meanwhile I complete this one by saying that the only school Edward attended during our stay
                    in Madison, was one in which education was conducted upon the old and very brutal &quot;knock
                    down and drag out&quot; system.</p>
                <p>There were two boys&apos; schools of that kind in the town, each presided over by a <pb
                        id="VAA2342-140" n="137"/> man of adequate scholarship, but of almost demoniacal ferocity in
                    discipline. As there was no other school in the town sufficiently advanced in its curriculum, Edward
                    and I were sent to one of these.</p>
                <p>Neither of us was ever made the victim of the brutality which dominated the school. I rejoice in that
                    fact now, because I firmly intended then, and I am sure I should have carried out my purpose, to
                    kill the teacher if he should ever horsewhip either Edward or myself in the bloodthirsty way in
                    which he daily flogged other boys. It is a comfort to me that I escaped the deliberately anticipated
                    necessity of committing homicide.</p>
                <p>After the usual month or two of attendance upon this school, Edward fell ill again made so, as he
                    assured me in later years, chiefly by the nervous distress he suffered from the daily and hourly
                    sight of the brutalities inflicted upon his schoolmates.</p>
                <p>Long years afterwardafter he had made his own name famousEdward visited <pb id="VAA2342-141" n="138"
                    /> Madison, and while there declined the most important reception tendered to him, solely because he
                    had learned that the teacher of that school &quot;the keeper of that shambles&quot; Edward
                    called him, was still living and was to be one of the guests upon the occasion.</p>
                <p>&quot;I simply couldn&apos;t face that man, Geordie,&quot; he said to me when telling me
                    of the matter. &quot;The very thought of him filled me with the old-time terror.&quot;</p>
                <p>Fortunately there presently came to Madison a system of graded schools, which at once made an end of
                    the two &quot;English and classical academies&quot; that had so long survived as evil relics
                    of the savage age in pedagogy.</p>
                <p>The graded school system was fortunately organized and presided over by an educator of rare wisdom
                    and humane mind, a Mr. Barnes. I know not whether he still lives or not, but to him, or to his
                    memory as the case may be, I rejoice to pay a tribute of deserved gratitude.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-142" n="139"/>
                <p>Edward did not at any time attend the graded schools in Madison. His health did not permit that, but
                    after his customary fashion he diligently prosecuted his studies on his own account and made more
                    rapid progress than he would have made had he been one of a class in school.</p>

                    influence upon Edward Eggleston&apos;s mind and character at this period of his boyhood, was
                    Guilford Dudley Eggleston.</p>
                <p>I have never known a man who more perfectly satisfied the highest ideals I can form of manhood in its
                    perfection than this somewhat distant kinsman of ours did. He was the son of our father&apos;s
                    first cousin, Judge Myles Cary Eggleston, who was in his time one of the most learned and most
                    distinguished jurists in all the region west of the Alleghenies. Our cousin Guilford had been
                    educated in the best schools and colleges of his time, and, being a man of sufficient means, he had
                    employed his abun <pb id="VAA2342-144" n="141"/> dant leisure in adding to his scholarship all that
                    wisely directed reading, conscientiously liberal thinking, and more of travel and contact with
                    intellectual men than was common at that time, could bring to a man of superior intellectual and
                    moral character.</p>
                <p>Better still, he was a man of unusual spiritual qualities that fascinated all with whom he came in
                    contact and made him one of the best beloved of men. Sunny in temper, inimitably kindly and
                    affectionate, abounding in healthful animal spirits, full of a humor that seemed to caress while it
                    amused, he was an optimist who brought about the good that he so confidently hoped for.</p>
                <p>From our earliest childhood this kinsman of ours had been Edward&apos;s ideal man and mine. His
                    comings to our home were to us the gladdest of all happenings. From the moment of his coming to the
                    hour of his departure we were in an ecstatic state of limitless joy. He made himself our com <pb
                        id="VAA2342-145" n="142"/> panion, our ceaseless entertainer, and, without our knowing the fact,
                    our wisest teacher.</p>
                <p>Our return to Madison brought Edward directly and constantly under this man&apos;s influence and
                    guidance. Edward was only about fourteen years old at the time, but his intellectual activity was
                    already remarkable. Apart from his studies, he was reading voraciously in departments of literature
                    and history which usually offer no attraction to boys of that age. When Col. Michael C. Garber,
                    editor of the Madison <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>, offered a prize for the best essay that might be
                    submitted to him for publication, Edward easily secured the award and immediately set himself down
                    to read and love the poems of William Cullen Bryant, a good edition of which constituted the prize
                    he had won.</p>
                <p>He had already become enamored of Longfellow, but Pope had been, until that time, his favorite poet,
                    perhaps because, in the &quot;Essay on Man,&quot; the little poem on Solitude and some
                    others, Pope strongly ap <pb id="VAA2342-146" n="143"/> pealed to the philosophical side of the
                    meditative boy&apos;s nature.</p>
                <p>He was fond of reading Burke, too, and Addison and Steele. He even read the elder Mill and Bentham,
                    and much else of like character.</p>
                <p>But his reading was self-directed, and not always wisely so. His habit of believing &quot;that
                    which is written&quot; sometimes misled him through the influence of unsound writers and
                    untrustworthy thinkers.</p>
                <p>Our kinsman interested himself to correct this, and to guide both the studies and the intellectual
                    exercises of the boy into profitable channels. He chose Edward&apos;s books for him, lending
                    many from his own well-equipped library, some of them books to which otherwise the boy would not
                    have had access.</p>
                <p>Better still, this wise and most gentle mentor taught Edward how to think. He was at pains to correct
                    the habit of too ready acceptance, to awaken in his pupil that <pb id="VAA2342-147" n="144"/>
                    intellectual independence without which reading is apt to be worse than profitless. He taught the
                    boy to doubt, to question, to compare, to investigate, and to reason. He &quot;breathed into his
                    nostrils the breath of life.&quot;</p>
                <p>And while thus educating the boy&apos;s mind, he was at equal pains to train his character. He
                    laughed him out of a certain unwholesome asceticism which the ignorant dogmatism of a narrow
                    religious teaching had bred in him. In a word, the wholesome influence of this man did more than all
                    else at that time to bring moral and intellectual health to the boy, to enliven his life and
                    strengthen all that was best in his nature, while repressing and correcting every tendency to
                    morbidity of mind or spirit.</p>
                <p>Speaking of this period of his boyhood in later life, Edward once said:</p>
                <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t suspect that Guilford was trying to teach me or even to influence me. I
                    never found that out until after I became a <pb id="VAA2342-148" n="145"/> man of middle age. At the
                    time I thought he was merely trying, in his genial fashion, to make himself entertaining.</p>
                <p>Edward was destined soon to be separated for a time from this close companionship with a mind and
                    character so rare, but the separation brought him under another influence of like kind which was not
                    less profitable to him.</p>
                <p>After two years in Madison Mr. Terrell accepted an appointment under the American Bible Society,_
                    which required him to travel almost continually. Presently, therefore, the family was removed again
                    to the old home in Vevay, and there Edward and I attended the newly established High School,
                    presided over by Mrs. Julia L. Dumont, the wisest woman and the most successful teacher I have ever
                    known. Elsewhere in this volume I have called her a Dr. Arnold in petticoats, but she was more even
                    than that. Her gift of mastery over young minds was an inspiration, her sympathy with youthful <pb
                        id="VAA2342-149" n="146"/> thought and feeling was a sixth sense. Indeed her gift and her
                    practice of encouraging pupils, was looked upon by many parents at that time as dangerous in
                    tendency. To those who had been trained in the severities of an older and ruder time, praise for a
                    pupil seemed a perilous throwing down of the bars of discipline. It was feared also that
                    commendation might breed vanity and selfconceit of a kind to endanger the salvation of souls.</p>
                <p>The graded school system was less successful in Vevay than had been hoped, and Mrs. Dumontwho taught
                    solely because she loved the work and not at all because she needed to do so,opened a little school
                    of her own, sharply limiting it to ten boys &quot;<hi rend="i">My</hi> ten boys&quot; she
                    called us.</p>
                <p>How she conducted school, what methods she employed and what results she attained, Edward has himself
                    related in print, in a fashion which I cannot hope to improve upon by any writing of my own.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-150" n="147"/>
                <p>His account of this gifted teacher was part of an article published in <hi rend="i"
                        >Scribncr&apos;s Monthly</hi>, now <hi rend="i">The Century Magazine</hi>, for March, 1879.
                    I am indebted to the courtesy of the Century Company, and of Dr. Richard Watson Gilder, the editor
                    of the magazine, for a generous permission to copy here so much of the article as I wish. I copy all
                    that part of it which relates to Mrs. Dumont.</p>
                <p>&quot;We had one teacher who was, so far as natural genius for teaching goes, the best of all I
                    have ever known. Mrs. Julia L. Dumont is, like all our Western writers of that day, except Prentice,
                    almost entirely forgotten. But in the time before railways, when the West, shut in by the
                    Alleghenies, had an incipient literature, Mrs. Dumont occupied no mean place as a writer of poetry
                    and prose tales. Eminent <hi rend="i">litterateurs</hi> of the time, from Philadelphia and
                    Cincinnati, used to come to Vevay to see her; but they themselvesthese great lights of ancient Ameri
                        <pb id="VAA2342-151" n="148"/> can literature away back in the fortiesare also forgotten. Who
                    remembers Gallagher and the rest today? Dear brethren, who, like myself, scratch away to fill up
                    magazine pages, and who, no doubt, like myself, are famous enough to be asked for an autograph or a
                    &apos;sentiment&apos; in an album sometimes, let us not boast ourselves. Why, indeed, should
                    the spirit of mortal be proud? We also shall be forgottenthe next generation of school girls will
                    get their autographs from a set of upstarts, who will smile at our stories and poems as out of date
                    puerilities. Some industrious Allibone, making a cemetery of dead authors, may give us in his
                    dictionary three lines apiece as a sort of headstone. Oh, Jet us be humble, and pray that even the
                    Allibone that is to come do not forget us. For I look in vain in Allibone for some of the favorite
                    names in our Western Parnassus. It was not enough that the East swallowed that incipient literature,
                    it even obliterated the memory of it.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-152" n="149"/>
                <p>&quot;Among those who have been so swiftly forgotten as not even to have a place in Allibone, is
                    my old and once locally famous teacher, Mrs. Dumont. We thought her poem on &apos;The Retreat of
                    the Ten Thousand &apos;admirable, but we were partial judges. Her story of
                    &apos;Boonesborough&apos; was highly praised by the great lights of the time. But her book
                    of stories is out of print, and her poems are forgotten, and so are the great lights who admired
                    them. I do not pretend that there was enough in these writings to have made them deserve a different
                    fate. Ninety-nine-hundredths of all good literary production must of necessity be forgotten; if the
                    old trees endured forever there would be no room for the new shoots.</p>
                <p>&quot;But as a schoolmistress Mrs. Dumont deserves immortality. She knew nothing of systems, but
                    she went unerringly to the goal by pure force of native genius. In all her early life she taught
                    because she was poor, but after her husband&apos;s increasing property <pb id="VAA2342-153"
                        n="150"/> relieved her from necessity, she still taught school from love of it. When she was
                    past sixty years old, a school-room was built for her alongside her residence, which was one of the
                    best in the town. It was here that I first knew her, after she had already taught two generations in
                    the place. The &apos;graded&apos; schools had been newly introduced, and no man was found
                    who could, either in acquirements or ability, take precedence of the venerable schoolmistress; so
                    the High School was given to her.</p>
                <p>&quot;I can see the wonderful old lady now, as she was then, with her cape pinned awry, rocking
                    her splint-bottom chair nervously while she talked. Full of all manner of knowledge, gifted with
                    something very like eloquence in speech, abounding in affection for her pupils and enthusiasm in
                    teaching, she moved us strangely. Being infatuated with her, we became fanatic in our pursuit of
                    knowledge, so that the school hours were not enough, and we had a &apos;lyceum&apos; in the
                        <pb id="VAA2342-154" n="151"/> evening for reading compositions and a club for the study of
                    history. If a recitation became very interesting, the entire school would sometimes be drawn into
                    the discussion of the subject; all other lessons went to the wall, books of reference were brought
                    out of her library, hours were consumed, and many a time the school session was prolonged until
                    darkness forced us reluctantly to adjourn.</p>
                <p>&quot;Mrs. Dumont was the ideal of a teacher because she succeeded in forming character. She gave
                    her pupils unstinted praise, not hypocritically, but because she lovingly saw the best in every one.
                    We worked in the sunshine. A dull but industrious pupil was praised for diligence, a bright pupil
                    for ability, a good one for general excellence. The dullards got more than their share, for, knowing
                    how easily such an one is disheartened, Mrs. Dumont went out of her way to praise the first show of
                    success in a slow scholar. She treated no two alike. She was full of all <pb id="VAA2342-155"
                        n="152"/> sorts of knack and tact, a person of infinite resource for calling out the human
                    spirit. She could be incredibly severe when it was needful, and no overgrown boy whose meanness had
                    once been analyzed by Mrs. Dumont ever forgot it.</p>
                <p>&quot;I remember one boy with whom she had taken some pains. One day he wrote an insulting word
                    about one of the girls of the school on the door of a deserted house. Two of us were deputized by
                    the other boys to defend the girl by complaining of him. Mrs. Dumont took her seat and began to talk
                    to him before the school. The talking was all there was of it, but I think I never pitied any human
                    being more than I did that boy as she showed him his vulgarity and his meanness, and as, at last, in
                    the climax of her indignation, she called him &apos;a miserable hawbuck.&apos; At another
                    time, when she had picked a piece of paper from the floor with a bit of profanity written on it, she
                    talked about it until the whole school detected the <pb id="VAA2342-156" n="153"/> author by the
                    beads of perspiration on his forehead.</p>
                <p>&quot;When I had written a composition on &apos;The Human Mind,&apos; based on
                    Combe&apos;s &apos;Phrenology,&apos; and adorned with quotations from Pope&apos;s
                    &apos; Essay on Man,&apos; she gave me to read an old &apos; Encyclopedia
                    Britannica,&apos; containing an article expounding the Hartleian system of mental philosophy,
                    and followed this with Locke on the &apos;Conduct of the Understanding.&apos; She was the
                    only teacher I have known who understood that school studies were entirely secondary to general
                    reading as a source of culture, and who put the habit of good reading first in the list of
                    acquirements.</p>
                <p>&quot;There was a rack for hats and cloaks so arranged as to cut off a portion of the school from
                    the teacher&apos;s sight. Some of the larger girls who occupied this space took advantage of
                    their concealed position to do a great deal of talking and tittering, which did not escape Mrs.
                    Dumont&apos;s watchfulness.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-157" n="154"/>
                <p>But in the extreme corner of the room was the seat of Drusilla H, who had never violated a rule of
                    the school. To reprimand the others while excepting her would have excited jealousy and complaints.
                    The girls who sat in that part of the room were detained after school and treated to one of Mrs.
                    Dumont&apos;s tender but caustic lectures on the dishonorableness of secret ill-doing. Drusilla
                    bore silently her share of the reproof. But at the last the schoolmistress said:</p>
                <p>&quot;&apos;Now, my dears, it may be that there is some one among you not guilty of
                    misconduct. If there is, I know I can trust you to tell me who is not to blame.&apos;</p>
                <p>&quot;&apos;Drusilla never talks,&apos; they all said at once, while Drusilla, girl like,
                    fell to crying.</p>
                <p>&quot;But the most remarkable illustration of Mrs. Dumont&apos;s skill in matters of
                    discipline was shown in a case in which all the boys of the school were involved, and were for a
                    short time thrown into antagonism to <pb id="VAA2342-158" n="155"/> a teacher whose ascendency over
                    them had been complete.</p>
                <p>&quot;We were playing &apos;townball &apos; on the common, at a long distance from the
                    schoolroom. Townball is one of the old games from which the more scientific but not half so amusing
                    &apos;national game&apos; of baseball has since been evolved. In that day the national game
                    was not thought of. Eastern youth played field-base, and Western boys townball, in a free and happy
                    way, with soft balls, primitive bats, and no nonsense. There were no scores, but a catch or a
                    cross-out in townball put the whole side out, leaving the others to take the bat or
                    &apos;paddle,&apos; as it was appropriately called. The very looseness of the game gave
                    opportunity for many ludicrous mischances and surprising turns, which made it a most joyous play.</p>
                <p>&quot;Either because the wind was blowing adversely, or because the play was more than commonly
                    interesting, we failed to hear the ringing of Mrs. Dumont&apos;s bell at one o&apos;clock.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-159" n="156"/>
                <p>The afternoon wore on until more than an hour of school time had passed, when some one suddenly
                    bethought himself. We dropped the game and started, pell-mell, full of consternation, for the
                    school-room. We would at that moment have preferred to face an angry schoolmaster, with his beechen
                    rod, than to have offended one whom we reverenced so much. The girls all sat in their places; the
                    teacher was sitting, silent and awful, in her rocking-chair; in the hour and a half no lessons had
                    been recited. We shuffled into our seats and awaited the storm. It was the High School, and the boys
                    were mostly fifteen or sixteen years of age, but the schoolmistress had never a rod in the room.
                    Such weapons are for people of fewer resources than she. Very quietly she talked to us, but with
                    great emphasis. She gave no chance for explanation or apology. She was hopelessly hurt and offended.
                    We had humiliated her before the whole town, she said. She should take away from us the <pb
                        id="VAA2342-160" n="157"/> morning and afternoon recess for a week. She would demand an
                    explanation from us to-morrow.</p>
                <p>&quot;It was not possible that a company of boys could be kept for half an hour in such a moral
                    sweat-box as that to which she treated us without growing angry. When school was dismissed we held a
                    running indignation meeting, as we walked toward home. Of course, we all spoke at once. But after
                    awhile the more moderate saw that the teacher had some reason. Nevertheless, one boy<ref
                        id="ref_001" rend="super" target="note_001" targOrder="U">*</ref> was appointed to draft a
                    written reply that should set forth our injured feelings. I remember in what perplexity that
                    committee found himself. With every hour he felt more and more that the teacher was right and the
                    boys wrong, and that by the next morning the reviving affection of the scholars for the beloved and
                    venerated schoolmistress would <pb id="VAA2342-161" n="158"/> cause them to appreciate this. So that
                    the address which was presented for their signatures did not breathe much indignation. I can almost
                    recall every word of that somewhat pompous but very sincere petition. It was about as I give it
                    here:

                    <p>The &quot;one boy&quot; thus commissioned was Edward Eggleston, through his modesty
                        forbade him to say so. He was recognized as morally and intellectually the superior of all of
                        usthe captain of the school in all matters involving brains or character. A<hi rend="sc"

                <p>The boys all willingly signed this except one, who was perhaps the only conscious offender in the
                    party. He confessed that he had observed that the sun was &apos;geting a little
                    slanting&apos; white we were at play, but as his side &apos;had the paddles,&apos; he
                    did not say anything until they were put out. The unwilling boy wanted more indignation in the
                    address, and he wanted the recess back. But when all the others had signed he did not dare leave his
                    name off, but put it at the bottom of the list.</p>

                <p>&quot;With trembling hands we gave the paper to the schoolmistress. How some teachers would have
                    used such a paper as a means of further humiliation to the offenders! How few could have used it as
                    she did! The morning wore on without recess. The lessons were heard as usual. As the noon hour drew
                    near Mrs. Dumont rose from her chair and went into the library. We all felt that something was going
                    to happen. She came out with a copy of Shakespeare, which she opened at the fourth scene of the
                    fourth act of the second part of King Henry IV. Giving the book to my next neighbor and myself, she
                    bade us read the scene, alternating with the change of speaker. You remember the famous dialogue in
                    that scene between the dying king and the prince who has prematurely taken the crown from the
                    bedside of the sleeping king. It was all wonderfully fresh to us and to our schoolmates, whose
                    interest was divided between the scene and a curiosity as to the use the <pb id="VAA2342-164"
                        n="160"/> teacher meant to make of it. At length the reader who took the king&apos;s part
                    read:</p>
                <lg>
                    <l n="1">&apos; O my son!</l>
                    <l n="2">Heaven put it in thy mind to take it hence,</l>
                    <l n="3">That thou mightst win the more thy father&apos;s love,</l>
                    <l n="4">Pleading so wisely in excuse of it.&apos;</l>
                </lg>
                <p>&quot;Then she took the book and closed it. The application was evident to all, but she made us a
                    touching little speech, full of affection, and afterward restored the recess. She detained the girls
                    after we had gone, to read to them the address, that she might &apos;show them what noble
                    brothers they had.&apos; Without doubt she made overmuch of our nobleness. But no one knew
                    better than Mrs. Dumont that the surest way of evoking the best in man or boy is to make the most of
                    the earliest symptoms of it. From that hour our schoolmistress had our whole hearts; we loved her
                    and reverenced her; we were thoughtless enough, but for the most of us her half-suspected wish was a
                    supreme law.</p>
                <p>&quot;So, after all, it does not matter that the <pb id="VAA2342-165" n="161"/> world no longer
                    reads her stories or remembers her poems. Her life always seemed to me a poem, or something better
                    than a poem.&quot;</p>
                <p>At the risk of seeming intrusive, I venture to add to Edward&apos;s reminiscences of Mrs. Dumont,
                    one of my own. I do so because the incident I have to relate additionally illustrates Mrs.
                    Dumont&apos;s peculiar gift of seeing, in each case, to what motive the strongest appeal could
                    be made.</p>
                <p>Until I came under her instruction, I had not been able to learn to write. All my previous teachers
                    had failed to teach me even the rudiments of that art. One after another of them had abandoned the
                    effort in disgust, convinced that there was a natural inaptitude on my part which no effort could
                    overcome. In addition to the instruction given me in ordinary schools, I had been placed
                    successively under the tuition of several peripatetic writing masters who had come our way, but all
                    to no purpose. Do <pb id="VAA2342-166" n="162"/> what they would I could not learn to write. I could
                    not myself read my own manuscript after it had &quot;grown cold.&quot; The pen, as my
                    teachers made me hold it, was as unwieldy in my grasp as a cord-wood stick or a fence rail. I could
                    do nothing with it.</p>
                <p>My latest writing master was still in town, achieving distinction by teaching all the young people,
                    and some of their elders, to make &quot;hair lines &quot;for their up strokes and heavily
                    shaded ones for down strokes, and to decorate their paper with elaborately meaningless
                    &quot;flourishes.&quot; He had made a positively desperate attempt to teach me to write. He
                    had tied up my fingers with blue ribbons to compel me to hold my pen correctly. He had written the
                    word &quot;miserable&quot; across each page of my copy-bookemphasizing his criticism by even
                    more elaborate flourishes than usual. He had called me &quot;dunce,&quot;
                    &quot;booby&quot; and other pet names of like sort, and finally he had dismissed me from his
                    school, sending my mother a letter, <pb id="VAA2342-167" n="163"/> in which he assured her that it
                    was useless to make any further effort to teach me an art which I was wholly incapable of learning.</p>
                <p>I suppose that Mrs. Dumont had been informed of all this. At any rate, when I asked her to excuse me
                    from all writing exercises, she assumed a look of admiring astonishment and asked:</p>
                <p>&quot;Why, has Mr. Wilson (the writing master) taught you to write so well that you can learn no
                    more? He must be a wonderful teacher!&quot;</p>
                <p>Only the pride and resolution of a sturdy boy kept back the tears as I answered, in deep humiliation:</p>
                <p>&quot;No, Mrs. Dumont, I can never learn to write.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Who says that?&quot; she asked, quietly.</p>
                <p>&quot;Mr. Wilson andand every teacher I ever had.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Let me look at your hand, George,&quot; she gently said, and I held it out for
                    inspection. She seemed to study it closely, manip <pb id="VAA2342-168" n="164"/> ulating the fingers
                    one after another. Then she said:</p>
                <p>&quot;I hear that you are the best marble player in town. Is that so?&quot;</p>
                <p>My pockets at that moment were bulging with a multitude of marbles which I had recently won, and I
                    pleaded guilty to a degree of skill in that sport which made it risky for any boy to try conclusions
                    with me in a game of &quot;keeps.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;And yet Mr. Wilson says you cannot learn to write? Perhaps he called you a
                    &apos;booby,&apos; too?&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered,&quot; and a &apos;dunce.&apos;&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Perhaps he tied up your fingers in blue ribbons to make you hold the pen in his
                    way?&quot;</p>
                <p>I was well nigh appalled by this exhibition of mind reading, but I managed to answer that he had done
                    precisely as she had said.</p>
                <p>&quot;Well, now, George,&quot; she said, in her peculiarly caressing voice, &quot;you and
                    I are <pb id="VAA2342-169" n="165"/> going to find out who is the &apos;booby&apos; in this
                    caseyou, who can learn anything you please, or a writing master who doesn&apos;t know that a boy
                    who can play marbles can be taught to write. Now, I&apos;ll tell you what you and I are going to
                    do. I am going to teach you to write a clear, legible and sensible hand; and two weeks from
                    to-daydon&apos;t forget to remind me of the datetwo weeks from today you are going to write a
                    letter to Mr. Wilson. I will dictate it, and you shall write it and sign it. When he gets it he too
                    will know who the &apos;booby&apos; is.&quot;</p>
                <p>That wise woman&apos;s battle was won. No teacher had ever talked to me in any such way as that.
                    None had ever so aroused my ambition. In that hour I made up my mind that I would learn to write,
                    and to write well, if I had to give all my nights and days to the task. Mrs. Dumont believed in me;
                    her faith should not be disappointed. She had only to tell me what to do and how, and I would do it,
                    even if it involved physical torture.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-170" n="166"/>
                <p>And how wisely she set to work to teach me! First of all she told me that all
                    &quot;flourishing&quot; in writing was a silly thing, not only useless but positively
                    harmful, in that it interfered with legibility. Secondly, she ridiculed the idea, beloved of writing
                    masters, that the up strokes should be &quot;hair lines,&quot; and the down strokes heavily
                    shaded.</p>
                <p>&quot;Why is not one part of a letter as important as any other part?&quot; she asked. Then
                    she explained to me that the object one has in view in writing is to set down the words in such a
                    way that other people may read what you have written; that absolute legibility is the first and
                    chief virtue of a handwriting, and that the only other thing to be sought after is facilitythe
                    ability to write rapidly and easily.</p>
                <p>This instruction gave me a totally new conception of the art I was set to learn, and a very helpful
                    conception it was, particularly after I observed how beautiful my teacher&apos;s handwriting was
                    in its absolute simplicity.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-171" n="167"/>
                <p>&quot;Now, to begin with,&quot; she said, when I took my first writing lesson at her hands,
                    &quot;you are to hold the pen in the way that seems most natural to youthe way which best
                    enables you to make the marks you intend.&quot;</p>
                <p>I welcomed this permission and grasped my pen in a peculiarly awkward way.</p>
                <p>&quot;You do hold a pen rather queerly,&quot; she said. &quot;But never mind that now.
                    We&apos;ll correct that little by little as we go on. At present you are going to learn to write
                    legibly, giving no heed to anything else.&quot;</p>
                <p>To my utter astonishment I could read the lines I wrote for my first lesson. Within three or four
                    days my handwriting began to look like Mrs. Dumont&apos;s own, and by the end of the appointed
                    two weeks this resemblance had become so close that the two were distinguishable only by the greater
                    certainty and precision of form that marked hers.</p>
                <p>Then came the letter to Mr. Wilson. <pb id="VAA2342-172" n="168"/> It ran somewhat as followsfor I
                    think I remember almost verbatim a missive which it gave me boundless joy to write at my
                    teacher&apos;s dictation:</p>
                <p>&quot;Dear Sir:</p>
                <p>Mrs. Dumont. Mrs. Dumont thinks you should be pleased write a legible and sensible hand, and that I
                    am not quite so hopeless a booby as you thought me.&quot;</p>
                <p>I begged permission to insert the word &quot;intelligent&quot; before the word
                    &quot;instruction,&quot; but my teacher said me nay.</p>
                <p>&quot;He will be sufficiently taught by the letter as it stands,&quot; she explained.</p>

                <p>U<hi rend="sc">NDER</hi> the influences described in the last preceding chapter, Edward&apos;s
                    mind developed rapidly. His extensive reading of the best books, and, still more, his intimacy with
                    two such minds as Guilford Eggleston&apos;s and Mrs. Dumont&apos;s, could not fail to aid
                    and hasten the intellectual and moral development of a boy so gifted and so earnest as he.</p>
                <p>The results are easily enough understood, but they were somewhat paradoxical. Edward at one and the
                    same time grew much older and much younger than he had been. In his thinking he became more mature
                    than before; in his spirit he grew far more boyish than he had ever been.</p>
                <p>Under spur of the ascetic religious teaching he had received from the pulpit <pb id="VAA2342-174"
                        n="170"/> utterances of men whose oratorical exaggerations he took in their literal sense,
                    Edward had become positively morbid in his conscientiousness, during his early youth. As an
                    illustration, I remember that at one timewhen he had attained the ripe age of elevenhe suddenly
                    began a rigid suppression of conversational gifts which were extremely good in one so young. Often
                    he would remain silent for hours. When he talked at all he stripped his sentences of every word that
                    could be spared, and spoke only of serious and solemn things. His natural impulse to lightness in
                    conversation was repressed. His humor, which was always the delight of his companions, was kept
                    under a restraint as severe as if he had been a monk in a season of &quot;retreat.&quot;</p>
                <p>Against all this the thoughtless youngster who writes these lines out of a grayhaired memory
                    violently revolted. I wanted my brother back. I wanted to hear him talk. I wanted the smiles on my
                    own <pb id="VAA2342-175" n="171"/> face that his humor always engraved there. I wanted to be in
                    touch with his naturally genial and jovial spirit again. So I challenged him to tell me why he had
                    suddenly become so restrained in speech. For answer he opened the New Testament and showed me the
                    passive which reads:</p>
                <p>&quot;But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account
                    thereof in the day of judgment.&quot;</p>
                <p>After the fashion of that time he had taken that passage literally, as he took, and as the preachers
                    insisted upon taking every other passage of the Scriptures. And by &quot;idle words&quot; he
                    understood the text to mean all unnecessary words.</p>
                <p>In those days well-ordered young persons were carefully taught to say &quot;yes,
                    ma&apos;am&quot; and &quot;no, ma&apos;am,&quot; &quot;yes, sir&quot;
                    and &quot;no, sir&quot;; but Edward&apos;s spiritual eye was fixed upon &quot;the
                    day of judgment,&quot; and in fear of that he resolutely dropped the
                    &quot;ma&apos;am&quot; and &quot;sir,&quot; as &quot;idle words&quot;
                    for <pb id="VAA2342-176" n="172"/> which, if he spoke them, he must give an account at that dread
                    time.</p>
                <p>In brief, Edward was beset in his boyhood by that &quot;lust after perfection,&quot; of which
                    he afterwards pointed out the evil consequences in his novel of New York life, &quot;The
                    F&apos;aith Doctor,&quot; calling it &quot;the realest peril of great souls.&quot;</p>
                <p>Indeed, his condition of mind and soul for a time was the original from which in later, maturer, and
                    more enlightened years, he drew the portrait of Phillida, the devotee heroine of that novel.</p>
                <p>The influence of Guilford Eggleston and Mrs. Dumont corrected all this, and Edward learned of them a
                    wiser and a more wholesome philosophy of life than that which the half-baked theology of that time
                    had taught him. He learned of them a better gospel than that of asceticism. He grew healthier of
                    mind, and with that change came a greater bodily health. He was still lacking in physical
                    robustness, but he had <pb id="VAA2342-177" n="173"/> learned that it was his right to enjoy and to
                    exercise such physical capacities as were his. The first result of this was that his health did not
                    break down under school work as it had so often done before, though he was studying harder and
                    reading more than he had ever done. The tonic administered to his mind was potent also in
                    strengthening his body. Feeling now that he might indulge, without sin, those impulses of physical
                    activity which nature implants in all boys for their good, Edward entered upon our sports with a
                    spirit that quickly made him monarch of the playground. Others of us could outrun him. Some of us
                    could throw or bat or catch a ball with greater precision than he could. But we were a careless,
                    heedless crew, while he brought his conscience to bear upon our playground games as earnestly as he
                    had ever done in more important things. To him it seemed that, having accepted a place on one or the
                    other side of agame, he was in duty and <pb id="VAA2342-178" n="174"/> conscience bound to do his
                    very best for the success of his side. We would sometimes &quot;miss&quot; through
                    heedlessness or a lack of sufficient care in the performance of our parts; he never did. If he
                    missed at all it was because he could not avoid doing so by the most conscientious endeavor. If one
                    of us missed catching or batting a ball that our known skill made it possible to catch or bat, our
                    comrades jeered at us as &quot;butter fingers,&quot; or more seriously quarreled with us for
                    carelessness. But if Edward missed it was understood that the catch or bat stroke was beyond his
                    utmost power to achieve.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of this conscientiousness in play, he soon came to be the first boy selected
                    whenever we &quot;chose up&quot; for a game. We all knew that there were more skilful
                    players than he among us; but we also knew that we could trust his conscientiousness of endeavor to
                    give better results in the game than our superior but carelessly exercised skill could hope for.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-179" n="175"/>
                <p>His moral supremacy was even more marked. In that school-boy republic all were equal in their rights,
                    of course, and there was never the smallest hesitation on the part of any of us in the formation or
                    the expression of an opinion. We stoutly insisted upon freedom of speech and majority rule. But
                    Edward&apos;s speech, though no freer than that of any other, always carried greater weight,
                    and, if his opinion was pronounced, he constituted a majority in every case.</p>
                <p>&quot;Seems to me we ought to do so and so,&quot; one of the boys would say, &quot;but
                    Ed. Eggleston says not, and of course he knows best.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Of course he does,&quot; the rest of us would answer, and that settled the matter. It
                    was a case of MacGregor&apos;s seat being the head of the table.</p>
                <p>This supremacy of personal influence was not gained by self-assertion, for there was no boy in the
                    school less given than Edward was to assume the rights of a dictator. <pb id="VAA2342-180" n="176"/>
                    It was solely the result of our confidence in his superior judgment, and, still more important, his
                    absolute conscientiousness. With us the wish was often father to the thought; with him it never was.
                    With us desire might influence conviction; with him, we knew, personal preference played no part at
                    all. And so his judgments were always final and conclusive, however clamorously we might contend
                    against them in arguing the matter in hand before the decision was rendered.</p>
                <p>I remember that we were once engaged in a hot discussion of this kind when Mr. Dumont, the husband of
                    our teacher, and a lawyer of great distinction, drove up in his buggy. He stopped the horse and held
                    up his hand for silence, and the silence instantly came.</p>
                <p>&quot;Boys,&quot; he said, &quot;I have a suggestion to make to you. In the days of my
                    young manhood I used to attend town meetings. The people were disposed to squabble some <pb
                        id="VAA2342-181" n="177"/> times, just as you boys were doing a moment ago. To prevent that the
                    town meeting always chose one man to be &apos; moderator,&apos; and gave him authority to
                    keep order and decide debates. You boys ought to have a &apos;moderator.&apos;&quot;</p>
                <p>Instantly one of the boys called out:</p>
                <p>&quot;Oh, we don&apos;t need a moderator, Mr. Dumont. We jabber and chatter as much as we
                    please, but we know all the time that when Ed. Eggleston gets ready he&apos;ll decide the
                    question, and that&apos;ll end it.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward was meanwhile using his influence in behalf of our culture in other ways. He organized a
                    debating society to meet in that little red brick building in our grounds which had formerly been
                    our father&apos;s law office, and which now served Edward and me as bedroom, study room and
                    general headquarters.</p>
                <p>Of this association he was promptly made chairman, and although he was not yet sixteen years old, he
                    set to work to make of <pb id="VAA2342-182" n="178"/> the club something more than an ordinary
                    debating society. It was he that dictated our choice of subjects for debate, and having chosen them,
                    he pointed out to each of the debaters the books that ought to be read in preparation for an
                    intelligent discussion of the subject in hand. Many of these books were drawn from our
                    mother&apos;s libraryby all odds the richest in Vevay in the list of its standard books with the
                    single exception of Mrs. Dumont&apos;s collection, which was held always open to our freest use.
                    But Edward borrowed for our reading everything else that could be had, and which could, by any
                    possibility, help to enlighten our minds The Presbyterian minister had a hundred books or so which
                    he freely placed at our disposal, and, upon learning what we were doing, Guilford Eggleston wrote to
                    Edward, commanding him to write each week, stating the contemplated subjects of debate, in order
                    that he might select and send to Vevay all the books in his own library that might <pb
                        id="VAA2342-183" n="179"/> in any wise bear upon the subject under discussion.</p>
                <p>This wise and most generous mentor went even further than that. Crippled as he was at the time, by
                    reason of an accident involving his ankle, he made a special journey to Vevay in order that he might
                    talk to our debating club and show us how to make the most profitable use of our time in reading.
                    Full of wisdom and discretion as he was, he was equally full of good spirits, and a matchless
                    sympathy with boyish ambitions for self improvement. He talked to us, not from a superior height,
                    but upon a level, and perhaps no service that Edward ever did to his comrades was so greatly good as
                    bringing Guilford Eggleston to talk to us.</p>
                <p>In these endeavors to carry his comrades along with him in his apprenticeship to culture, Edward was
                    mindful of the weaker ones in a specially tender fashion. There was one boy in the town who did not
                    belong to the school, because he was not sufficiently <pb id="VAA2342-184" n="180"/> educated to
                    enter it. He was the son of an Irish laborer, but he had inherited none of his father&apos;s wit
                    or shrewdness. His sisters had successfully passed through Mr. Wasson&apos;s school, and stood
                    well as young women of education and refinement; but poor John had a certain intellectual deficiency
                    which sadly stood in his way. We boys did not think of him even as a possible member of our coterie.
                    But one day he met Edward and said to him:</p>
                <p>&quot;I love verses. Have you got any verses in your club?&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward answered that we had not as yet taken up poetry, but that he would act upon the suggestion at
                    once and introduce some exercises that should involve verse. Then he summoned the rest of us and
                    proposed that we should elect John a member of our circle. We instantly and almost clamorously
                    objected. That boy was not of our kindnot in our class, we argued.</p>
                <p>&quot;That is precisely the reason why we <pb id="VAA2342-185" n="181"/> should take him into our
                    society,&quot; Edward rejoined. &quot;He needs our association as no one of us boys needs
                    it.&quot;</p>
                <p>So, under the orders of our master mind we took John into our society, and Edward so rearranged our
                    programs as to include in each of them the recitation or the reading of a certain proportion of
                    inspiring verse.</p>
                <p>I saw John three years ago and talked with him. He is an elderly man now, and, while still a rather
                    uneducated person, he is a good citizen, a good husband and a good father. He said to me:</p>
                <p>&quot;It was mighty good of you boys to take me in, and that was the turning point with me.
                    Somehow, after you let me into the club, I felt that I mustn&apos;t go wrong, and I
                    didn&apos;t. I remembered the verses Edward used to say, about</p>
                <lg>
                    <l n="1">&apos;So live, that when thy summons comes to join</l>
                    <l n="2">The innumerable caravan which moves</l>
                    <l n="3">To that mysterious realm where each shall take</l>
                    <l n="4">His chamber in the silent halls of death,</l>
                    <pb id="VAA2342-186" n="182"/>
                    <l n="5">Thou go not like the quarry slave at night,</l>
                    <l n="6">Scourged to his dungeon, but sustsined and soothed</l>
                    <l n="7">By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave</l>
                    <l n="8">Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch</l>
                    <l n="9">About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.&apos;</l>
                </lg>
                <p>&quot;You boys made a man of me when you let me join that club. I&apos;m not much of a job
                    for such fellows to turn out, but anyhow you made me the man I am, and God only knows what I should
                    have become if you hadn&apos;t let me in.&quot;</p>
                <p>Here surely was one of Edward Eggleston&apos;s sheaves, of a kind which no man need be ashamed to
                    offer to the Supreme Master of the Universe in proof of his harvest&apos;s worthiness.</p>
                <p>One of the results of Edward&apos;s larger enlightenment at this time was that I suffered at his
                    hands the only thrashing I ever got from any boy. I was accustomed to fight my way through all
                    difficulties, as the manner of Hoosier boys was. I can remember only a very few of my schoolmates
                    with whom I did not, at one time or other, settle <pb id="VAA2342-187" n="183"/> a controversy by a
                    bout with bare knuckles; but as I was unusually strong, uncommonly nimble, and much given to ready
                    aggressiveness in conflict, it had never happened to me to get so much the worst of any battle as to
                    be compelled to cry &quot;&apos;nough&quot;the accepted form of surrender at that time.</p>
                <p>In his earlier boyhood, Edward had adopted the non-combatant teaching of the Sermon on the Mount, and
                    had resolutely abided by it, with the result that I had been obliged to thrash several fellows
                    bigger than myself by way of avenging assaults made upon him, which he would not himself resist. But
                    under his new instruction Edward so far abandoned the practice of non-resistance as to give me, on
                    one occasion, the one good, sound thrashing that I so greatly needed for the chastening of my
                    spirit.</p>
                <p>The way of it was this. Edward and I, with a school-fellow, Will Campbell, remained on the ice one
                    day, after the game of shinny was done, and after all the other boys had <pb id="VAA2342-188"
                        n="184"/> gone home. For some reason which I cannot recall, I was in a querulous, cantankerous
                    mood, and strongly disposed to pick a quarrel with Will Campbell. Will was the gentlest-natured boy
                    in the town. I think he could have whipped me easily in a stand-up fight, as he was a year or so my
                    senior and very athletic, but he was by nature averse to quarreling. So on this occasion he accepted
                    my taunts meeklyso meekly that I wanted to whip him for not whipping me. At last I threatened to
                    strike him with my shinny stick. Thereupon Edward fiercely turned upon me and said:</p>
                <p>&quot;George, if you strike Will I&apos;ll thrash you.&quot;</p>
                <p>Now I perfectly well knew that he meant what he said. I also perfectly well knew that if I chose to
                    resist, I was greatly more than a match for my half-invalid brother, and could easily and quickly
                    dispose of any effort he might make to overcome my superior strength and agility. But I knew also
                    that <pb id="VAA2342-189" n="[]"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2342-7">

                    </figure>
                    <pb id="VAA2342-190" n="185"/> should Edward attack me, I would offer no manner of resistance. I
                    could no more think of striking him than of striking my mother.</p>
                <p>Still his words constituted what we boys called a &quot;dare,&quot; and it was an accepted
                    saying among us that &quot;anybody who will take a dare will steal a sheep.&quot;</p>
                <p>I did not really want or intend to strike Will Campbell with my shinny stick; but in saying what he
                    did, Edward had in effect &quot;dared&quot; me to give the blow, and by all the principles
                    of school-boy ethics I was bound to meet the &quot;dare&quot; halfway. So I struck Will, not
                    violently, and not even in a fashion that could inflict the least pain, but with just sufficient
                    force to make the blow good as an acceptance of the challenge.</p>
                <p>Instantly Edward skated to the shore and deliberately began taking off his skates. Mine were already
                    off, and as I was much fleeter of foot than he, I might easily have run away. But had I done that, I
                    should <pb id="VAA2342-191" n="186"/> have incurred intolerable disgrace in the eyes of all the boys
                    in town. So I stood my ground, and presently Edward, in righteous wrath, assailed me. As I made no
                    resistance, he soon had me on my back, while he sat astride my chest, vigorously boxing my ears and
                    calling to me to say &quot;&apos;nough.&quot; That I refused to do, and to this day I am
                    unable to guess how the affair would have ended, if Will Campbell had not generously come to my
                    assistance, dragging Edward away.</p>
                <p>But while I had resolutely refused to the very end to cry &quot;&apos;nough,&quot; I was
                    sufficiently conquered to answer all the moral purposes that my brother had had in view. Recognizing
                    the generosity of Will Campbell&apos;s act in coming to my assistance, I held out my hand to the
                    boy and said: &quot;I hope I didn&apos;t hurt you, Will! I didn&apos;t mean
                    to.&quot;</p>
                <p>He grasped my hand warmlydear, great-hearted fellow that he wasand so the &quot;incident was
                    closed,&quot; as the diplomats say.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-192" n="187"/>
                <p>If the incidents related in this chapter seem to any reader trivial, it must be admitted that in
                    themselves they are so. But they are related, as everything else in this most irregularly
                    constructed book is, by way of illustrating the life conditions that helped in the development of
                    Edward Eggleston&apos;s mind, and at the same time showing forth the native characteristics of a
                    person who was destined later to make his mark as a force in American life and letters.</p>
                <p>When the school year was over, Edward served for a time as a clerk in a store, kept by Mr. William
                    Shaw, a Scotchman of high and singularly lovable character, and his son, a man like unto himself,
                    who is still in active life. I do not know but that I should include Edward&apos;s association
                    with these two men of exceptional high-mindedness and purity as another of the forces that helped,
                    at the formative period of his life, to mould him into the man that he afterwards became. I know
                    that to the hour of his death he <pb id="VAA2342-193" n="188"/> lovingly cherished the memory of his
                    association with these two and with their families, as among the most precious of his recollections.</p>
                <p>In some way, too, he found time at this period to work gratuitously in the printing office of the
                    local newspaper, where he not only learned to set type, but practiced his writing gift by
                    contributing now and then to the newspaper&apos;s columns. When he did that he set up his
                    thought in type without previously putting it on paper. All the while he maintained his comradery
                    with Mrs. Dumont who, though she had ceased to be his teacher, continued to be not only his revered
                    friend, but also his mentor in all that pertained to his reading and thinking.</p>

                    these years was as a preparation for what was to follow in Edward Eggleston&apos;s moral and
                    intellectual development. Nor could any sequel to these years have been better for him than that
                    which came.</p>
                <p>Our father&apos;s relatives in Virginia had long urged that Edward should go to them for a
                    prolonged visit, and in June, 1854, when he was sixteen years of age, he and our only sister, four
                    or five years his junior, set out upon this first pilgrimage to the old home of our people. The
                    thirteen months of their absence constituted the first separation that had ever occurred between
                    Edward and myself. His stay in Virginia had an <pb id="VAA2342-195" n="190"/> important educational
                    influence upon his mind, and his letters thence influenced me in a way that few other things have
                    ever done.</p>
                <p>Our father&apos;s only brother, a childless man of middle age, was master of the old home
                    plantation in Amelia county, which had been the family seat since 1635. There all our race had been
                    nurtured for many generations. Adjoining that plantation was another Eggleston seat of like age in
                    family possession. This was &quot;Egglestetton,&quot; which had been the home of Major
                    Joseph Eggleston, of revolutionary fame, the cherished second in command of Light Horse Harry Lee.
                    At the time of Edward&apos;s stay in Virginia, this was the home of Major Joseph
                    Eggleston&apos;s descendants. These two plantations had been one at first, constituting a
                    princely domain. But when the father of Major Joseph Eggleston and his brother, our
                    great-grandfather, had come of age, the vast plantation had been divided between <pb
                        id="VAA2342-196" n="191"/> them. Since that time neither half of it had suffered any further
                    division, so that Edward found there in effect two ancestral homes open to him with a welcome. But
                    he dwelt in neither of them for any considerable time. He went instead to live mainly with our uncle
                    by marriage, Mr. Chastain Cocke, a planter and statesman, whose home was in the adjoining county of
                    Powhatan.</p>
                <p>Chastain Cocke was a man of unusual ability and of extraordinary character. I knew him well a little
                    later, and I have certainly never known any other man whom I have reckoned his superior in those
                    high qualities of manhood which there are still some of us left to revere in the name of chivalry.</p>
                <p>Never in all his life did Chastain Cocke knowingly do a wrong or an injustice to any human being,
                    great or humble, black or white, man, woman or child. Never in all his life did he fail in an
                    obligation or delay its fulfilment one hour beyond the appointed <pb id="VAA2342-197" n="192"/>
                    time, no matter how free he might be to delay, or how much of trouble it might cost him to meet his
                    duty on time. I remember one occasion when he impressed this lesson of good faith on my mind in a
                    striking way. His health was very frail at the time, and the weather was excessively bad, with a
                    distressing sleet storm on, which quickly rendered the clothing of any one venturing out a coat of
                    icy mail.</p>
                <p>He called me to him immediately after breakfast, and said to me:</p>
                <p>&quot;This is terrible weather, my boy, but you are robust and fearless, and I am sure you want
                    to oblige me.&quot;</p>
                <p>I promptly assured him that nothing could delight me more than to render him any possible service,
                    and that, as for bad weather, I rather rejoiced in braving it than shrank from its discomforts.</p>
                <p>&quot;I am sure of that,&quot; he said, &quot;and I thank you. I want you to pick out the
                    sturdiest horse in my stables this morning, <pb id="VAA2342-198" n="193"/> mount him and ride
                    to,&quot; naming a plantation thirty miles away. &quot;When you are ready I&apos;ll give
                    you your commission.&quot;</p>
                <p>I knew the horse I wantedan untamed stallion, seventeen hands high, with the temper of a maniac and
                    the physical endurance of a locomotive. Mounted upon that beast&apos;s back, booted and spurred,
                    and additionally equipped with a black-snake whip for disciplinary purposes, I departed on my
                    mission, which was simply to pay to my uncle&apos;s friend at the other end of the journey a few
                    hundred dollars which happened to be due on that day, on a purchase of land.</p>
                <p>When I reached my destination, after galloping a trifle of the superflous enthusiasm out of that
                    superb horse, the gentleman to whom I had been sent to make the payment, said to me:</p>
                <p>&quot;Has your uncle gone quite daft? Why should he make you ride thirty miles through a sleet
                    storm like this, merely to pay me money which he knows I don&apos;t want, and <pb
                        id="VAA2342-199" n="194"/> which I couldn&apos;t go out in such weather to pay out again,
                    even if I had pressing debts to meet, as I have not? Tell him for me, please, never to do such a
                    thing again. And now that you&apos;re safe here, I&apos;m going to keep you until the
                    weather grows reasonable again.&quot;</p>
                <p>I agreed to deliver the message, but declined the hospitality laughingly, on the ground that if that
                    demoniacal horse were left standing in a stable until the next morning, I might not be able to ride
                    him at all. My real reason for setting out on my return immediately after dinner, was that I knew
                    how anxious my good uncle would be about me until I should report all well at home again.</p>
                <p>When I stalked into the supper room that evening at 8 o&apos;clock, with all my garments frozen
                    stiff, my uncle welcomed me warmly enough to thaw them out; but he bade me go to my room, sending a
                    negro boy with me, and saying:</p>
                <p>&quot;I will not take another mouthful of <pb id="VAA2342-200" n="195"/> supper until you return.
                    The rest can go on with their meal. Nelson,&quot; (addressing the head dining room servant),
                    &quot;take my plate away. Lay a little table for your Mas&apos; George and myself, and send
                    word to Patty (the cook) to prepare the very best supper she can for us two.&quot; Then turning
                    to his wife, my father&apos;s sister, with that courtesy with which he never failed to treat her
                    whom he had made queen of his household, he said:</p>
                <p>&quot;Mary, my dear, you&apos;ll preside at our little table, I&apos;m sure. But
                    meanwhile please make your supper, for it isn&apos;t well for you to have your meals
                    disturbed.&quot;</p>
                <p>When we were seated at a cosy little table before the fire, for I was still shivering with cold after
                    my sixty miles&apos; ride in the storm, I delivered the messages that had been given to me. In
                    response my uncle said, with exceeding emphasis:</p>
                <p>&quot;George, I should have made that terrible journey myself to-day if I had not had <pb
                        id="VAA2342-201" n="196"/> your young mini&apos;s vigor and your good will to act as my
                    substitute. Of course I knew that Mr.did not care to have that money paid to-day; but all my lite I
                    have made it a rule to pay every dollar I owed on the precise day on which it was due, no matter if
                    it cost me two dollars for every one dollar owed. The result of that is that my name is good in
                    every bank in Richmond for any sum that I may happen to want. Let me commend that rule to you.
                    Remember always that when you promise to pay money on the 21st of a given month, your creditor is
                    entitled to expect it on that day, and not on the 22d. He may have obligations of his own to meet,
                    and he may have counted upon your prompt payment as his means of meeting them. No man need undertake
                    an obligation unless he wishes to do so. But having undertaken it, he is in honor bound to fulfil
                    it, no matter what happens. Now, you haven&apos;t said a word about it, but I know that you had
                    to swim a <pb id="VAA2342-202" n="197"/> swollen river twice to-day, in order to make this payment
                    for me. I did not hesitate to ask you to do that in redemption of my honor, because I knew the
                    loyalty of your affection. But if I had not had you for a substitute, I should have made the journey
                    myself, swimming the river as a necessary part of the proceeding.&quot;</p>
                <p>How true it was that Chastain Cocke&apos;s name was good in any Richmond bank for any sum that he
                    might ask for, and all because of his life-long habit of meeting every obligation in the hour of its
                    falling due, is best illustrated by the record of a certain trying experience.</p>
                <p>Besides his home plantation in Virginia, he had two cotton plantations in Mississippi. The two used a
                    single gin house, and one year that gin house burned, destroying the whole of his cotton crop. It
                    became necessary for him to borrow a large sum of money to cover his domestic and plantation
                    expenses until another crop should come in.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-203" n="198"/>
                <p>The bank in Richmond readily advanced the money.</p>
                <p>About that time a friend of his own, a man of old family and high repute, who was an inveterate and
                    incurable visionary, asked Chastain Cocke to endorse his paper in order that he might raise the
                    money necessary to carry out one of his many wild schemes. My uncle refused, upon the ground that he
                    could not regard the project as a sound one. But his friend was so sure of its safety that he forged
                    Mr. Cocke&apos;s endorsement upon a note for five thousand dollars. He fully intended to take up
                    the note before it should fall due, so that nobody should ever know of the forgery and nobody should
                    be harmed by it.</p>
                <p>As usually happens in such cases, the enterprise failed, and one day my uncle received notice that a
                    note for five thousand dollars, signed by his friend and endorsed by himself, would fall due within
                    three days, and that, as the drawer of the note had given <pb id="VAA2342-204" n="199"/> notice of
                    his inability to pay, the bank must look to Mr. Cocke to meet the obligation.</p>
                <p>This news came like a thunder clap out of a clear sky to my uncle. He had never before heard of the
                    note in question, but he promptly went to Richmond and, visiting the bank, asked to see the paper. A
                    glance at it revealed the entire situation to him. But the guilty man was the representative of an
                    old and highly honored family. He had a wife and daughters who must suffer lasting disgrace should
                    this thing become known. So my uncle decided that no exposure should be made, if by any
                    self-sacrifice he could avoid that misfortune. He said to the bank officer:</p>
                <p>&quot;I had not expected to be called upon to pay this note. I have made no preparation for the
                    emergency. I am already in debt to the bank.&quot;</p>
                <p>Here the bank officer interrupted him to say:</p>
                <p>&quot;That makes no difference whatever, <pb id="VAA2342-205" n="200"/> Mr. Cocke. You can take
                    up this paper with your own note at whatever time you may choose to make it payablethree months
                    hence, or three years if you prefer.&quot;</p>
                <p>Chastain Cocke did that generous thing. In order to save the wife and daughters of his erring friend
                    from the disgrace which exposure would have brought upon them, he deliberately executed his note for
                    five thousand dollars which he did not owe, and, upon going home, cast into the fire the evidence of
                    his friend&apos;s misconduct.</p>
                <p>But this was not destined to be the end of the matter. A little later my uncle was summoned to serve
                    upon the grand jury of his county. Under Virginian law every grand juryman was required to pledge
                    himself, under oath, to report to the grand jury any and every criminal act of which he might have
                    had cognizance within a prescribed period. This note forgery came within the period fixed upon by
                    the statute, and if Chastain Cocke had taken the oath of a <pb id="VAA2342-206" n="201"/> grand
                    juryman he must have reported the facts. This he was in no wise minded to do, so he asked to be
                    excused from grand jury service. The court declined to excuse him, whereupon he said: &quot;Then
                    I must respectfully decline to serve.&quot;</p>
                <p>The Judge answered:</p>
                <p>&quot;But, Mr. Cocke, you have no option in this matter. The court orders you to serve, and you
                    must.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;But I cannot, if the court please, without violating what I deem to be an obligation of
                    sacred honor, and surely you do not wish to compel me to do that. You cannot compel me, indeed, for
                    under no compulsion, no matter what the penalty may be, will I take the grand juror&apos;s oath
                    to-day.&quot;</p>
                <p>Feeling that it would not do to excuse so prominent a citizen while refusing to excuse others, the
                    Judge pleaded earnestly with him, finally asking him to state his reason for refusing to serve. To
                    that Mr. Cocke replied:</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-207" n="202"/>
                <p>&quot;It so happens that I know of a felony committed within this jurisdiction within the last
                    six months. I alone am the victim of that crime, but should I reveal it other and altogether
                    innocent peoplewomen and young girlsmust suffer cruel and lasting disgrace. I have accepted the rle
                    of victim. I have made a sore pecuniary sacrifice in order to conceal the facts of this matter facts
                    which concern nobody on earth but myselffrom public knowledge. I have destroyed all evidence in the
                    case. I cannot serve on this grand jury without swearing to reveal those facts, and so, with the
                    profoundest respect for the court, I must positively and peremptorily decline to serve.&quot;</p>
                <p>The judge was terribly troubled. He walked back and forth upon the bench in agonizing distress of
                    mind. Finally he turned to Mr. Cocke and said:</p>
                <p>&quot;My duty compels me to insist upon your service. If you refuse, it will be my duty to fine
                    you to the full extent of your <pb id="VAA2342-208" n="203"/> property, and to imprison you until
                    such time as you shall yield. Mr. Cocke, you simply <hi rend="i">must</hi> serve.&quot;</p>
                <p>To this my uncle answered: &quot;It grieves me to subject your honor to any embarrassment. But I
                    simply cannot serve as a grand juryman to-day, and I will not. Your honor knows far better than I
                    do, for I am not a lawyer, what your duty is, and I have no doubt that you will discharge it, even
                    if it strips me of all earthly possessions and condemns me to pass the remainder of my days in jail.
                    You, sir, are too much a man of honor not to understand me when I say to you that in my judgment I
                    cannot serve as a grand juror to-day without making such a sacrifice of honor as would be impossible
                    to you, and is equally impossible to me. Finally, and once for all, with the utmost respect for the
                    court, I positively decline to serve, and as a citizen accustomed to submit to the law, I await your
                    sentence.&quot;</p>
                <p>Again the judge paced backwards and <pb id="VAA2342-209" n="204"/> forwards in the space in rear of
                    the bench. After a time he turned to the clerk and asked:</p>
                <p>&quot;Mr. Clerk, what is Mr. Cocke worth, over and above his debts?&quot;</p>
                <p>The clerk told him. Then he paced his beat again for a time, after which he paused and said:</p>
                <p>&quot;Mr. Cocke, you must.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Your honor, I cannot,&quot; was the smiling answer of the man who, for the sake of his
                    honor, stood ready to forfeit not only all his earthly possessions, but his liberty besides.</p>
                <p>Then suddenly the judge turned to the clerk, saying:</p>
                <p>&quot;Mr. Clerk, enter it as the judgment of this court that Mr. Chastain Cocke shall pay a line
                    of one dollar and be imprisoned for the space of one minute in the county jail. And, Mr. Clerk,
                    enter upon the minutes that in the deliberate judgment of this court, I am not fit to be a
                    judge.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-210" n="205"/>
                <p>My uncle bowed to the decision, and moved off toward the sheriff to submit himself to arrest. But the
                    &quot;body of the county,&quot; represented by the citizens there assembled, were not so
                    submissively minded. Chastain Cocke was their senator in the State Legislature. He was a Whig, and
                    both the county and the senatorial district were strongly Democratic. But that never made any
                    difference when Chastain Cocke announced himself as a candidate for either house of the Legislature.
                    He was always elected by a majority that sent party divisions out of sight, and he might have been
                    elected to Congress in the same way, had he seen in Congress any opportunity to serve his
                    constituents well.</p>
                <p>Court day always brought the whole &quot;body of the county&quot; to the county seat, and
                    when it was noised abroad that Chastain Cocke was in controversy with the court all the citizenry
                    that could gain entrance forced their way into the court room. When sentence <pb id="VAA2342-211"
                        n="206"/> was pronounced, they all precipitately left the building and assembled on the green
                    outside. When the sheriff came out with his prisoner, whom he was commanded to incarcerate for the
                    space of one minute, he found his way toward the jail obstructed by a mob that included all the best
                    citizens of the county, and practically all other ablebodied dwellers in that political division.</p>
                <p>These men clamorously insisted that their honored fellow-citizen should not be taken to the jail. In
                    the enforcement of their prohibition they had armed themselves with guns, axes, crowbars and
                    whatever else they could secure in the way of offensive or defensive weapons.</p>
                <p>Seeing the situation, my uncle asked the sheriff for a box on which he might stand to address the
                    mob. Securing that elevated position he made an impassioned appeal to the populace. He begged them
                    to let the law take its course. He reminded them that, as their senator, he was himself a law <pb
                        id="VAA2342-212" n="207"/> giver, and that it would be a peculiar shame to him if the law should
                    be defied and overridden in his behalf. He explained to them that the judge was absolutely right,
                    except that he ought to have imposed a severer penalty. He assured them that, in submitting to the
                    prescribed imprisonment ol one minute, he should feel no humiliation of disgrace. He earnestly
                    begged his fellow citizens to let the sheriff carry out his orders in vindication of the majesty of
                    the law.</p>
                <p>It was all to no purpose. The people&apos;s mind was made up. No sooner had he stepped down from
                    his goods-box platform than one of the oldest and most honored men of that community mounted it.
                    With his thin but long gray locks floating in the wind, and the bare top of his head exposed to the
                    glaring sun, the old man seemed like an angel of authority as he lifted his spare and tremulous hand
                    to command silence. When the hush came, the old man, with his hand still raised to heaven, said:</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-213" n="208"/>
                <p>&quot;Thou, God, seest us! Thou only can search hearts and judge them.&quot; Then turning to
                    the sea of uplifted faces all about him, he said: &quot;Fellow citizens:<hi rend="i"
                    >Resolved</hi>, That Chastain Cocke shall never be imprisoned for one second in any jail of which
                    this community is the owner. Those in favor of that resolution say aye!&quot;</p>
                <p>It was needless, but he added: &quot;If any are opposed they will say no!&quot;</p>
                <p>Then turning to the sheriff he said:</p>
                <p>&quot;Mr. Sheriff, you have heard the unanimous verdict of this community. That verdict, as you
                    very well know, is final and irrevocable.&quot;</p>
                <p>There was nothing for the sheriff to do but return to the court and report that he had been prevented
                    &quot;by force of arms&quot; from executing the decree of imprisonment. Thereupon the judge
                    said:</p>
                <p>&quot;The court regards the detention of the prisoner for several minutes in the custody of the
                    sheriff as the full equivalent of <pb id="VAA2342-214" n="209"/> the imprisonment ordered. Mr.
                    Clerk, call the cases on the calendar.&quot;<ref id="ref_002" rend="super" target="note_002"

                </p>
                <p>These incidents are related here in detail in order to show under what influences Edward Eggleston
                    fell at this peculiarly receptive period of his life. Mr. Chastain Cocke was exceptional in his
                    ability and in the courage with which he confronted duty; hut his principles, his theories of
                    conduct, were only such as all the better class of men in that community at that time accepted and
                    acted upon. Our father&apos;s brother at the old homestead, and our cousin who represented
                    another branch of the family at Egglestetton, obeyed the same law of honorable obligation quite as
                    unquestioningly as he did. So did all the better men of Virginia with whom Edward was at this time
                    brought into close relations, and the influence of such men upon <pb id="VAA2342-215" n="210"/> his
                    character and his point of view, was untellably important as a formative influence.<note

                        <p>I have already made use of this incident in a novel, transferring it to another time and
                            calling the actors in it by fictitious names. But surely, as more than half a century has
                            passed since the occurrence, and after everybody concerned in it has passed away, there can
                            be no reason why I should not tell the story in its nakedness without disguise or
                            concealment, except such as is involved in the suppression of the offender&apos;s
                                name.A<hi rend="sc">UTHOR</hi>.</p>
                    </note>
                </p>
                <p>In his earlier boyhood the only appeal made to him had been to a sense of religious obligation to act
                    for the safety of his own soul. He was now taught that there were obligations altogether independent
                    of religious duty, obligations of mere manhood and self-respect, that must be fulfilled even if it
                    should be demonstrated that there was no God in the Universe, no judgment day, and no future life of
                    rewards and punishments. Here was a new thought and a mightily uplifting onethe thought, namely,
                    that every man owes it to himself to maintain a certain standard of conduct, quite irrespective of
                    his responsibility to the Deity or to any other tribunal than that of self-respect and conscience
                    and honor. Not in fear of punishment, not in dread of a day of judgment, not upon any selfish or
                    cowardly account, but solely as a matter of self-respect, of soul-cleanliness, one must meet his
                    obligations <pb id="VAA2342-216" n="211"/> unflinchingly and discharge them in utter disregard of
                    cost or of personal consequences of any kind. That was the new gospel that Edward learned in
                    Virginia, and, as he afterwards said, no boy ever stood more prcssingly in need of such a lesson for
                    the correction of the false and futile teachings of his earlier life.</p>
                <p>Under the former teaching no man was expected to be scrupulous in the performance of duty unless he
                    &quot;professed religion&quot; and held himself subject to the requirements of a formulated
                    creed. Under the new teaching Edward learned that conductwhich Matthew Arnold truly says is
                    &quot;two-thirds of life&quot;is wholly independent of religious belief and that obligation
                    rests upon a sense of right and wrong altogether apart from any theological belief or any scheme of
                    rewards and punishments.</p>
                <p>Still another influence to which Edward Eggleston was subjected at this time was that of Mr. William
                    H. Harrison, school <pb id="VAA2342-217" n="212"/> master at the Wigwam. This was for more than a
                    generation a noted boarding-school for boys, as wholesome in its influences as the Gunnery in
                    Connecticut was. The master of it was a man of great ability, great learning and a character as
                    white and clean as that of any child. Edward quickly learned to love Mr. Harrison, and Mr. Harrison
                    quickly learned to love Edward. The two not only worked together in the orderly course of school
                    employments, but they came presently to think together, to discuss together those larger questions
                    of life and conduct which lie beyond and above school work.</p>
                <p>The half year that Edward spent under Mr. Harrison&apos;s tuition was the last of his school
                    life. He had made himself master of Latin, French and mathematics as few college graduates of that
                    time ever did, and he had laid a secure foundation in Greek, upon which he afterwards built, after
                    his custom, by a course of self-directed study. Up to this time he had owed comparatively <pb
                        id="VAA2342-218" n="[]"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2342-8">
                        <p>THE HANGING ROCK, NEAR MADISON, INDIANA<lb/> A favorite haunt of Edward Eggleston from
                            boyhood to old age</p>
                    </figure>
                    <pb id="VAA2342-219" n="213"/> little to schoolmasters. He never afterwards increased that debt.</p>
                <p>One other thing. In the old Virginia houses which were his homes at. this time, there were always
                    well-stocked libraries. These included next to nothing of strictly modern literature, but they were
                    rich in all the classics of our language, and Edward diligently read them through, as I did in my
                    turn a little later. It used to be said of him afterwards that he could never be tempted to change
                    his quarters and pay a prolonged visit in any house until he had read clear through the library of
                    the house he was in.</p>
                <p>I think the glamour of that easy-going, restful and exquisitely self-poised Virginian life did not
                    appeal to Edward at all so strongly as it did to me when a year or two later I was brought into
                    contact with it. To me it was the complete realization of romance, the actual embodiment of poetry,
                    a dream life of exquisite perfection. It was a hundred years behind the times, but for that <pb
                        id="VAA2342-220" n="214"/> very reason it fascinated my mind as nothing else has done, before or
                    since. It violated all the maxims of prudence that had lain at the basis of my education, but I was
                    overjoyed to be rid of allegiance to these. It ran counter to all I had learned of strenuousness,
                    but I was weary of strenuousness, and I welcomed the restfulness of this dreamy life of perfect
                    peace. It was not so with Edward. He believed, with intense sincerity, in a life of endeavor, of
                    action, of absolute earnestness. The idleness of the Virginian life was grateful enough to him as a
                    sort of vacation, but as a life to be led indefinitely it offended his sense of human obligation,
                    and he could in no wise reconcile himself to it as a permanent mode of existence.</p>
                <p>More important still, that life was founded upon slavery, and Edward&apos;s mind revolted against
                    slavery with an antagonism that nothing could overcome or weaken.</p>
                <p>In Virginia, of course, he saw the institution <pb id="VAA2342-221" n="215"/> in its least offensive
                    ami most pleasing aspect. Slavery there was almost purely patriarchal in its character. The
                    relatives and friends with whom he associated had inherited their servantsfor they never spoke of
                    them as slavesprecisely as they had inherited their acres and their family traditions and their
                    family debts, and all the rest of it. They treated the relation of master and servant as one of
                    mutual obligation. They strongly felt their responsibility for the welfare of their black
                    dependents. They never thought of buying or selling negroes. It was not even respectable to do so,
                    except in the case of a criminal negro, who must either be &quot;sold off south&quot; or
                    sent to the State prison. The negroes in Virginia at that time were, without question, better
                    compensated for their labor than any other laboring class has ever been anywhere on earth. Not only
                    were they the best housed, the best clothed and the best fed of laborers, but they were secure of
                    tender care in infancy, in illness and in <pb id="VAA2342-222" n="216"/> old age, as no other
                    laboring people ever were before or since.</p>
                <p>Thus slavery presented its most attractive side to the Hoosier boy&apos;s mind. But it was
                    slavery, nevertheless, and he would none of it. Instead of being won by its pleasing patriarchal
                    presentment, he was repelled actively where before his sentiment of hostility to the institution had
                    been mainly sentimental and passive.</p>
                <p>Edward was not a fanatic on this subject, though he felt strongly concerning it. He did not make
                    himself offensive in discussing the matter, as so many people at that time thought it their duty to
                    do. He did not thrust his opinions upon those about him, but he stoutly held and did not conceal
                    them.</p>
                <p>In all this he found much of sympathy in Virginia. The better class of Virginians of that time
                    lamented slavery as an inherited curse of which they would gladly have rid themselves if they had
                    known how. They <pb id="VAA2342-223" n="217"/> felt, as Thomas Jefferson had felt, a strong desire
                    to set the negroes free; but they saw, as he did, that it would not do to &quot;arm these people
                    with freedom and a dagger;&quot; that to set them free without providing them with some means of
                    earning a living, would be to inflict a curse upon them and to set society on its head, as it were.
                    It was in fear of this that Virginian law forbade the freeing of negro slaves within the State. So
                    many of the Virginians of that time were soul-weary of the institution that but for such laws a
                    considerable proportion of the negroes would have been set free by act of their owners, or by
                    provisions like those that John Randolph had written into his will. In the past many Virginians had
                    done this by way of freeing themselves and their children from the incubus of slavery. Conspicuous
                    among these had been Virginia&apos;s great chancellor, George Wythe, who, inheriting a large
                    estate, actually impoverished himself in setting free the negroes that had come to him <pb
                        id="VAA2342-224" n="218"/> from his fathers, and in providing them with the means of earning a
                    livelihood. Many scores of other Virginians had taken their negroes to the West and settled them on
                    little farms there, at cost of impoverishment to themselves. John Letcher, the governor of Virginia
                    during the Civil War, had for years openly advocated the abolition of slavery, not so much for the
                    sake of the negroes as for the salvation of the young white men of Virginia from influences which he
                    regarded as evil. Despairing of general emancipation, he proposed and stoutly advocated the division
                    of the State, and the erection of its western half into a free State. His abolitionism was the chief
                    factor in making him governor.</p>
                <p>The desire for emancipation at the time of Edward&apos;s stay in Virginia, was very general. But
                    there were insuperable obstacles in the way of the realization of that desire. The planter who
                    wished to free his slaves must take them beyond the borders of the <pb id="VAA2342-225" n="219"/>
                    State and there provide them with little farms. In the greater number of cases this was impossible.
                    There was an hereditary debt upon almost every plantation, and the land, without the negroes, would
                    not sell for enough to cover that debt and pay the expense of the deportation of the blacks.</p>
                <p>It was a time of relentless anti-slavery agitation at the north, and the southern people, including
                    those who most earnestly desired emancipation, bitterly resented what they believed to be an unjust
                    and unwarranted interference with their domestic affairs on the part of people not concerned with
                    them. They looked upon such agitation as an impertinence that gravely threatened their wives and
                    children with all the horrors of a servile war. But for a rational, intellectual and moral
                    condemnation of the system, such as Edward Eggleston freely avowed, they had no resentment and no
                    word of censure. It commanded their sympathy rather than their hostility.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-226" n="220"/>
                <p>But it forbade Edward to avail himself of an opportunity. Our childless uncle wished to adopt him and
                    educate him, first at the University of Virginia, and afterwards at one of the great German seats of
                    learning. But eager as the boy was for precisely such educational opportunities, his conscience
                    impelled him to decline the offer, on the ground that it would make of him the beneficiary of slave
                    labor, a sharer in the profits of a system which he regarded as morally wrong.</p>
                <p>Having come to this decision, the boy felt himself bound to return to his native State, Indiana, and
                    he did so, thus making a final end of his schooling, which might otherwise have included a course at
                    the Univer sity of Virginia and some years of study at Heidelberg or Jena.</p>

                <head type="subtitle">Some Revelations of Character.</head>
                <p>D<hi rend="sc">URING</hi> Edward&apos;s stay in Virginia the family was removed again to Madison,
                    chiefly because I had been sent there so that I might attend the High Schoolthe Vevay schools
                    offering no further opportunities for me, now that Mrs. Dumont was compelled by increasing years and
                    by ill health to give up teaching.</p>
                <p>I remember an occurrence soon after Edward&apos;s return from Virginia, which illustrates his
                    self-sacrificing character, and which is, therefore, worth relating. I had always been a notable
                    swimmer, and to me swimming seemed scarcely more difficult as an art than walking. One evening
                    Edward and I went to the river for a bath. We pushed out from shore and continued on our course <pb
                        id="VAA2342-228" n="222"/> till we neared the middle of the river. Then suddenly Edward said to
                    me:</p>
                <p>&quot;Geordie, I&apos;m exhausted. I must sink here and drown. Don&apos;t try to save me.
                    That would only involve you, too, in my drowning. Leave me here and swim ashore if you have
                    strength.&quot;</p>
                <p>I do not think I ever knew anything more heroic than that, though afterwards I had an experience of
                    four years of strenuous war, abounding in heroic deeds. I was impressed by his calm courage, and
                    touched by his impulse of self-sacrifice. But I laughed aloud at the foolishness of his proposal. I
                    had swum five times across that river without touching bottom, and I could have swum ten times or
                    twenty times across it with scarcely an effort. The little space of a quarter mile or so that lay
                    between us and the shore seemed to me ridiculously of no consequence. Laughing and jeering for my
                    brother&apos;s encouragement, I commanded him to place his hands on my shoulders, and <pb
                        id="VAA2342-229" n="223"/> he did so, all unwillingly, lest he imperil my life by what he deemed
                    an overtaxing of my strength. I swam ashore with him as easily as I might have walked a block and
                    laid him on the sands to rest and recover his breath. When that was done I asked him:</p>
                <p>&quot;What sort of a brother do you take me for, anyhow? Did you seriously think I would leave
                    you to drown out there in the river, and make no effort to save you?&quot;</p>
                <p>I saw that he was weeping, so I said no more in my bantering way. Presently he recovered himself and
                    said to me, taking my hand:</p>
                <p>&quot;Geordie, it was God who taught you how to swim like that.&quot;</p>
                <p>My theology has always been badly crippled, but in that moment I rejoiced that God or long practice
                    had given me a skill in swimming sufficient to save my brother&apos;s life.</p>
                <p>It was soon after this that Edward organized a little club of us boys, called the &quot;<hi
                        rend="b">XII</hi>,&quot; <pb id="VAA2342-230" n="224"/> for the reason that it was our
                    purpose to limit the membership to twelve persons. Edward had been reading the autobiography of
                    Benjamin Franklin, and in the formation of our club he had had the Junta in mind.</p>
                <p>The club never reached its membership limit in our time, at least, though I believe it still exists,
                    with somewhat changed purposes and a much larger membership than that at first contemplated. It was
                    a secret society, and like most other associations of the kind, its secrets were few and of no
                    consequence. It had its passwords and its hailing signs, and all the rest of the semi-masonic
                    equipment. For curiosity&apos;s sake, I practiced the old hailing signs in the streets of
                    Madison in 1900, and received ready responses from the younger generation of XII&apos;s who
                    still preserve the organization.</p>
                <p>Our meeting place when the little society was formed, was Edward&apos;s room and mine, in East
                    Street. The purpose of the society was self-improvement by debate, essay <pb id="VAA2342-231"
                        n="225"/> writing, the systematic reading of books, and especially conversation. As an
                    illustration of the prejudice of that time I may relate that after a hot debate we refused to admit
                    one boy to the club solely because he was a Roman Catholic in religion. Obviously our
                    narrow-mindedness needed all of enlightenment that we sought in organizing the XII. Half a century
                    later Edward remembered this incident with regret and humiliation. &quot;What a lot of young
                    bigots we were,&quot; he said to me one day at Lake George, &quot;when we voted to exclude
                    George Griffin on account of his religion! We&apos;ve all outgrown that since, but I
                    can&apos;t forget that we were once capable of such prejudice.&quot; Then, after a pause, he
                    added:</p>
                <p>&quot;We ought, all of us, to be immortal, Geordie; we shall need an eternity in which to repent
                    of our errors.&quot;</p>
                <p>About this time there arose the question of my education beyond what the schools of Madison could
                    give me. Our mother, out <pb id="VAA2342-232" n="226"/> of her scant possessions, had many years
                    before contributed one hundred dollars to the endowment of the Indiana Asbury University, at
                    Greencastle, and had become possessed, in return, of a perpetual scholarship in that institution.
                    This scholarship entitled her to send one student to the University free of all charge for tuition.
                    I had gone as far as the High School in Madison could take me in the direction of a liberal
                    education. But then, as now, the High School course was completely out of accord with college
                    requirements. In mathematics I was fully equipped to enter the Junior class at college. In certain
                    other studies, notably chemistry and physics, I was fit to pass the Senior examination for
                    graduation. But I knew almost no Latin and no Greek. The Greek did not so greatly matter, as the
                    colleges at that time were accustomed to regard that language as a &quot;lame duck,&quot; to
                    be brought up after entrance. But I must know enough of Latin to read at sight, to conjugate the <pb
                        id="VAA2342-233" n="227"/> principal verbs, to decline the nouns and adjectives, and to convert
                    simple English sentences into correct Latin.</p>
                <p>A sudden ambition had seized me to &quot;go to college,&quot; as the phrase went. Indeed
                    there was nowhere else for me to go, there being no school in Madison which offered any advance upon
                    the curriculum that I had mastered. But I was wholly unprepared, so far as the Latin requirement was
                    concerned, and the case seemed hopelessto everybody except Edward. He had used himself to the
                    performance of astonishing things in the way of study, and he was in no way appalled by the false
                    magnitude given by the curriculums to requirements of study. He had often himself done in a week or
                    two what the schools set down as a year&apos;s work, and he saw no reason why I should not do
                    the same, particularly as my gift of quick acquisition was marked, while my memory was positively
                    phenomenal in its readiness and its tenacity. Indeed the ease with which <pb id="VAA2342-234"
                        n="228"/> I learned whatever I was set to learn, had up to this time been the chief obstacle in
                    the way of my education. I had never in my life studied diligently, for the simple reason that I had
                    never found it necessary to do so in order to keep up with my classes. Edward knew this, and he
                    reckoned with it as the chief factor in the situation. He went to our mother with the proposal that
                    I should enter college at the beginning of the term two or three weeks away. Our mother pointed out
                    my lack of instruction in Latin.</p>
                <p>&quot;I know all that,&quot; Edward said. &quot;But I&apos;ll take care of that. If
                    you consent to his going to college, I will undertake to prepare him for his examinations.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward was at that time not yet eighteen years of age, but the maturity of his wisdom was such that
                    everybody about him looked up to him as to a counsellor whose words were weighty far beyond those of
                    any other. I think our mother hearkened to them with quite all the submissiveness that she had ever
                        <pb id="VAA2342-235" n="229"/> shown to the injunctions of our father, whom she had revered with
                    the utmost devotion that a loving wife can feel.</p>
                <p>Having gained our mother&apos;s consent, Edward came to me.</p>
                <p>&quot;Now, Geordie,&quot; he said, &quot;you have never studied in your life. You have
                    always stood at the head of your classes when you chose to do so, but usually you haven&apos;t
                    cared for that. Now, for the first time in your life, you are going to work in earnest. You are
                    going to learn in two weeks all the Latin that the schools teach in two years. You can do it, and I
                    am going to <hi rend="i">make</hi> you do it. You shall enter college with flying colors, but in
                    order to do so you&apos;ve got to work in a way that you never did before.&quot;</p>
                <p>I was eager for this thing, and I welcomed the work. Our breakfast was served at eight
                    o&apos;clock. At six every morning Edward waked me. He allowed me precisely twenty minutes for a
                    cold bath and for dressing. That left one hour and forty minutes <pb id="VAA2342-236" n="230"/> for
                    paradigms, and not until I could recite them perfectly did he allow me to go to breakfast. After the
                    morning meal he allowed me half an hour for exercisewhich consisted of sawing and splitting wood and
                    milking the cow. Then he held me to my Latin again until the noon-day meal. And after dinner he made
                    me &quot;buckle down to study,&quot; as he phrased it, until supper time. After supper he
                    permitted me to go swimming, but at eight o&apos;clock he had me at work again over my Latin,
                    and he kept me at it until eleven. Then I went to bed and to sleep.</p>
                <p>Eight days of this accomplished the purpose. At the end of that time I knew all the principal
                    paradigms, could read any ordinary Latin at sight, and could translate any simple English sentence
                    into fairly correct Latin.</p>
                <p>Then Edward called a halt. There were still seven days ahead of me before I must offer myself for my
                    entrance examinations.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-237" n="231"/>
                <p>But, wise teacher that he was, Edward decreed that these seven days should be given to rest and
                    recreation. &quot;The only thing that I&apos;m afraid of,&quot; he said, &quot;is
                    that your nerves may play you a trick after this debauch of study. So you and I are going to spend
                    the next seven days in the woods out yonder on the hills. You aren&apos;t even to think of Latin
                    until the time of your examination arrives.&quot;</p>
                <p>Then we went away to the hills, and for a week we gathered trilobites and otherwise interested
                    ourselves in that study of geology which some of the preachers of that ignorant time tried in vain
                    to forbid to us as a &quot;Godless science.&quot;</p>
                <p>The region around Madison was geologically rich in an extreme degree, and thanks to the stupidity of
                    engineering at the time when our railroad was built, the hills in rear of us had been cut through
                    with a great gash a hundred and fifty or two hundred feet deep, where now a tunnel would take the
                    place of the cut. The <pb id="VAA2342-238" n="232"/> geological formation tempted us, and both
                    Edward and I were sufficiently self-instructed in geology to take advantage of our opportunities.
                    Edward had read to me &quot;The Old Red Sandstone&quot; and &quot;The Testimony of the
                    Rocks&quot; and the &quot;Vestiges of Creation,&quot; and together we had studied the
                    best of the school geologies of that time. Better stillthough we did not then know how much better
                    it waswe had passed many months of delightful days among our native hills, trying to find out for
                    ourselves what nature had written in the rocks and trees and plant life for our instruc tion as to
                    the purposes and methods of creation. We had questioned God as to his ordering of the Universe,
                    reverently seeking an answer, but in doing so we had offended against the theological zeitgeist.
                    Then, as now, then as always since ever the foundations of the world were laid, theology claimed for
                    itself a close monopoly of truth. It held facts to be heretical in so far as they <pb
                        id="VAA2342-239" n="233"/> might seem to contradict dogmas. It sought to set limits to human
                    inquiry and to impose restraints upon thought.</p>
                <p>To me these things made little difference. I was born a skeptic, a doubter, an inquirer. There was a
                    hole in my head, I think, at that point where the phrenologists locate the bump of veneration. I had
                    been born with an eager desire to know, and in the gratification of that desire I had never in the
                    least cared whether a fact found out squared itself with any theory or flatly contradicted it. My
                    attitude of mind, though I did not then know it, was purely scientific.</p>
                <p>Not so Edward&apos;s. He was still under strong bonds to theology, and in his modesty of mind he
                    had not yet realized his own intellectual superiority to those half educated &quot;pastors and
                    masters&quot; who sought at this time to bind his soul with shackles.</p>
                <p>A strenuous effort was made by those pastors and masters to stop Edward and me from the study of
                    geology. The only effect <pb id="VAA2342-240" n="234"/> of this upon me was to stimulate further and
                    more fearless study. &quot;The preachers,&quot; I said to Edward, &quot;are afraid of
                    science. Why? Isn&apos;t it because the facts contradict their teachings and their theories? I
                    confess I don&apos;t know, but I am going to find out if I can.&quot;</p>
                <p>Then Edward underwent a period of sore wrestling over his obligations toward my soul, which entity,
                    if it exists, I gravely fear was never worthy of his concern for its welfare. After thinking the
                    matter out, he came to me one day and said something like this:</p>
                <p>&quot;After all, we know that God calls these men to preach; presumably he inspires them with
                    impulses of what to preach. We are mere boys. Have we a right to think for ourselves in opposition
                    to what these divinely commissioned teachers tell us is the truth?&quot;</p>
                <p>For answer I said:</p>
                <p>&quot;Are theyall of themcalled to preach? Are theyall of themdivinely <pb id="VAA2342-241"
                        n="235"/> inspired as to their teaching? I saw one of them at camp meeting, the other day, fall
                    into a foolish passion because the points of his only standing collar didn&apos;t coincide on
                    the two sides of his mouth. He had been appointed to preach that afternoon and he had his sermon
                    ready, but he gave it up and lied about it, saying he was ill, and let some-body else preach in his
                    stead, simply because he couldn&apos;t get that collar right. Was that man God-commissioned to
                    preach? Or was he collar-commissioned not to do so, because there was a girl out there in the
                    audience whom he wanted to marry? &quot; Edward was at this time reading Theo-dore Parker and
                    William Ellery Charming and Emerson, and his mind was opening in a way that sadly distressed the
                    ministers who were watching his development with a foreshadow-ing that its course did not tend to
                    orthodoxy and that this gifted boy was destined to be-come a power in the worldperhaps a power
                    dangerous to their dominance.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-242" n="236"/>
                <p>During his sojourn in Virginia Edward had been brought for a time into intimate personal relations
                    with Dr. Josiah Clark Nott, the author of &quot;Types of Mankind,&quot; &quot;Indigenous
                    Races of the Earth,&quot; and other learned works in Ethnology. The strangely old boy of 17 or
                    18, and the strangely young thinker of fifty odd, had become inseparable companions, and Edward had
                    learned from Dr. Nott the primary lesson of scienceabsolute fearlessness of thought and inquiry.
                    These twothe man sorely stricken in health and feeble far beyond his years, and the eager-minded
                    boyspent days and nights together, often sitting up in converse until morning broke upon them. From
                    that asso-ciation Edward had brought away much of the scientific spirit, and he now haltingly and
                    timidly applied it as he and I wandered over the hills about Madison, and studied nature at first
                    hand in that wonderful railroad cut of which I do not know the like for geo-logical opportunity
                    anywhere.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-243" n="237"/>
                <p>I shall never forget a seance that my brother and I had about that time with the Presiding Elder of
                    our district. The good old man was sorely troubled about us, and especially about our geological
                    studies. He explained to us that geology was a science which &quot;sought to leave God out of
                    the story of creation,&quot; and when Edward ventured to suggest that Bishop Upshur&apos;s
                    chronology was not inspired, and might possibly be wrong, the dear, devout old gentleman met the
                    plea with a proposal of &quot;earnest prayer for the salvation of a young soul from the
                    labyrinth of pseudo-scientific doubt.&quot; I remember his phrase all the more accurately for
                    the reason that at the time I had only the vaguest possible notion of what it meant, and also
                    because he did not include my soul as an entity worth praying for. The old gentleman prayed over
                    Edward very earnestly, and he tearfully urged us to give up our pursuit of what he called
                    &quot;that godless and infidel science.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-244" n="238"/>
                <p>For three days our little geological hammers remained idle. Then we visited McCormack and got new
                    light.</p>
                <p>McCormack was a somewhat out-of-theway personage, who dwelt in Madison and had a singularly
                    miscellaneous workshop and laboratory there. He bore the reputation of being half-crazya reputation
                    chiefly based, I now think, upon the fact that he knew more and thought more freely and more
                    daringly than it was at that time permitted to men to know and to think. He was an inventor. He had
                    constructed a device of air-pumps and the like, that enabled him to walk upon ceilings, and he had
                    gone all the way round the world giving exhibitions of ceiling-walking. He had brought back with him
                    enough money to satisfy all his needs, and he was now devoting himself to scientific and mechanical
                    research. Edward and I were accustomed to spend many hours in this queerly constituted
                    person&apos;s workshop, sometimes helping him in his work, sometimes <pb id="VAA2342-245" n="[]"/>

                    sometimes merely listening to McCormack&apos;s talk. Among other things he had a complete series
                    of <hi rend="i">Indiana</hi> rock specimens, each carefully dressed in such fashion as best to show
                    its formation and structure. &quot;I think God made these rocks,&quot; he said to us one
                    day. &quot;Some people don&apos;t seem to think so. Anyhow, it can do you boys no harm to
                    find out how they were made.&quot;</p>
                <p>Then we got out our hammers and went geologizing again, and one day, as we stood together in the
                    Great Rock railroad cut, Edward said:</p>
                <p>&quot;Geordie, I can&apos;t help thinking we do right to study this. Anyhow, the rocks
                    haven&apos;t any interest to tell us lies.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;And they make no mistakes,&quot; I an-swered.</p>
                <p>&quot;No; but we may make mistakes in interpreting them,&quot; he said.</p>
                <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think that ought to stand in <pb id="VAA2342-247" n="240"/> our
                    way,&quot; I replied. &quot;If we are so afraid of misunderstanding that we dare not try to
                    understand at allwell, Edward, the fact seems to me to be this: some people who know very little
                    have set themselves up as knowing&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Please, Geordie, don&apos;t! That thought has been trying to undermine my faith, and it
                    has very nearly succeeded.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Your faith in what? &quot;I asked.&quot; Surely your faith in God needn&apos;t
                    suffer because you suspect incapacity on the part of those who perhaps unwarrantably assume to be
                    his authorized interpreters.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward made no answer then. Forty years later he picked up a trilobite one day, and said to me:</p>
                <p>&quot;Do you remember how hard it once was for me to distinguish between truth and the teachings
                    that assumed authority between the teachings of God and those of men who professed to know his ways
                    and his purposes?&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-248" n="241"/>
                <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered. &quot;I remember. You then called atrilobite an antediluvian
                    creature. You would hardly give the Noah&apos;s ark story that much credit now.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;No,&quot; he answered, &quot;and yet ninetenths of the American people believe that
                    story even now, nine-tenths of them believe in miracles, and really suppose that the world is only
                    six thousand years old, that Adam and Eve were historical personages and all the rest of it. It will
                    be a hundred years and more before the average American citizen finds out even those things that are
                    the commonplaces of thought to all educated men. Only the other day I read a very labored book,
                    whose author, a devout Kentucky clergyman, sought to prove that negroes are pre-Adamites and have no
                    souls.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;He sent it to you?&quot; I asked.</p>
                <p>&quot;Yes, with a request for my opinion, as usual.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;What did you say to him?&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;I said I thought he must be right in <pb id="VAA2342-249" n="242"/> believing that negroes
                    have no souls, inasmuch as there is absolutely no reason to think that negroes have any advantage
                    over white men in that respect.&quot;</p>
                <p>In tracing the influences that helped to develop the mind of a man like Edward Eggleston, it seems to
                    me equally a duty to set forth those influences that stood in the way. It is for this reason that
                    parts of this chapter are written.</p>

                <head type="subtitle">The Hoosier Schoolmaster&apos;s Theory and<lb/> Practice of Teaching.</head>
                <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> is a curious fact that the author of &quot;The Hoosier
                    Schoolmaster&quot; was never a schoolmaster at all. About the time of which these chapters
                    treat, Edward Eggleston did indeed apply for a first-class teacher&apos;s license under the
                    Indiana school laws. He easily passed the examination, secured the license and was appointed to the
                    principalship of a school in the suburbs of Madison. Then he set himself to work on Greek and within
                    two weeks had so broken down his health by overstudy that he was obliged to resign his appointment
                    and go off again in search of health.</p>
                <p>That, I believe, was his only experience in teaching, at least in any formal way. But he was always a
                    teacher and a source of inspiration. <pb id="VAA2342-251" n="244"/> One of his pupils at that
                    school, who is now a person of prominence, said to me at the Authors Club, not long ago, pointing to
                    Edward&apos;s portrait by Wiles:</p>
                <p>&quot;That man taught me how to study, and, better still, why to study. To him I owe it that I am
                    educated.&quot;</p>
                <p>I shall never forget how he followed up my Latin preparation for college.</p>
                <p>&quot;Now Geordie,&quot; he said, &quot;they reckon Greek a lame duck, and they make
                    provision for it. But it is a lame duck sort of provision, and I don&apos;t want you to have
                    anything to do with it. They have a preparatory Greek course, under an adjunct professor. He gives
                    you a part of a paradigm to learn each daythe present tense of the indicative mood to-day, and the
                    imperfect to-morrow. Don&apos;t have anything to do with that class. Simply say you will be
                    prepared in two weeks to pass your entrance examinations in Greek, and then set to work to prepare
                    yourself precisely as you have done in Latin. Remember <pb id="VAA2342-252" n="245"/> that a mastery
                    of the paradigms is everything. Find some fellow just as lame in Greek as you are and get him to
                    join you. If it costs you more by a dollar or two a week to room with him, don&apos;t let that
                    stand in the way. I am earning that much as a grocery clerk, and I&apos;ll pay the difference.
                    You and he should shut yourselves up in your room during every hour that college requirements leave
                    free, and continually prod each other with Greek conjugations. The &apos; lesson&apos;
                    prescribed by the professor for the first day will be the present, active, indicative of Tupto.
                    Instead of that you must both of you learn the whole conjugation of that verb before you go to your
                    breakfast sausages, and then, before you present yourselves at your first lecture, you must
                    perfectly know how to conjugate the irregular verb erkomai from start to finish. If you and your
                    workfellow work half as well in your Greek as you have done with me in Latin, before the two weeks
                    are over you&apos;ll <pb id="VAA2342-253" n="246"/> know how to decline every Greek noun and
                    adjective and how to conjugate every regular and nearly every irregular Greek verb, and in doing
                    that you&apos;ll acquire vocabulary enough to enable you not only to pass your entrance
                    examinations without any thanks to your adjunct professor&apos;s laborious teachings, but to
                    take the lead in your class. But one thing more I want you and that other fellow to do. I have
                    written out a vocabulary for you to learn. It includes between 300 and 400 words, with their primary
                    meanings. I want you to commit it absolutely to memory, so that whenever and wherever any one of
                    those words may occur you&apos;ll know what it meansin a general way at least.&quot;</p>
                <p>I had not dreamed that Edward knew so much of Greek. He had never had a lesson in that language in
                    his life, but I found his method of study the very best I ever knew. Afterwards, when it became
                    necessary for me to earn my own college expenses by tutoring some boys during vacation, <pb
                        id="VAA2342-254" n="247"/> for their entrance examinations, I followed the same plan with
                    satisfactory results. I gravely wonder to-day that no teacher in our secondary schools has ever hit
                    upon a like method. Perhaps other and more conventional methods are easier to the teacher as they
                    certainly are to the pupil who doesn&apos;t want to study very hard. Perhaps well it
                    doesn&apos;t matter. I only know that by the methods devised by the mainly self-educated boy,
                    Edward Eggleston, I learned in eight days to read simple Latin at sight, and in two weeks to read
                    easy Greek in the same way, to conjugate nearly every verb, regular and irregular, to decline every
                    noun and adjective, and to turn simple English sentences into approximately correct Greek, almost
                    without effort.</p>
                <p>I sometimes wonder if there ought not to be a divine call to teach, as there is supposed to be a
                    divine call to preach. Certainly Edward Eggleston, at the age of less than eighteen, knew better how
                    to teach</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-255" n="248"/>
                <p>Latin and Greek than do the most skilful teachers in our most pretentious preparatory schools to-day.
                    Our boys spend several years, at an expense of half a thousand dollars a year, in learning what
                    Edward Eggleston, while still under eighteen years of age, taught in a week or two to a not
                    exceptionally bright pupil.</p>
                <p>Let me record it here as my well-considered conviction, that if there were any means of selection
                    among the pupils of our great preparatory schools, one year&apos;s tuition would be ample,
                    instead of the four years now given to High School work, to prepare the best quarter of their number
                    for college or for the undertaking of professional study. Our schools are at present organized on
                    the basis of the capacity and the willingness of the duller three-fourths. That other fourth the one
                    that is alone really worth considering, the one that is alone worthy to enter college or a
                    professional schoolis crippled and practiced in indolence from beginning to <pb id="VAA2342-256"
                        n="249"/> end, by having the incapacities of its duller classmates set up as the standard and
                    measure of its achievement. Why isn&apos;t there a school in all our land in which a really
                    bright and earnest boy can prepare himself for college or for professional study in one year instead
                    of four? And why isn&apos;t there a college in which a boy of real capacity is permitted to
                    master the four years&apos; course in one year or two, as any boy of real capacity and industry
                    easily might?</p>
                <p>The fundamental defect lies in tradition, but it is reflected also in the teaching. To the youth who
                    is really taught the higher algebra, all the rest of mathematics follows as a matter of course; and
                    a few weeks, or at most a few months, of competent teaching would enable him to complete that part
                    of his course. To the youth who knows his paradigms and is master of a reasonable vocabulary in
                    Greek or Latin, a very few months at most should suffice for all needed preparation for final
                    examinations.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-257" n="250"/>
                <p>Unhappily our educational system is founded upon different conceptions. Our courses of study arc
                    marked out for the duller rather than the brighter pupils. They are arranged with far greater
                    reference to the ease and comfort than to the earnest work of professors and tutors.</p>
                <p>Is there any profession in the world in which men do so little for their money as in that of
                    teaching? The schoolmaster gives five or six hours a day to his work during five days in the weeka
                    total of 25 or 30 hours a week. What other profession lets one off so easily? Then, too, the
                    schoolmaster has a world of holidays that no other professional man enjoys. All his Saturdays and
                    Sundays are his own for rest. Labor day, election day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year&apos;s,
                    Washington&apos;s birthday, Lincoln&apos;s birthday, Decoration day and the Fourth of July
                    are free days to him. In addition, he has a vacation at Christmas, another at Easter, and one of
                    three months <pb id="VAA2342-258" n="251"/> or longer in the summer. What lawyer, doctor, clergyman,
                    newspaper writer or man of letters, commands or expects such leisure? And it is all paid for by the
                    parents of boys and girls who must be educated. If teachers would work as continuously, as
                    industriously, and as intelligently as men of all other professions do and must do, the academic
                    course could be completely mastered within a year, or two years at most, and a year or a year and a
                    half of earnest work would amply suffice for the mastery of any college curriculum appointed in this
                    country.</p>
                <p>This is saying nothing whatever with respect to the needless and time-wasteful expansion of the
                    curriculum. Granting that everything required is desirableand it is a large grantingan earnest
                    student under an earnest teacher ought to master the school course in two years at most, and the
                    college course in two years more. A really bright boy, if his teacher knows how to teach, should be
                    able to do it within half that time.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-259" n="252"/>
                <p>Daniel Webster was graduated from college at 19 years of age; Edward Everett at 17, and the other
                    great men of our land at about the same age. To-day the requirements are such that the student who
                    enters college must be a year or two older than these men were when they left it with their degrees.
                    Is this an advance in education or the reverse a gain or a loss? Is it desirable that the boy shall
                    spend the first twenty-five years of his life in preparation for a problematical twenty-five years
                    more of activity? Are we not making a fetich of mere scholarship? Are we not giving an excessive
                    period of youth to mere acquirement, both by wasting the time appointed for acquirement, and by
                    exacting a needless amount of acquirement? Bearing in mind the facts that life is short and that the
                    object of education is so to train the mind as to get its best results in active ways, is not our
                    entire educational system wrong at both ends? Does it not require more of mere acquirement than is
                        <pb id="VAA2342-260" n="253"/> actually needful, and does not the indolence of teachers exact a
                    larger expenditure of time than is really necessary for such acquirement?</p>
                <p>These are questions which we must seriously think about if we really care for the future of our
                    country and of mankind. There is a professional impulse on the part of those who teach, to exact
                    more and more of those who learn. It is a natural impulse, and, properly directed, a wholesome one.
                    But is it not capable of abuse, and is it not in fact abused? Is not mere scholarship unduly exalted
                    in our time, and does not achievement pay the penalty? Was not a Daniel Webster graduated at 19, an
                    Edward Everett at 17, worth more to the world than Daniel Webster and Edward Everett graduated at
                    twenty-five with vastly more of mere learning, would have been?</p>
                <p>For specialists in scholarship of course there can be no limit set to needful acquirements; but for
                    the men who are to do the <pb id="VAA2342-261" n="254"/> world&apos;s great work in one or
                    another department of active endeavor, it seems easily possible to exact too much, and to waste
                    needless years in preparation that does not prepare. Still more obvious is it that diligence in
                    teaching and the use of enlightened methods might greatly shorten the period of preparation, no
                    matter what the requirements may be.</p>

                <head type="subtitle">A Pair of Young Tramps.</head>
                <p>D<hi rend="sc">URING</hi> this time, after Edward&apos;s return from Virginia, he and I began, or
                    rather resumed, a course of tramping that had a most beneficial effect upon his health.</p>
                <p>Before and after he &quot;chucked me into college,&quot; as he boyishly described the
                    performance, we accustomed ourselves, in my vacation times, to prolonged walks, sometimes extending
                    over several weeks of time. If there was anything to be seen, anywhere within pedestrian reach, we
                    went to see it, adopting the most primitive travel methods, and enduring very cheerfully all the
                    hardships incident to such methods. We slept in hay mows, or under straw stacks, or, upon occasion,
                    in fence corners. We sometimes got a breakfast or a dinner at some hospitable <pb id="VAA2342-263"
                        n="256"/> farmer&apos;s house, where our tender of money in paymentfor we always carried a
                    little money and never failed to offer pay for our food and lodgingwas usually rejected with that
                    scorn which the Western farmer at that time felt for the man who would &quot;charge&quot;
                    for a meal or a night&apos;s lodging. In the main, however, we ate corn bread and bacon from our
                    pockets.</p>
                <p>On these journeys Edward reduced everything to system, after his habitual manner. He had a big
                    bull&apos;s-eye silver watch, which kept good enough time for all our purposes, and by it he
                    regulated our trampings. We would set out in the morning to cover a prescribed distance. Edward
                    would mark off the miles into relays and estimate very carefully how long it should take us to cover
                    each subdivision of the distance. It was his usual practice to reduce our periods of walking to
                    fifteen minutes each, with one minute&apos;s rest at the end of each quarter hour, and three
                    minutes&apos; rest at the end of <pb id="VAA2342-264" n="257"/> each hour. But country miles are
                    apt to be erratic in their length, and so sometimes we were delayed much longer on our road than we
                    had expected, while sometimes instead we would arrive at our destination some hours earlier than we
                    had planned. These things were never suffered to interfere with our program. If we got to our
                    night&apos;s destination before the time appointed that meant an extra period of rest. If we
                    were half an hour or an hour late, we accepted that as proof that the country people had mistaken
                    the length of their miles. In either case we were a happy and contented pair of boys.</p>
                <p>About that time Bayard Taylor published in a newspaper a series of articles concerning the Mammoth
                    Cave in Kentucky, which he had recently visited. I don&apos;t know how we happened to get hold
                    of those fascinating papers, but we did so, and straightway the impulse seized us to visit that
                    wonder of nature.</p>
                <p>With three or four pounds of bacon and <pb id="VAA2342-265" n="258"/> two pones of corn-bread to the
                    good, we set out on our journey. A few miles below Madison we got two fence rails, attached our
                    clothing to the further ends of them, and swam the river. That night we slept in a barn. The next
                    morning we were arrested, charged with aiding or planning to aid in the escape of a runaway negro
                    who had disappeared, but of whose existence we had never heard. As the negro was presently found in
                    a barn in a state of helpless intoxication, we boys were promptly discharged, but with a warning
                    that Hoosierswere not wanted south of the river. A boat was placed at our service, in which we
                    recrossed the stream, and after that we walked back to Madison, compelled to take Bayard
                    Taylor&apos;s word for the existence of the Mammoth Cave, and for all its wonders.</p>
                <p>But, in brooding over the matter, I became dissatisfied with this solution of the problem. I do not
                    think I cared particularly for the Mammoth Cave, but it was my habit <pb id="VAA2342-266" n="259"/>
                    of mind to resent and resist any balking of my purposes, whatever they might be, by the arbitrary
                    will of others. It seemed to me that to go to the Mammoth Cave had become an imperative duty which
                    Edward and I owed to our own self-respect. I happened to know that a well-to-do neighbor of ours was
                    just then getting in his year&apos;s supply of wood, so early in the morning I went to him and
                    took the contract to saw, split and cord up his wood for a certain price per cord. I had sawed and
                    split and corded wood all my life as a contribution of service to the domestic economy of our
                    household, but never before had I done so for money. I was gravely apprehensive that if the present
                    state of facts should become known in the family some form of prohibition would be interposed. So I
                    kept the matter secret. By this and some other work that I secured, and by the sale of such school
                    text-books as I had done with, I secured, altogether, the sum of six dollars and seventy-five cents.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-267" n="260"/>
                <p>With so much money in hand, I went to Edward and announced that he and I were going upon our
                    contemplated travels. Fifty cents apiece paid our deck passage to Louisville on a steamboat. There
                    we bought crackers, smoked herrings and cheese, and, thus provisioned, we set out to walk the few
                    miles that lay between the city and the cave.</p>
                <p>The great cavern was a disappointment to us. Perhaps we lacked something of that creative imagination
                    with which Bayard Taylor had seen and described it. At any rate, we felt rather ill-repaid for our
                    journey, particularly as Edward managed to lose the remainder of our money before we got back to
                    Louisville, so that we had to tramp the extra fifty miles or so of our homeward journey from that
                    city to Madison.</p>
                <p>All this occurred before the time when Edward undertook to prepare me for my college examinations. It
                    is related here as a part of what the lawyers call the <hi rend="i">res gesti</hi> of Edward
                    Eggleston&apos;s youth.</p>

                <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the spring of 1856 Edward&apos;s health broke down completely. He had
                    hemorrhages, supposed to be from the lungs, and the decision of the doctors was that he was doomed
                    to die presently of consumption.</p>
                <p>Our mother took him on a voyage to St. Louisin the hope that the journey might restore his health. It
                    did nothing to promise recovery or even betterment, but on the way the boy fell in with a number of
                    other people afflicted as he was, who were going to Minnesotaat that time the new land of promise
                    for consumptives.</p>
                <p>He made up his mind to go thither also. Our mother could barely and with difficulty furnish him with
                    passage money up the river, but he bravely undertook to look out for <pb id="VAA2342-269" n="262"/>
                    himself after he should land in Minnesota, and, with very little hope for health, as he wrote me at
                    the time, he set out.</p>
                <p>He used to relate that on the way up the river the captain of his steamboat, who was commodore of the
                    line, took sufficient interest in him to give him advice.</p>
                <p>&quot;Now, some o&apos; these fellers,&quot; he said, &quot;has got only a little
                    o&apos; your trouble, an&apos; mebbe the climate o&apos; Minnesota will help
                    &apos;em to live on for a few months or a year or so. But you&apos;ve got it too bad for
                    that. Take a fool&apos;s advice an&apos; go right back home, so&apos;s you can pick out
                    the place you want to be buried in. If you ain&apos;t got money enough for that, I kin arrange
                    for passes. But the one thing fer you to do is to go home jest as quick as you kin.&quot;</p>
                <p>Years afterward Edward had occasion to travel frequently on this old captain&apos;s steamboat and
                    the two became devoted friends the one being a Methodist preacher and the other a bluff steamboat
                    man who, for lack <pb id="VAA2342-270" n="263"/> of an adequate supply of other adjectives,
                    sprinkled an entirely meaningless profanity through his sentences. Edward, throughout his life
                    objected, on principle, to all &quot;deadheading&quot; of the clergy, and to all
                    &quot;discounts&quot; made to preachers on the ground of their calling. He insisted that
                    these practices constituted a pauperizing of the clergy, and would himself have none of it. He even
                    wrote humorously on the subject years afterward in the <hi rend="i">Century Magazine</hi>,
                    ridiculing such &quot;dead-heading&quot; with caustic contempt, and insisting that a
                    clergyman owed it to his own self-respect to pay his way like any other citizen. But he never
                    succeeded in paying his passage on any boat of the line which this old captain owned and controlled.
                    When he raised the point of principle in a controversy over the matter one day, the captain replied:</p>
                <p>&quot;Well, now, it&apos;s been my rule all my life never to charge fare to a corpse,
                    an&apos; you&apos;re a corpse, though you don&apos;t look like <pb id="VAA2342-271"
                        n="201"/> one. The first time you traveled with me I tole you you hadn&apos;t
                    more&apos;n a month to live. Well, that month&apos;s gone many a month ago, an&apos; so
                    you&apos;re dead or else I&apos;m a liar, an&apos; I never yet allowed even a preacher
                    to call me that. You can&apos;t never pay no fare on no steamboat that I own without
                    callin&apos; me a liar, so that&apos;s the end of that.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;And think of it,&quot; Edward said to me one day long after the old captain had been
                    gathered to his fathers, &quot;at that time I was deeply apprehensive for the future welfare of
                    that dear old man&apos;s soul, just as if God didn&apos;t know what stuff men are made
                    of.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward landed in Minnesotathen a new territory just beginning its settlement in May, 1856. He was a
                    mere boy of 18 years. He was absolutely without acquaintance there and absolutely penniless. In the
                    search for bread-winning work he must match his frail physique against the robustness of hundreds of
                    stalwart youths who had gone west to conquer fortunes for themselves. <pb id="VAA2342-272" n="265"/>
                    The contest was an unequal one, but the frail boy&apos;s &quot;grit&quot; stood him in
                    good stead, and its recognition on the part of the gloriously brave &quot;frontier
                    conquerors,&quot; as he loved to call them, was ready and generous.</p>
                <p>He did whatever work there was to do. He became chain carrier to a surveying party, and with his
                    readiness in learning, he quickly picked up a knowledge of the art and science of surveying, which
                    later enabled him to take command of a surveying party on his own account. But, his health failing
                    again, he had to abandon that employment and go to bed for a time.</p>
                <p>At one time he became the driver of three yoke of oxen hitched to a prairie breaking plow. At another
                    time he took the agency for a soap-making recipe and peddled it over the county. When taunted with
                    this experience in after and more distinguished years his reply was ready:</p>
                <p>&quot;It was the best soap recipe I ever saw, <pb id="VAA2342-273" n="266"/> and soap was a good
                    deal needed in that country. I am prouder of my soap recipe selling than I am of my preaching there;
                    for the soap was above criticism, while the sermons certainly were not.&quot;</p>
                <p>He engaged in other occupations also, by way of earning a living, both at this time of his first stay
                    in the far northwest, and during his later career as a preacher there, when frequently failing
                    health obliged him, now and again, to give up his pastorates and engage in other work. Of these
                    occupations he used afterwards to say: &quot;Some of them may have been undignified, but they
                    were all honestand they brought me a living when I had need of it.&quot;</p>
                <p>Was it not in that spirit that this great, free nation of ours was built up in a wilderness in which
                    the gospel of work played a larger part than any more abstruse teaching could have done?</p>
                <p>After a few months of outdoor life, the boy&apos;s health was so far improved that he <pb

                    <pb id="VAA2342-275" n="267"/> determined to return to his home and resume his studies with a view
                    to that ministry of the gospel to which he looked forward as his appointed career. He had earned
                    enough by hard work on the prairies to feed and clothe himself there, but he had no surplus money
                    with which to pay his way home. So he wrote to me, asking me to send him thirty dollars out of his
                    share in our slender estate.</p>
                <p>I sent him the money by express, in the form of thirty silver dollars.</p>
                <p>But mails were slow in those days, and his letter had been long in coming. A day or two after I had
                    sent off the money Edward himself appearedtravel worn but in better health than I had ever seen him.</p>
                <p>He had a stirring story to tell. After writing me the letter asking for money for his home-coming, he
                    had been seized with a sudden enthusiasm to bear a part in behalf of freedom in the bloody struggle
                    then going on in Kansas. So, without waiting to <pb id="VAA2342-276" n="208"/> receive the money for
                    which he had written to me, he had strapped a knapsack upon his back and set out to walk from
                    Minnesota to Kansas. His path being hopelessly blocked in Iowa, he turned about and decided to make
                    his way homeward, well-nigh penniless and on foot, across a country which at that time was almost
                    wholly without inhabitants. For three hundred and sixty-five miles he traveled across desert wastes,
                    living upon such food as he could here and there find, sleeping upon the prairie under the stars and
                    among the wolves, and often going without water for more than a day at a time.</p>
                <p>Finally, he had reached a railroad, and found that by the expenditure of two dollars more than he had
                    in possession he could pay his fare to Lafayette, Indiana, where a step brother lived. Not having
                    the two dollars he laid the case before an entire stranger, of a disposition so kindly that he
                    willingly advanced the money. To return it promptly was Edward&apos;s first concern on <pb
                        id="VAA2342-277" n="269"/> reaching home, and in aid of that purpose I undertook to tutor a
                    stupid and rather disagreeable boy through his coming first term in college, taking him as my
                    room-mate in spite of his disagreeableness, on condition that he would make advance payment of the
                    two dollars which alone I was to get for seeing to it that he should pass his examinations at the
                    end of the next and now approaching term. We had relatives in the town who would gladly have
                    furnished the money, or it might somehow have been squeezed out of the sadly embarrassed estate, but
                    I preferred to secure it by my own exertions, as an expression of my joy in having my brother back
                    again as my comrade.</p>
                <p>The comradeship was not to be for long. I must almost immediately return to college, and Edward was
                    fixed in his determination to secure a preacher&apos;s license and begin his career as a
                    Methodist circuit rider. Until this time he had cherished the hope of taking a college course, but
                    repeated experiment <pb id="VAA2342-278" n="270"/> in close application to study had finally
                    convinced him that this was impossible, that he must live in the open air during the greater part of
                    his waking hours, and that whatever of study he might attempt must be done in full recognition of
                    this necessity.</p>
                <p>He was not yet nineteen years old, but his mind was mature far beyond his years, as it always had
                    been. He was already and very greatly the superior in education of most of the young Methodist
                    preachers of that time, and of most of the college graduates, too, for that matter, if in education
                    we include travel, experience, and the educative influence of a varied contact with men. Why, then,
                    should he not begin his work without further delay?</p>
                <p>That question was promptly answered. The church authorities were glad to ordain him, and he was
                    eagerly ready for work. He was assigned to a circuit in extreme southeastern Indiana, as its junior
                    minister, with ten different preaching appointments.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-279" n="271"/>
                <p>For six months he &quot;rode circuit,&quot; spending the greater part of his days on
                    horseback and eating and sleeping wherever he might be invited to eat and sleep among the hill
                    people.</p>
                <p>This life gave him few opportunities for reading or study, for in those days when &quot;the
                    preacher&quot; came to any house it was expected that he should hold prayers with the family,
                    gently lecture and admonish the children, and make himself agreeable as the centre of a local
                    society of which every member was invited to breakfast, dine, sup or spend the evening in his
                    supposedly uplifting company. There was no seclusion, no privacy for him in any house. More than
                    half the time he was expected to occupy the same room and even the same bed with the boys of the
                    family. Nowhere was he free from converse that contributed not at all to his culture or to his
                    intellectual growth. To &quot;entertain the preacher&quot; meant not only to provide him
                    with lodging and meals, but <pb id="VAA2342-280" n="272"/> also to keep his mind continually
                    occupied with an entirely unimproving conversation which consumed his time to no purpose.</p>
                <p>To meet these conditions Edward adopted a plan of his own, of which he wrote to me at college, in
                    gleeful exultation. He had been bred to expert horsemanship from his earliest infancy, and could
                    both ride and control the least tractable of horses. But he wanted time and opportunity for reading
                    and study, so he wrote to me:</p>
                <p>&quot;I have bought a good, strong, and very lazy horse, without enough spirit in him to think of
                    going at any gait faster than a walk unless whipped or spurred into involuntary exertion of a
                    strictly temporary character. The distance between &apos;appointments&apos; is considerable,
                    and with such a horse I have abundant excuse for starting early and arriving late. By taking all day
                    to make journeys that might easily be accomplished in a few hours, I get all day instead of a few
                    hours for my study. I throw the reins on my <pb id="VAA2342-281" n="273"/> horse&apos;s neck and
                    let him jog on at his favorite speed of two or three miles an hour. Then I get out a book and devote
                    my time to profitable reading or study. As I cannot carry my Greek or Latin dictionaries with me, I
                    must do without them. But I find that to be not altogether a disadvantage. It compels me to <hi
                        rend="i">think</hi> for my vocabulary, and to study context in a way that I should never do if I
                    had a dictionary at hand. I have just finished reading the <hi rend="i">Oedipus Tyrannis</hi> in
                    this way, and while the lack of lexicon reference has doubtless cost me some of the niceties of
                    scholarship, I am not sure that the loss hasn&apos;t been more than made good by increased
                    fluency, and by the compulsion of the memory to retain what it has once grasped in the way of word
                    meanings. Sometimes I encounter a word the meaning of which I cannot in anywise make out. But
                    presently I encounter it again in a different connection, where the context serves instead of a
                    dictionary. Then I go back to the former <pb id="VAA2342-282" n="274"/> passage and read it in the
                    new light. I wonder if it might not be possible to teach at least the dead languages in that way,
                    after the declensions and conjugations were learned. And I am not sure that it wouldn&apos;t be
                    the best way in the end, at least so far as intellectual discipline is concerned.&quot;</p>
                <p>He himself afterward applied this method to the learning of other languages with conspicuous success.
                    Knowing his Greek, Latin and French pretty well to begin with, he decided in his own mind that
                    whenever he should have need to read any passage in any language, he could and would do it; and to
                    the end of his days he did precisely that, often to the great advantage of his studies in historical
                    research.</p>
                <p>But at this time of his early circuit riding, he did not confine himself wholly or even chiefly to
                    scholarly study. He read voluminously, mainly in lines that were suggested by his profession. He
                    read Wesley and Whitfield and Thomas a Kempis. But he found <pb id="VAA2342-283" n="275"/> time also
                    to read a world of history and biographyparticularly biography which, he always contended, was
                    &quot;history cut in thick slices.&quot; He read everything, in fact, upon which his
                    preternaturally eager mind could lay hands, and, youth-like, he was specially attracted to poetry of
                    an uplifting sort. Such poetry he sometimes used in his sermons, as he did also the more inspiring
                    passages of Scripture.</p>
                <p>&quot;The practice is dangerous, however,&quot; he wrote to me, &quot;in this hill
                    country. Not long ago I quoted a part of the twenty-third Psalm, not thinking it necessary to
                    mention its source. A few days later a good brother said to me: &apos;That was a mighty pretty
                    part of your sermon about green pastures and still waters and all that. But why don&apos;t you
                    preach that way all the time?&apos; Alas, I had not only made myself a plagiarist of King David,
                    but had set up the choicest utterances of the sweet singer of Israel as a standard of rhetoric for
                    myself.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-284" n="276"/>
                <p>Notwithstanding the out of door life of a circuit rider, Edward studied himself into illness again
                    within six months and had to abandon the work. After a few months of rest at home, he turned his
                    face again toward Minnesota, where alone, since his infancy, he had enjoyed that measure of health
                    which permits a man to take his working part in life.</p>

                <head type="subtitle">The Story of &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster.&quot;</head>
                <p>B<hi rend="sc">ETWEEN</hi> the time of Edward&apos;s return from his first stay in Minnesota and
                    that of his second journey thither, I had some experiences of my own which mightily interested and
                    amused my brother. These experiences are to be very briefly related here, partly because they
                    reflect what still survived of the &quot;Hoosier&quot; life in the hill country, very near
                    to the higher civilization along the river, but still more because Edward&apos;s amused
                    recollection of what I told him about them at the time, prompted him many years afterwards to write
                    &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster.&quot;</p>
                <p>Soon after the beginning of my second year in college a controversy arose between the faculty and the
                    student body, in which I thought then and I think now that the students <pb id="VAA2342-286" n="278"
                    /> were absolutely right and the faculty altogether wrong. But the faculty were in authority and
                    threatened the suspension of all the students, with expulsion quickly to follow, if we should
                    persist in our refusal to accept the harsh and wholly unjust terms offered to us. We persisted and
                    all of us, except forty-one who submitted at the last moment, were sent home. In justice to the
                    students thus dismissed, many of whom have since won high places for themselves as men of character
                    and brains, it should be stated here that the Board of Trustees, after hearing both sides of the
                    matter, decided that the students were right, and ordered their readmission to their classes without
                    conditions of any kind. At the same time the Board asked the president and certain members of the
                    faculty for their resignations.</p>
                <p>I did not avail myself of the reinstatement, for the reason that I had, in the meanwhile, accepted
                    charge of a school on Riker&apos;s <pb id="VAA2342-287" n="279"/> Ridge, a few miles from
                    Madison, in the hill country. The neighborhood was at that time the most primitive one in all that
                    region, though it lay so close to the chief city of southern Indiana. The people there were partly
                    Pennsylvania Dutch, partly Hoosiers. They were very good and kindly people, as I remember them, but
                    scantily educated and still somewhat disposed to cling to the old school tradition of &quot;no
                    lickin&apos; no larnin&apos;,&quot; which is emphasized as an axiom in &quot;The
                    Hoosier Schoolmaster.&quot; The advent, therefore, of a schoolmaster still under seventeen years
                    of age, to manage a school in which the majority of the pupils were his seniors, was looked upon
                    with doubt and well-founded apprehension. The fact that I was a college student, and that my
                    education was vastly superior to that of any one in the neighborhood, was readily recognized.</p>
                <p>&quot;But how&apos;s that boy ever agoin&apos; to manage sich a school as ours?&quot;
                    they asked.</p>
                <p>&quot;Why, they&apos;s a dozen boys in that <pb id="VAA2342-288" n="280"/> school any one of
                    &apos;em able to lick him with their right hands tied behind &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                <p>That was true enough. It was true, also, that one of the big boys had won distinction by
                    &quot;licking&quot; the last three masters. He was the original of Bud Means in
                    &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster,&quot; though rather gentler of disposition than Bud was.
                    Still he had always cherished the conviction that the schoolmaster is the natural enemy of the big
                    boy, an enemy to be &quot;licked&quot; upon the smallest provocation. It was confidently
                    predicted, therefore, by the trustees of the school, and by the school itself, and by all the
                    neighbors, that &quot;school won&apos;t be a week old before Charley Gwill give the master a
                    lickin&apos;.&quot;</p>
                <p>Curiously enough it was only through Charley G&apos;s willing assistance that I was able to
                    govern the unruly school at all. Charley was a young man of twenty-one, six feet high, and as
                    powerful almost as a young bull, which animal indeed he resembled in <pb id="VAA2342-289" n="281"/>
                    perfect symmetry of form and perfect command of his muscles. He was not only able to
                    &quot;lick&quot; me or any other master that the school might get; he could
                    &quot;lick&quot; any boy in the school with no apparent effort whatever, and every boy there
                    knew the fact, some of them by bitter experience.</p>
                <p>But Charley was two years older now than he had been when he drove the last schoolmaster out of the
                    neighborhood. Manhood had come to him, and with it ambition. He had decided to become a ship
                    carpenter, and in his preliminary investigations regarding the opportunities that trade offered to a
                    young man engaging in it, he had shrewdly observed two facts: first, that the men who became
                    &quot;boss&quot; ship carpenters, or even subbosses, were only those who had learned certain
                    mathematics that lay far beyond the arithmetic; secondly, that sub-bosses were paid twice or thrice
                    the wages of ordinary hands, while boss ship carpenters usually grew well-to-do and lived in fine
                    houses.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-290" n="282"/>
                <p>So, when the boy-master came to the schoolthe first master he had ever had who could teach algebra,
                    geometry and trigonometry, the ambitious young man felt that his opportunity had come. He came to me
                    by nightor rather asked me to go to him after the first day of schoolduring which, as he afterwards
                    told me, he had carefully &quot;sized me up&quot; as to good fellowship and teaching
                    capacityand laid his ambitions before me. He told me what mathematics he must learn in order to
                    equip himself for his chosen career, and asked me, with eyes eagerly scanning mine for the real
                    answer, whether I thought it possible for him to master so much during the months for which I had
                    been appointed to the school.</p>
                <p>I asked in return how much he knew of arithmetic which, I explained to him, was the foundation of the
                    mathematical superstructure he wished to build. For answer he said simply:</p>
                <p>&quot;Try me, and find out for yourself.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-291" n="283"/>
                <p>It was ten o&apos;clock at night, and I was, by invitation, staying over night in his
                    father&apos;s house, where nine o&apos;clock was the customary bedtime for everybody. So I
                    answered:</p>
                <p>&quot;I&apos;ll examine you in arithmetic to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;No, do it now, please,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m ready for all night and I
                    can&apos;t sleep till I know about it. You see the old man gives me this six months of
                    schooling, and he&apos;ll never give me any more. So I want to know, just as quick as possible,
                    what I can do.&quot;</p>
                <p>Seeing the young man&apos;s eagerness for education, and sympathizing with it, I set to work at
                    once to test his knowledge of arithmetic. Before midnight I told him he was prepared to go forward,
                    and added:</p>
                <p>&quot;I can teach you all you need of algebra, geometry and trigonometry, within the next six
                    months, if you aid me by trying very hard to learn. I&apos;ll gladly do my part. The rest
                    depends upon you.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-292" n="284"/>
                <p>He promised, and that was our compact. Nothing whatever had been said about school government, or the
                    maintenance of order, but I soon learned by observation that Charley Ghad thought out all that. He
                    wanted to learn; I was to teach him; he did not intend that any school trouble should interfere with
                    that program. A day or two later a boy tried to disturb the school by drawing his pencil over his
                    slate so as to make it squeak in a nerve-distressing way. I rebuked him. Presently he did it again,
                    and I again admonished him. Five minutes later he ventured upon a third offence. Before I could
                    decide what to do, Charley Grose quickly, crossed the aisle, seized the offender&apos;s ear and
                    vigorously twisted it till the fellow writhed in pain.</p>
                <p>&quot;You heard the master,&quot; was all he said.</p>
                <p>If a thunderbolt had entered the schoolroom there could not have been greater astonishment. Charley
                    Gon the side of the master! And even helping him maintain <pb id="VAA2342-293" n="285"/> discipline
                    and order! It was unbelievable. But further proof of it came quickly. There was a little fellowthe
                    smallest in the schoolwhose quaint ways were very endearing. His name was Ebenezer Ledgerwood, but
                    he was called &quot;Needy.&quot; There was a hulking, cowardly brute there, whose one
                    employment on the playground seemed to be to persecute the peculiarly inoffensive and lovable child.
                    I inflicted severe punishments of my own devising by way of stopping this brutality of persecution.
                    The more I punished the more the hulking brute persecuted the helpless little fellow.</p>
                <p>Finally, I put aside all my prejudices against corporal punishment, and gave the big fellow a
                    thrashing with a stout gad, promising him a worse one if he should repeat the offence. That day at
                    the noon recess the fellow set to work to &quot;take it out&quot; of Needy Ledgerwood. I was
                    looking and hearing through a window blind. Charley Gwas at the bat in a game of town-ball.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-294" n="286"/>
                <p>He threw down the bat, seized the persecutor, and, seating himself on one of several bundles of
                    shingles that had been left lying around when the new school-house was finished, turned the fellow
                    across his lap, holding him by the nape of his neck and pinioning his legs by throwing one of his
                    own across them. Then he called for shingles, and they were quickly brought by boys who were
                    accustomed to do Charley G&apos;s bidding. These shingles, one after another, he wore out as
                    implements of spanking, until a dozen or more of them were gone. And that the spanking was effective
                    was abundantly proved by the howls of pain it called forth from the victim. Finally, Charley Gstood
                    the fellow up, slapped his jaws with a vigor that suggested the possibility of broken bones, and
                    then releasing him, said:</p>
                <p>&quot;Now take a hint from that. I&apos;ll do you up a great deal wuss next time. And
                    don&apos;t you go whining to the master about <pb id="VAA2342-295" n="287"/> this. If you do,
                    it&apos;ll be a good deal wuss for you. I&apos;m a takin&apos; this here job off the
                    master&apos;s hands.&quot;</p>
                <p>Screened by a Venetian blind, I had seen and heard all that had happened. But I thought it best to
                    let well enough alone, so I gave no sign then or afterwards that I knew anything about it. But I had
                    no further occasion to exercise discipline over the boys of that school. They quite understood that
                    Charley Gwas &quot;a takin&apos; this here job off the master&apos;s hands,&quot;
                    and they ordered their conduct accordingly.</p>
                <p>The girls were my only problem. They, of course, had no fear of Charley G&apos;s big fists, and
                    they were disposed to defy me. In order to govern them I took a leaf out of Mrs. Dumont&apos;s
                    book. I put them on their honor. I explained to them that of course I should never think of
                    punishing a girl. That would be unworthy of my manhood. But I added that I trusted them to behave as
                    girls should who expected to be &quot;ladies&quot; <pb id="VAA2342-296" n="288"/> after a
                    while. I frankly declared that if they should break every rule and disobey every command, my
                    instinct of courtesy toward them, as girls and young women, would forbid me to attempt any sort of
                    control.</p>
                <p>This was a new view to their minds, and for a time they doubted my sincerity. They tested it by
                    disobeying, in small annoying ways, but finding that no angry outbreak on my part followed, they at
                    last settled down to the belief that I meant what I had said, and finding no &quot;fun&quot;
                    in baiting a teacher who had trusted them to do as they pleased, they ceased to trouble me. I think
                    that a sense of honor and a sort of public opinion in the school helped a good deal in securing this
                    result. It was felt to be &quot;mean&quot; to disobey the teacher when he had declared that
                    no punishment of any kind should be meted out to the disobedient, and each girl was conscious of the
                    fact that her schoolmates, boys and girls alike, would so regard her conduct in such a case.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-297" n="289"/>
                <p>Much that was humorous occurred in the conduct of the school, particularly the odd doings and sayings
                    of &quot;Needy&quot; Ledgerwood, who afterwards served Edward as a model in his portraiture
                    of Shocky in &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster.&quot;</p>
                <p>All these things I related to Edward on my weekly visits to Madison, for I usually went home on
                    Friday afternoon and returned on Monday morning in time for school. Sometimes, however, I remained
                    at Riker&apos;s Ridge over Saturday, in order to help Charley G, who was working night and day
                    over his mathematics. He worked so well and with so much intelligence that before the period of my
                    school teaching ended, he had quite fully accomplished his ambition and was ready to enter upon the
                    learning of his trade in full confidence that he knew enough of the mathematics to warrant his hope
                    of some day becoming a master shipwright. I hope he achieved that ambition, though I have never
                    heard. I bear him in friendly <pb id="VAA2342-298" n="290"/> remembrance, not only because of the
                    way in which he helped me to govern an unruly school, but still more because of the sturdy manliness
                    of his character, and the unfaltering friendship he manifested for me.</p>
                <p>Let me skip over the years here in order to show what things of vastly more importance grew out of
                    this school-teacher experience of my own.</p>
                <p>Late in 1871 Edward resigned from the editorship of the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi>, and presently
                    undertook the not very hopeful task of galvanizing a moribund weekly periodical, <hi rend="i">Hearth
                        and Home</hi>, into new life. That paper had been established by the advertising firm of
                    Pettingill &amp; Bates, with Donald G. Mitchell and Harriet Beecher Stowe as its editors, and
                    that most gifted of juvenile writers, Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge, or Mary E. Dodge as she then wrote the
                    name, in charge of the children&apos;s department. The publication had been a failure almost
                    from the beginning, partly perhaps because Mr,</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-299" n="291"/>
                <p>Mitchell and Mrs. Stowe knew little or nothing of the art of editing a newspaper, while Mrs. Dodge,
                    the only one of the trio who had a genius for such work, held a subordinate instead of a controlling
                    position.</p>
                <p>But apart from that <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> was foredoomed to failure because of a
                    misdirected purpose. It was meant to be a country gentleman&apos;s periodical, while at that
                    time there were almost no country gentlemenin the sense in which the term is here usedin America. It
                    addressed itself largely to a class which at that time scarcely at all existed, though it is fairly
                    numerous now the leisure class that amuses itself with expensive horticulture for pleasure only,
                    rejoices in greenhouses and gardens of exotic plants, and dallies with amateur botany in the same
                    spirit in which it indulges a taste for literature by reading the best magazines.</p>
                <p>The mistake was soon made manifest by the failure of the periodical to repay the lavish expenditures
                    of its publishers, and <pb id="VAA2342-300" n="292"/> presently it was sold to Orange, Judd
                    &amp; Co., publishers of the <hi rend="i">American Agriculturist</hi>. Of the original editors
                    only Mrs. Dodge remained in its service, and I think it entirely just to say that it was only the
                    exceeding charm of the children&apos;s department which she made, that had enabled the paper to
                    retain the few thousands of circulation which it had when Edward Eggleston took editorial control of
                    it.</p>
                <p>I was appointed managing editor under him, not by his request, for he detested nepotism, and the
                    appointment was not one that I needed or desired, but by voluntary act of the publishers, who
                    thought my presence as his lieutenant would free his mind of many worries and perhaps in other ways
                    aid him in the difficult task of rescuing the paper from its slough of despond.</p>
                <p>That task was one of very great perplexity. &quot;First of all,&quot; I remember saying to
                    Edward, &quot;we must find out what is the matter with the paper.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-301" n="293"/>
                <p>He quickly answered:</p>
                <p>&quot;Oh, I know what&apos;s the matter. With the exception of Mrs. Dodge&apos;s
                    admirable children&apos;s pages, all that is is wrong. Write that up in your hat, Geordie, for
                    ready reference. We must change everything radically everything but the children&apos;s pages.
                    There is the horticultural department now. It occupies several pages that might be better used in
                    other ways. I want you to kill it, not by a blow, for that would break the hearts of the publishers
                    and shock some subscribers, perhaps, but kill it by slow suffocation. In rearranging the make-up I
                    want you to put that horticultural section between two sections devoted to better things; then I
                    want you to expand each of those two sections so as to squeeze the horticulture more and more each
                    week till nothing is left of it except perhaps a picture of a new rhododendron or chrysanthemum,
                    with a paragraph of descriptive text. In the agricultural department, I wish you would do all you
                    can to <pb id="VAA2342-302" n="294"/> discourage the portraits of plows that now stand for pictures
                    there, and in the household department, please do the like with skillets, frying pans and patent
                    egg-beaters. But all this is a work of negation and elimination. We must do some constructive work
                    at once. We must get some literature for the paper, with good names attached. I&apos;ve already
                    engaged (here he named a number of popular writers) to furnish matter, and you must be constantly on
                    the lookout for others. You must get some good, interesting descriptive articles that will lend them
                    selves to really artistic illustration, and then you must yourself select the artists to illustrate
                    them. The art superintendentwell, never mind that, choose the artists yourself.</p>
                <p>&quot;Now another thing. We are going to print some stories in this paper, and I want you to get
                    some good onessingle number, short stories mainly, but if you strike a really good three-number
                    story, take it. There&apos;ll be a howl from the publishing office, of <pb id="VAA2342-303"

                    <pb id="VAA2342-304" n="295"/> course, because one of the publishers has always taken &apos;high
                    moral ground&apos;or high immoral ground, whichever it isagainst all novels and stories. Of
                    course we must put stories into the paper, not only for the sake of its success, but because the
                    story is the most effective of all literary forms in teaching truth, conveying interesting
                    information and uplifting men&apos;s minds and souls. I sometimes think the day is coming when
                    pretty nearly all of instruction and all of inspiring thought will be given in the story form, as
                    they once were in the form of verse. Anyhow, we must have some good short stories at once, and
                    presently perhaps we shall print a novel as a serial.&quot;</p>
                <p>It will scarcely be believed of many in the early years of the twentieth century, that so late as the
                    end of the third quarter of the nineteenth, there still survived a bitter prejudice against novels
                    as demoralizing literature, and that even short stories were looked upon with doubt and suspicion.
                    Yet even in 1902thirty <pb id="VAA2342-305" n="296"/> years after that timea very distinguished
                    clergyman in New Jersey, within half an hour&apos;s ride of New York, was bitterly assailed by
                    members of his church, who sought his removal from the pastorate for the sole offence of having done
                    some noble literary work, including a novel or two. The case made such a stir that the metropolitan
                    newspapers gave columns to an account of it, and to the discussion of it which followed.</p>
                <p>To us who were grown men in the early seventies, the lapse of time seems very short between those
                    years and these, but in fact it covers about a third of a century of constant intellectual
                    broadening. If there still are some in the twentieth century who deem novel writing a grave breach
                    of clerical ethics, shall we feel wonder that thirty odd years ago there were many who frowned upon
                    fiction as a thing of immoral tendency, while a little earlier still, novel reading was earnestly
                    denounced from many pulpits, and <pb id="VAA2342-306" n="297"/> usually classed with
                    Sabbath-breaking and sometimes even with blasphemy?</p>
                <p>It was only a few weeks later, and while we were still wrestling with the problem of how to lift <hi
                        rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> out of the mire of stagnation, when one evening about ten
                    o&apos;clock, Edward came to my house full of enthusiasm over a project he had formed.</p>
                <p>&quot;Geordie,&quot; he began at once, &quot;I am going to write a three-number story,
                    founded upon your experiences at Riker&apos;s Ridge, and call it &apos;The Hoosier
                    Schoolmaster.&apos;&quot;</p>
                <p>Then he set forth his theory of art that the artist, whether with pen or brush, who would do his best
                    work, must choose his subjects from the life that he knows. He cited the Dutch painters, and
                    justified his choice of what seemed an unliterary theme, involving rude characters and a strange
                    dialect perversion, by reference to Lowell&apos;s success with the Biglow papers.</p>
                <p>He had no notion, at the outset, of making more than a three-number story of <pb id="VAA2342-307"
                        n="298"/> &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster,&quot; and he wrote the first instalment of it
                    with very little, if any, notion of what was to follow. But that first instalment achieved instant
                    and astonishing success. I think I never knew a piece of work to be so quickly talked about.
                    Newsstand sales increased at once, and new subscriptions began to burden every mail. Many newspapers
                    in the West asked and secured permission to copy the story, publishing each instalment two weeks
                    after its appearance in <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi>. It was deemed good advertising policy to
                    give such permission freely, and it proved to be so.</p>
                <p>Before writing the second instalment the author changed his plan, enlarging it. Instead of a
                    three-number story, he decided to let the tale take its own course so far as length was concerned.
                    From beginning to end he wrote the story with the printers close at his heels, each instalment
                    appearing in print before the next was written, and sometimes before it was begun.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-308" n="299"/>
                <p>Ordinarily this would be an unwise and even an unsafe way of producing a story, but in this case it
                    proved quite otherwise, chiefly perhaps because the author knew his subject so well and was in love
                    with it.</p>
                <p>He had only once before attempted fiction for grown people, and that only in the form of a short
                    magazine story. How that attempt came to be made is best told in a letter recently written to me by
                    Dr. Richard Watson Gilder, editor of the <hi rend="i">Century Magazine</hi>. At the time to which
                    the letter refers Dr. Gilder was Dr. Holland&apos;s chief editorial assistant in the conduct of
                        <hi rend="i">Scribner&apos;s Monthly</hi>, now the <hi rend="i">Century Magazine</hi>, and
                    Edward Eggleston was an editor of the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi>, and a contributor of critical
                    articles to <hi rend="i">Scribner&apos;s Monthly</hi>.</p>
                <p>Dr. Gilder writes:</p>
                <p>&quot;By the way, I remember, as if it were yesterday, the Friday on which I went to the <hi
                        rend="i">Independent</hi> office and told Edward that I would stop in on the following Monday
                    and get from him a Thanksgiving story. He said: &apos; But I have never written stories for
                    grown up people.&apos; I said, simply, <pb id="VAA2342-309" n="300"/> &apos;Monday morning
                    I&apos;ll be here,&apos; and when I called on Monday morning he handed me the manuscript of
                    &apos; Huldah, the Help.&apos; This was an <hi rend="i">immediate</hi> success. We were not
                    so particular then about allowing articles to be copied, and this must have appeared in a hundred
                    newspapers. Its fiction for adults. I had never seen any child stories of his, but the geniality of
                    his literary criticisms, which we were publishing in the magazine, convinced me that he had it in
                    him to write stories.&quot;</p>
                <p>Dr. Gilder&apos;s judgment in a matter of that kind was that of an expert, as his remarkable
                    success in the conduct of his magazine, and especially in the discovery of new writers of capacity
                    and new themes for magazine use, has since abundantly proved. But he was at that time a rather young
                    man, enthusiastic, optimistic perhaps, and Edward&apos;s intimate friend. These facts prompted
                    Edward to take Mr. Gilder&apos;s judgment with a good deal of allowance and to hesitate before
                    attempting to follow up the success achieved by &quot;Huldah, the Help,&quot; with other
                    ventures in fiction.</p>
                <p>&quot;That success is not conclusive,&quot; he said to me one day when I referred to it as
                    convincing. <pb id="VAA2342-310" n="301"/> &quot;It may have been accidentala lucky hit, a thing
                    that happened to satisfy a passing fancy. I may be a man of one story they say every man has one
                    story in him.&quot;</p>
                <p>But to Mr. Gilder&apos;s urgency and mine there was presently added another, which he regarded
                    with a profounder deference, namely that of Charles F. Briggsthe &quot;Harry Franco&quot; to
                    whom Lowell had dedicated &quot;The Fable for Critics.&quot; Mr. Briggs was at that time an
                    old man, but his faculties were still unimpaired. He had at one time been famous as a novelist and
                    critic. He had ceased to write novels, and only now and then wrote a short story. But his critical
                    acumen was never so great or his critical judgment so sound as at the time of which I am writing.</p>
                <p>Referring to &quot;Huldah&quot; and its success, Mr. Briggs told Edward very earnestly that
                    he <hi rend="i">must</hi> write novels. Edward replied that he had no confidence in his fitness to
                    undertake anything so ambitious, particularly as <pb id="VAA2342-311" n="302"/>
                    &quot;Huldah&quot; was absolutely the only bit of fiction for adults he had ever ventured
                    upon.</p>
                <p>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; replied Mr. Briggs, in his pleasantly dogmatic way. &quot;Nonsense!
                    Any man who can write stories for children can write novels successfully.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward often afterwards said that it was this very positive judgment of the veteran writer which led
                    him to think seriously of novel-writing as a possible career for himself, and when the occasion for
                    writing &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; arose, his mind was so well used to the idea
                    that he felt no shrinking from the task.</p>
                <p>The success of &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; in winning circulation to <hi rend="i"
                        >Hearth and Home</hi> was so great and so immediate, that the publishers besought its author to
                    go on writing stories of Western life, and he did so, leaving the work of editing to his managing
                    editor, and after awhile surrendering his post of editor entirely, leaving me to succeed him. All
                    that will be recorded later <pb id="VAA2342-312" n="303"/> in this volume. At present we have to do
                    only with &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster.&quot;</p>
                <p>When the serial publication was ended it was decided to bring the story out in book form. But an
                    unwise economy in the publication office forbade its proper presentation. It had been
                    &quot;set&quot; in brevier type for the newspapera type much too small for book use, but it
                    was decided to save the cost of resetting, or a part of it, by &quot;overrunning&quot; the
                    linesthat is, transferring the type from one line to another in order to make the lines long enough
                    for book page use. The saving was trifling, and the result of it was that the volume was a thin,
                    uncomely one, with smaller type than is fit for use in a book.</p>
                <p>In spite of this parsimonious treatment, however, the popularity of the book was phenomenal, its
                    sales running up to fifty thousand copies in a few months, and continuing year after year. A year or
                    two ago a new edition was made, with good paper, proper type and better illustrations than <pb
                        id="VAA2342-313" n="304"/> those used before, and in this worthier dress the book continues to
                    sell like a new and popular novel, nearly a third of a century after its first publication. It has
                    been translated into Dutch, Danish, French and German, and a large pirated edition has been sold in
                    England.</p>
                <p>Such is the story of &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster.&quot; It is proper to explain, however,
                    that while the original impulse to write it grew out of my boyish experiences as a schoolmaster on
                    Riker&apos;s Ridge, the story is indebted to those experiences for nothing more than that vague
                    suggestion, but is altogether an original, creation. Riker&apos;s Ridge was not Flat Creek, nor
                    did it in any important way resemble Flat Creek. Charley Gand Needy Ledgerwood did in some remote
                    degree suggest Bud Means and Shocky, as Edward always believed, but in neither case is the
                    resemblance close enough to suggest the most distant portraiture or even a close drawing from a
                    model.</p>

                <head type="subtitle">The Minnesota Preacher.</head>
                <p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> the time of Edward Eggleston&apos;s return to Minnesota, a great horde of
                    young men from all parts of the Union were hurrying thither. Their purpose was to make a living and
                    possibly to achieve fortune. The only fortune he sought was the privilege of living, the ability to
                    go on breathing in spite of the condition of his lungs. Beyond that he had no hope or expectation,
                    no desire, even, except to do well and faithfully the work in the world to which he believed that
                    God had called him. To that end he at this time made a great renunciation. From boyhood the itch of
                    writing had been strong upon him, and during the six months of his ministry in southern Indiana his
                    writings, chiefly for the denominational newspapers, had attracted <pb id="VAA2342-315" n="306"/>
                    wide attention by their vigor of utterance and their shrewd insight into the moving impulses of
                    human nature. His ambition to become a writer was greatly encouraged by the plaudits of his elders,
                    whom he modestly regarded as his betters, as well as by the approval of readers unknown to him
                    personally. But the thought of &quot;consecration &quot;was dominant in his soul. It was a
                    doctrine much insisted upon, in theory at least, among the Methodist clergy at that time, and Edward
                    was disposed to apply it in practice, as he always applied every conviction of duty to the conduct
                    of life. He had somewhere read the story of a young Catholic monk, whose artistic gift was so great
                    that his ecclesiastical superior, discovering it, strenuously sought to drive him back to the world,
                    offering to secure his absolution from all his vows, and commanding him to quit the cloister and
                    exercise the great gifts that God had bestowed upon him. The struggle in the young monk&apos;s
                    soul was <pb id="VAA2342-316" n="307"/> a terrible one, but at last, according to the legend, his
                    conscience conquered. He destroyed his pictures, burned his brushes, emptied his paint tubes, and
                    resolutely put ambition behind him as a temptation of the devil.</p>
                <p>Without for a moment believing himself to be possessed of literary genius, Edward Eggleston had
                    definitely found out that he could write acceptably for print, and the ambition to do so was strong
                    within him. He believed it to be a temptation of the devil, designed to impair his
                    &quot;consecration,&quot; and to win his soul away from God.</p>
                <p>This view was very generally held at that time and for long afterward. When &quot;The Hoosier
                    Schoolmaster&quot; was in the heyday of its popularity, one of Edward&apos;s former mentors,
                    an old clergyman of high intelligence and considerable culture, wrote to him in admiration of the
                    book, but ended by admonishing him as earnestly as Wolsey did Cromwell to &quot;fling away
                    ambition.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-317" n="308"/>
                <p>&quot;The literary life,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is tempting you, I fear, to your
                    destruction. In your very success I scent danger for your soul. These things lead away from God. No
                    man can serve two masters. I question if true consecration is compatible with the literary work you
                    are doing.&quot;</p>
                <p>This conviction of the necessity of consecration had been strong in Edward&apos;s mind during
                    youth and early manhood, and it had exercised a decisive influence upon his career at many points.
                    His extraordinary subjection to his own consciencea subjection which endured to the end of his
                    lifeled him in youth to govern himself resolutely by teachings which most others accepted in theory,
                    but with far less disposition to interpret them literally or to apply them rigidly to personal
                    conduct. Long before &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; was written Edward had learned to
                    interpret his own duty, not less conscientiously indeed, but with a broader understanding of what
                    his duty was, so that. <pb id="VAA2342-318" n="309"/> in doing his work as a writer he felt no fear
                    that he was going wrong. But during his early ministry this matter sorely troubled him. He not only
                    restrained the impulse to write, but when, upon occasion, he produced literary work that he thought
                    worthy, he became alarmed over the pleasure he felt in it, and resolutely destroyed his manuscript.</p>
                <p>&quot;It was just as well so,&quot; he used to say in later life.</p>
                <p>&quot;The world lost nothing by the destruction of those manuscripts, and neither did I. Possibly
                    both the world and I would have profited if I had destroyed many others that I have published
                    instead.&quot;</p>
                <p>I was not personally brought into contact with the life in Minnesota at that time, and I cannot
                    presume to describe it. Nor is it necessary that I should, as Edward&apos;s own vivid
                    impressions of it are recorded or reflected in the novel entitled &quot;The Mystery of
                    Metropolisville.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-319" n="310"/>
                <p>In addition to the young men who at that time went to Minnesota Territory to win fortunes by work and
                    to &quot;grow up with the country,&quot; there was a great company of speculators there who
                    wooed fortune in less laborious ways, by starting what we have since learned to call &quot;boom
                    towns&quot; and reaping a great harvest of wealth from land speculation. These mapped out paper
                    cities with pretentious names, put forth alluring prospectuses, and sold corner lots out on the
                    unbroken prairie at fabulous prices to over-confiding new comers.</p>
                <p>A little while earlier the total population of that entire region had been less than 100,000 souls.
                    At the rate of immigration then prevailing it was confidently predicted that Minnesota would become
                    a populous State within an incredibly brief time. It was as easy as reciting the multiplication
                    table or the alphabet, to show the new comer how certainly vast wealth must be his within a year or
                    two if he had sense enough to invest <pb id="VAA2342-320" n="311"/> what money he had in lots in
                    this or that projected &quot;city,&quot; for the present covered with prairie grass, but
                    destined almost immediately to rival St. Louis and Chicago in population, wealth and business.</p>
                <p>Some of these projectors of &quot;cities&quot; were honest visionaries, deluded by their own
                    imaginings; but the greater number of them were mere gamblers upon the credulity of others. Their
                    projects were greatly aided by the operations of another class of speculators who were busily
                    projecting railroads in every direction, and so vehemently promising the early construction of those
                    highways of commerce that they often got high prices for the merest &quot;tips&quot; as to
                    the course which a projected railroad was to follow, or a confidential hint as to where a
                    &quot;junction&quot; was to be located and the prairie-grass city become a great railroad
                    centre.</p>
                <p>Behind all this speculation and serving it as a foundation was the undoubted fact that
                    Minnesota&apos;s soil and climate were particularly <pb id="VAA2342-321" n="312"/> well adapted
                    to wheat growing on a magnificent scale, and that her other undeveloped resources were many and
                    great. It was certain now that the territory must speedily become a State, and that its agriculture
                    was destined soon to make the State rich. It was easy to exaggerate all this, and it was exaggerated
                    by the speculators to such an extent that, if all their confident prophecies had been fulfilled,
                    Minnesota would today be the most populous and the wealthiest State in the Union. To the unwary at
                    that time the speedy winning of great riches seemed to depend only upon foresight in choosing the
                    right place in which to invest in lots that already bore ridiculously high prices. To such foresight
                    the projectors were always ready to help the new comer by nods and winks and confidential
                    &quot;tips.&quot;</p>
                <p>Curiously enough, as Edward Eggleston used often to point out, in the midst of a vast and universal
                    speculation which partook largely of the nature of gambling, and <pb id="VAA2342-322" n="313"/>
                    often of &quot;crooked&quot; gambling at that, there was never any prevalence of actual,
                    recognized gambling, such as constituted a leading feature of early fortune-hunting settlements
                    elsewhere in the West. Roulette and faro did not flaunt themselves in men&apos;s faces in the
                    Minnesota of those early days. Saloons were not prominent in the towns. Drunkenness was rare, and it
                    was never the habit of men there to make walking arsenals of themselves and to o about playing the
                    role of braggarts and ruffians. Crimes of violence were no more frequent in that newly-peopling
                    region than in old and well-ordered communities.</p>
                <p>These conditions are faithfully reflected in the one novel Edward Eggleston devoted to early life in
                    Minnesota, and his explanation of them was partly by reference to the character of the immigration
                    that peopled Minnesota, coming as it did largely from New England and the older States of the middle
                    West, and partly by the shrewd suggestion <pb id="VAA2342-323" n="314"/> that the lawlessness and
                    violence in other pioneer communities have been greatly exaggerated for the sake of picturesqueness,
                    by those who have written of them.</p>
                <p>Yet in the Minnesota of that time the young Methodist preacher found need enough for his ministry and
                    occasion enough for all his zeal.</p>
                <p>He began his work there in the remoter regions along the Minnesota River &quot;the frontier of
                    the frontier,&quot; he called it. His congregations were composed about equally of Indians,
                    white settlers, hunters, trappers and half-breed voyageurs. His circuit covered a vast area, over
                    which he traveled on foot, winter and summer, shod in Indian moccasins, and living out of doors
                    almost as continually as the Indians themselves did.</p>
                <p>His zeal in the work presently attracted the attention of the church authorities, and his abilities
                    strongly commended him to them. Before he was twenty-one years of <pb id="VAA2342-324" n="315"/>
                    agehe had married at twentyhe was placed in charge of one of the largest churches in St. Paul, the
                    capital and chief city of the newly-admitted State. He was afterwards stationedin accordance with
                    the itinerant systemsuccessively in St. Peter&apos;s Stillwater and Winona. Often he fell ill,
                    and was unable to accept a pastoral appointment.</p>
                <p>Once, on the occasion of an Indian outbreak, he enlisted in the volunteers, mounted his horse and set
                    out to help defend the border. In later life he was fond of telling, in an amused way, of how this
                    soldiering episode ended for him. After a long and hurried march, which the frail youth endured only
                    by making heavy drafts upon his indomitable spirit, the commander of his company came to him and
                    said:</p>
                <p>&quot;Parson, you&apos;re a good fellow, but you&apos;re not strong enough for a soldier.
                    Now, I&apos;ve got more men than horses here, and I want you to quit as a man and let me <pb
                        id="VAA2342-325" n="316"/> have your horse for a strong young fellow to ride.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward agreed to an arrangement so obviously for the good of the service, though humiliating to
                    himself. He turned his steed over to the &quot;strong young fellow,&quot; and set out to
                    walk back to the settlements. &quot;Thus ingloriously,&quot; he used to say, &quot;did
                    my military experience end. I don&apos;t know whether I was &apos;honorably
                    discharged&apos; or not, but I suppose it amounted to that, as the State afterwards voluntarily
                    paid me for my horse.&quot;</p>
                <p>During the nine years of his life in Minnesota Edward made much of intellectual growth. Wherever he
                    went and whatever the condition of his health might be he carried on his studies with tireless
                    industry and dogged persistence, ceaselessly pursuing that systematic self-instruction to which he
                    was indebted all his life for his education. During this time he read voluminously, in general
                    literature and philosophy, in several <pb id="VAA2342-326" n="317"/> languages. Little by little,
                    too, he outgrew the narrowness of view that had led him to suspect his writing impulse as an
                    instigation of the devil. He wrote a good deal now and published a little, for he had grown keenly
                    self-critical in his literary work.</p>
                <p>Very naturally his writing at that time was chiefly on more or less religious subjects; but by the
                    year 1866 he had begun to write occasionally for secular periodicals, particularly <hi rend="i">The
                        Little Corporal</hi>, a very widely circulated juvenile paper, published in Chicago. So marked
                    was his success in this work, that when, in that year, his greatly impaired health compelled him to
                    give up the ministry, he was invited to become associate editor of <hi rend="i">The Little
                    Corporal</hi>. He finally quitted Minnesota and removed to Evanston, a suburb of Chicago, where he
                    purchased the queerly constructed house shown in the illustration, making it his home for several
                    years afterwards.</p>

                <p>H<hi rend="sc">IS</hi> removal to Evanston in the spring of 1866 may be said to mark the beginning of
                    Edward Eggleston&apos;s career as a secular writer. It also marked the end of his life as a
                    Methodist minister; for while he retained his standing in the Minnesota Conference for several years
                    afterwards, he never again accepted an &quot;appointment&quot; at the hands of his Bishop.
                    And, except for his five years&apos; pastorate of the wholly independent and creedless Church of
                    Christian Endeavor, in Brooklyn, some years lateran episode of which a fuller account will be given
                    in a subsequent chapter he never again had charge of a church of any kind.</p>
                <p>While editorially connected with <hi rend="i">The Little Corporal</hi> Edward gained a considerable
                        <pb id="VAA2342-328" n="319"/> reputation as a writer for children. It was at that time that he
                    wrote for his paper the widely popular series of &quot;Chicken Little Stories,&quot; and
                    other tales for children, afterwards collected and published as &quot;The Book of Queer
                    Stories.&quot; In 1869, while these stories were still running in the paper, he brought out his
                    first book, a tender little tale for children, entitled &quot;Mr. Blake&apos;s Walking
                    Stick.&quot; It was immediately successful, and to this daynearly thirty-five years after its
                    publicationit remains a favorite among the little folk.</p>
                <p>The attractiveness of these books for young children is due to a certain rollicking good fellowship
                    which runs through them, and to that never-failing sympathy with childhood which was always a
                    dominant trait of their author&apos;s character. Even after he grew prematurely old in physique,
                    Edward Eggleston never saw a child without making love to it, and quickly winning its heart in
                    return. He had no touch or trace <pb id="VAA2342-329" n="320"/> of forbidding dignity when talking
                    with children. He never talked down at them, but made himself always their companion, and spoke to
                    them with spiritual eyes on a level with their own. He held that one should make a <hi rend="i"
                        >playmate</hi>, not a <hi rend="i">plaything</hi> of the child, and he did so himself with a
                    sincerity that never failed of its purpose. Indeed, there was always much of the sound-hearted boy
                    in him to the end, even when he was not dealing with children. It was exceedingly winning.</p>
                <p>In 1867 he took upon himself, in addition to his work on <hi rend="i">The Little Corporal</hi>, the
                    chief editorship of <hi rend="i">The National Sunday School Teacher</hi>. That periodical was the
                    outgrowth and exponent of the great and highly organized Sunday School movement which at that time
                    interested the entire country, and in which John Wanamaker, Dwight L. Moody and others were Edward
                    Eggleston&apos;s enthusiastic fellow workers. He was also active as a leader and effective as a
                    speaker, in the <pb id="VAA2342-330" n="321"/> Sunday School Institutes and conventions which were
                    then so largely attended in all parts of the country.</p>
                <p>All this while he was writing a good deal for a leading daily newspaper in Chicago, and thus
                    acquiring a trenchant editorial style which served him well in later years.</p>
                <p>More important, so far as his own career was concerned, is the fact that about 1869 he became general
                    western correspondent of the New York <hi rend="i">Independent</hi>, writing over the signature of
                    &quot;Penholder.&quot; In that seething time of new adjustments in political affairs, and
                    new thought in statesmanship, theology and philosophy, the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> was a
                    notable force. It was owned by Henry C. Bowen, and edited by Theodore Tilton, with Oliver Johnson,
                    Charles F. Briggs, Dr. William Hayes Ward, Dr. Joshua Leavitt and other strong men on its staff,
                    while at every point of importance its correspondents were selected men of the highest intellectual
                    quality.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-331" n="322"/>
                <p>Edward Eggleston&apos;s work as a correspondent attracted the attention of Mr. Bowen and Mr.
                    Tilton, and in May, 1870, they invited him to join the staff of the paper as Book Editor and
                    editorial writer. Accepting the place he removed to Brooklyn. He entered upon his new work with
                    conscience and enthusiasm, and his health being now good, he brought all of his superb energy to
                    bear upon it.</p>
                <p>During the next year Theodore Tilton fell into controversy with the proprietor of the paper. The
                    trouble grew indirectly out of the unfortunate affair between Tilton and Henry Ward Beecher. That
                    matter had not yet come to a head, but it had begun to color all of Tilton&apos;s thought and to
                    influence all his conduct. It is not my purpose to revive here a scandal that without doubt served
                    for the time being gravely to impair the morals of a community in which it was daily and hourly
                    discussed, even before it got into the courts and the newspapers. I <pb id="VAA2342-332" n="323"/>
                    mention it only because it is necessary to do so in explanation of what occurred.</p>
                <p>Theodore Tilton was always a radical of radicals. It was he who wrote in a prospectus that the <hi
                        rend="i">Independent</hi> would be &quot;as radical as truth and justice can make
                    it.&quot; During the anarchistic reign of the Commune in Paris after the Franco-Prussian War, he
                    openly advocated the cause of the Commune, and even after all the facts of its riotous career were
                    known, he ceaselessly defended itnot apologizing for its deeds of violence, arson and homicide, but
                    justifying them as the righteous proceedings of liberty-loving men fighting against privilege and
                    oppression.</p>
                <p>His thinking was equally extreme on other subjects and his utterance was daring to the limit of
                    audacity. I knew him well at that time. I was associated with him in the editorship of a daily
                    newspaper which he conducted while yet editing the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi>. I greatly liked
                    him for his liberal qualities, <pb id="VAA2342-333" n="324"/> and, in common with all who knew him,
                    admired his extraordinary brilliancy of intellect. I saw much of him, in the office and in his home,
                    and he often consulted me with respect to his troubled personal affairs.</p>
                <p>In answer to his demands I frequently gave him what I believe to have been good advice. He never
                    followed it, but in this close personal contact I learned to know, better than most, what his mood
                    was, and by that mood he was governed in nearly everything that he did. It was the mood of Sampson
                    when he pulled the pillars down, and under its impulse he wrote and printed many articles in the <hi
                        rend="i">Independent</hi> which awakened apprehension. Finally, on October 1, 1870, he wrote one
                    which both shocked and alarmed the proprietor of the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> and its readers.
                    The editorial in question was entitled &quot;Love, Marriage and Divorce,&quot; and was
                    obviously the outcome of his brooding over his own domestic relations. A passage in it ran as
                    follows:</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-334" n="325"/>
                <p>&quot;The Divine moralist who preached the Sermon on the Mount, when He said &apos;Be ye
                    therefore perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect,&apos; held up an ideal of human
                    character impossible of mortal attainment the despair of flesh-clogged souls. In like manner, in the
                    few and fragmentary notes which his biographers have saved of his uttertain. He did not rest
                    marriage on the mere legal union of spiritual union which should be so subtle in its willing bond,
                    married mate that the brief indulgence of a single vagrant a morality &apos;there is none good,
                    no not one.&apos;&quot;</p>
                <p>Having thus suggested the futility of Christ&apos;s teaching, and the uselessness of all
                    strivings to obey it, the article argued that, with human nature what it is, the teachings of the
                    Divine moralist justify divorce in the case of that lesser and lower marriage to which alone, as
                    Tilton contended, human beings can attain.</p>
                <p>The reckless audacity of this utterance, together with other things, precipitated the crisis that had
                    long been drawing near. Two <pb id="VAA2342-335" n="326"/> weeks after its publication Theodore
                    Tilton ceased to be editor of the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi>, and Edward Eggleston was chosen to
                    succeed him in that office.</p>
                <p>Edward&apos;s contract of employment as editor-in-chief of the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> was
                    for a term of years, and he entered upon the work with a feeling that at last his opportunity in
                    life had come to him. He had control of the tools with which high aspirations of service to his time
                    and country and to humanity, might be wrought into high achievements. The <hi rend="i"
                    >Independent</hi> was one of the greatest and most influential organs of opinion in all the land.
                    Its province embraced the whole field of thought and affairs. It dealt with politics, religion,
                    literature and art, all with a strong hand. In each its control afforded to a strong man an enviable
                    opportunity to impress his convictions upon men in a way to give them effect, and with the
                    assistance of such a staff of other strong men as he had working with him, it would be <pb
                        id="VAA2342-336" n="327"/> difficult to imagine a position more alluring to a man of
                    Edward&apos;s gifts and temperament.</p>
                <p>But after seven months in the place a difference of opinion arose between him and the owner of the
                    paper as to the political course it should pursue in a certain crisis, and, as the question was one
                    involving his conscience, Edward asked and secured the privilege of resigning without waiting for
                    the expiry of the six months&apos; notice which the contract required him to give.</p>
                <p>It scarcely needs saying that the necessity of doing this was a sore disappointment to hopes which
                    had been exceedingly dear to him. But on a point of conscience he had never been accustomed to
                    falter, and he did not falter now. He abandoned a position which was ideally well adapted to his
                    purposes and aspirations. He surrendered what he regarded as the greatest opportunity likely ever to
                    come to him and retired to his Brooklyn home to await such further opportunities as life might
                    offer.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-337" n="328"/>
                <p>These were not long in coming. His reputation as an editor had been fully made, and as soon as it
                    became known that he was foot-loose, the publishers of <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> approached
                    him with an offer which he presently accepted.</p>
                <p>Then followed the struggle referred to in a former chapter, to rescue the paper from its moribund
                    condition. This he did in the only way in which it could be done, namely by improving the character
                    of the paper. He began by ridding it of every incapable who had been clinging, barnaclelike, to its
                    staff, and putting better men in their places. Recognizing Mrs. Dodge&apos;s remarkable gifts,
                    he insisted upon giving her a freer hand than she had ever been allowed before, especially in the
                    way of wise expenditure for good matter and good pictures. Process picture making was unknown then.
                    Every illustration must be drawn on wood and engraved by hand, so that illustration was expensive.
                    But Edward insisted that <pb id="VAA2342-338" n="329"/> no economy should be permitted to interfere
                    with the execution of Mrs. Dodge&apos;s plans for her department. Indeed, he set his face
                    against all economies that might in any way interfere with the supreme purpose of making the paper
                    successful by making it worthy of success. I remember that, after I became his managing editor, and
                    reported that I found in my possession a great mass of accepted manuscripts, mostly the work of
                    amateursa legacy from the former administrationhe bade me go through them, throwing out every one
                    that in the least fell short of the new standard he had set up. I reminded him that the publishers
                    were under obligation to pay for all articles already accepted. His reply was quick and resolute:</p>
                <p>&quot;Report them for payment. Then throw them into your waste paper basket. It is bad enough to
                    have to pay for such stuff; it would be calamitous to print it. We can&apos;t afford to print a
                    single unworthy article, at least until we have printed enough of the <pb id="VAA2342-339" n="330"/>
                    best to give the paper a character and a reputation.&quot;</p>
                <p>As editor of the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi>, and in other relations, he had long been in close
                    touch with pretty nearly all the writers in the country who might be made available, and he
                    personally saw or wrote to all of them. Thus, in a brief time he drew into the paper&apos;s
                    service a staff of capable writers, many of them widely known. He charged me in the meanwhile to be
                    always keenly on the lookout for new writers of capacity. &quot;The best thing an editor can do
                    for his publication,&quot; he said, &quot;is to develop a new writer, and let him make his
                    name in connection with the paper.&quot;</p>
                <p>One of our &quot;finds&quot; at this time was very notable. As the Christmas season
                    approached, we found ourselves short-handed, and sought for some one to help us out. We found him in
                    Philadelphia. He had been engaged in newspaper work for several years, and was familiar with
                    methods, principles <pb id="VAA2342-340" n="331"/> and details. But he had attained to no editorial
                    position sufficiently attractive to forbid his acceptance of the offer Edward made him for a
                    temporary engagement on <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi>. He came to us to do general utility work.
                    He was a modest, unassuming man, but not lacking in that sufficient self-confidence which prompts
                    and enables strong men to do capable work.</p>
                <p>His name was Frank R. Stockton.</p>
                <p>He had not been with us a week before Edward had discovered his quality, and changed his very
                    temporary engagement into a permanent one. He remained with us until, upon the establishment of <hi
                        rend="i">St. Nicholas</hi>, he went with Mrs. Dodge, to assist in making the really wonderful
                    success which that periodical so quickly achieved. His later career as one of the foremost and most
                    popular writers of his time, is known to all who read or care for books.</p>
                <p>Edward followed &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; with &quot;The End of the
                    World&quot; <pb id="VAA2342-341" n="332"/> another memory of the Hoosier life as he had known it
                    in boyhood. In it he dealt somewhat with that strange episode in the religious life of the country,
                    the Millerite craze. He had himself seen all this in his boyhood. He remembered with what fanatic
                    faith men accepted guess-work interpretations of the peculiarly incomprehensible prophecies of
                    Daniel; how the leaders of that movement worked out from Daniel&apos;s figures the very day on
                    which the end of the world was to come, and proved it all as they might have proved any other
                    &quot;sum&quot; in arithmetic. He remembered how busily believing women toiled to get their
                    white ascension robes ready in time; how recklessly men left their fields untilled in anticipation
                    of the coming day of judgment; how crazily men and women became excited as the appointed time drew
                    near, some of them actually going mad; and how shrewdly sharpers played upon credulity and bought
                    for a trifle the possessions of the deluded <pb id="VAA2342-342" n="[]"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2342-12">
                        <p>EDWARD EGGLESTON<lb/> In Madison, Indiana, January 1899</p>
                    </figure>
                    <pb id="VAA2342-343" n="333"/> ones. He remembered, as I do, the table oil-cloths, covered with
                    &quot;the figures of prophecy,&quot; which some manufacturer was enterprising enough to put
                    upon a market eager for them, and which remained in practical domestic use long after the excitement
                    that had made them marketable died out. It is a pity that nobody at that time was farseeing enough
                    to preserve one of those oilcloths as a historic curiosity. Nobody seems to have done so, however,
                    as Edward&apos;s offer of a hundred dollars for a single specimen, though long continued and
                    widely advertised, brought no response.</p>
                <p>It was characteristic of Edward that he regarded even this credulity and fanaticism with respect, as
                    he looked back upon that time and made literary use of it. In our parents&apos; house he, as a
                    boy of five or six years old, heard nothing but contempt and ridicule for the craze while it was in
                    progress. Our father would not permit the subject to be seriously discussed in the presence of his
                        <pb id="VAA2342-344" n="334"/> family. Our mother used smilingly to ridicule the folly of making
                    ascension robes out of cotton cloth that cost a few cents a yard. And when she found that one in
                    whom she felt any interest had been infected by the insanity, she would gently set forth a higher
                    conception of God&apos;s ways and purposes than that which the doings and teachings of the
                    Millerites implied. Yet in his mature years Edward always insisted upon regarding the human weakness
                    which rendered such a fanaticism possible, with respectful pity rather than with contempt. In
                    &quot;The End of the World&quot; he laughed, indeed, at the follies it involved; but he
                    said:</p>
                <p>&quot;The intellectual attitude of those people, if it can be called an intellectual attitude,
                    was entirely logical. If a man believes in prophecy at all, he must believe that it is intended to
                    let men know what is going to happen. If the prophecies of the Old Testament were inspired
                    revelations of the future, as nearly everybody at that time believed, <pb id="VAA2342-345" n="335"/>
                    the Power that inspired them must have intended men to find out what they meant. The Millerites
                    believed that their leader had found this out, and they studied his interpretation only to find it
                    so plausible that their minds could find no flaw in it. They were more logical and more consistent
                    than the clergymen who preached against their delusion. After all, perhaps the fundamental mistake
                    lay in believing in prophecy, but that mistake, if it is a mistake, was made, not by the Millerites
                    only, but equally by those who opposed their doctrine.&quot;</p>
                <p>It was always Edward Eggleston&apos;s habit to think honestly and fearlessly. If in his youth his
                    views had been narrow and puritanical, it was only because there were no other views possible under
                    the circumstances in which he was placed, to one who thought honestly and resolutely accepted that
                    which he believed to be truth, making obedience to it the unfaltering rule of his life, no matter at
                    what cost of self-restraint and self <pb id="VAA2342-346" n="336"/> sacrifice. He was taught that
                    the Bible was unquestionably the one only revelation of God&apos;s thought to man. The only form
                    in which he knew the Bible in his boyhood was the accepted English version, and he was taught to
                    take that literally. The absolutely necessary result of such teaching to a boy of his character, was
                    asceticism, puritanism something akin in spirit to monasticism in its least enlightened forms.</p>
                <p>But it was equally inevitable that a mind such as his, exercising itself in absolute obedience to a
                    conscience that loved truth above all else, should outgrow these trammels of the intellect and shake
                    them off.</p>
                <p>At the time of which I am now writing Edward had done this in a very great degree. He had grown
                    liberal. His enlarged knowledge had given him better points of view. His habit of looking with open
                    eyes in his search for truth, had enabled him to make the most of those points of view. His
                    extensive reading, in literature, philosophy <pb id="VAA2342-347" n="337"/> and history, had taught
                    him new principles of interpretation. His large and varied contact with men of every kind and class,
                    from the trapper and half-breed on the frontier to the finest scholars and thinkers of his time, had
                    enlarged his conceptions, not only of human kind, but of human life and its relations.</p>
                <p>One other fact must be considered. The liberalization of thought and the enlargement of knowledge
                    which he shared, were not his alone, but the common possession of all men who were accustomed to
                    think. He was living in a more enlightened time than that of his boyhood. Even in those regions in
                    which his childhood had been passed, the schoolmaster and the newspaper, and the circulating
                    library, had been doing their work and doing it well. The narrow teachings that had been drilled
                    into him in boyhood were no longer heard anywhere in the land. The harsh rigidity of life had been
                    relaxed during that wonderful <pb id="VAA2342-348" n="338"/> quarter of a century since he had first
                    gone to school.</p>
                <p>In theology Edward had grown both liberal and unsettled as to his beliefsa change which was destined
                    to be progressive and continuous. He was still religious by habit and sentiment, but all dogmatism
                    had gone out of him. He was tolerant of everything but intolerance, and he was generously disposed
                    even to look upon that with pity rather than condemnation in his mind.</p>
                <p>He still retained his membership in the Minnesota Conference, partly from a feeling of good
                    fellowship and partly because he felt a keen sympathy with the preachers out there in the good work
                    they were doing for morality and the amelioration of life. But he had become so unorthodox in his
                    beliefs that one of them threatened him about this time with a heresy prosecution because he wrote
                    in one of his novels that it is only a theological quibble which denies <pb id="VAA2342-349" n="339"
                    /> to marriage an equal rank with baptism and the eucharist as a sacrament.</p>
                <p>While Edward was writing &quot;The End of the World,&quot; he left the work of editing the
                    paper mainly to me, and when the second novel achieved a success approximately as great as that of
                    &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster,&quot; he decided to give up editorial tasks entirely, and
                    devote himself exclusively to literary work. He resigned his place as editor, and I succeeded him in
                    it.</p>

                <p>U<hi rend="sc">NDER</hi> Edward&apos;s wise direction <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> had by
                    this time gained reputation and influence as a publication of consequence, not only because of the
                    good literature it presented, but still more because of the ability of its editorial columns. In
                    these all matters of importanceall public affairs of large consequence, all questions of education
                    and all matters that in any vital way concerned the welfare of the people were discussed with care
                    and thought, not only by Edward himself, and by the able editorial staff he had gathered about him,
                    but also by other writers of unusual strength. Among these contributing editorial writers whose
                    writing was so frequent as to render them almost members of the staff, were Helen <pb
                        id="VAA2342-351" n="341"/> Hunt, Mrs. L. I. G. Runkle, Rebecca Harding Davis, George E. Waring,
                    Jr., Asa Gray, Edward Everett Hale, Mary G. Humphrey?, and several others.</p>
                <p>It was Edward&apos;s practice to write comparatively little himself on the editorial page. He
                    rarely contributed more than one article in that department to any one number. It was his conviction
                    that a variety of minds in editorial discussion is as important as a variety of topics. I remember
                    that when Theodore Tilton set up his paper, <hi rend="i">The Golden Age</hi>, and said that he meant
                    to write the whole editorial page, Edward said to him: &quot;You&apos;ll score a failure,
                    Theodore. No editorial page can live on the gushings of one man, however able and however brilliant
                    he may be.&quot;</p>
                <p>In the same way he absolutely refused to burden his mind with details or to waste his time over them,
                    after he had got the office into a good state of organization. He left all such things to his
                    managing editor and <pb id="VAA2342-352" n="342"/> his subordinates, and devoted himself exclusively
                    to the larger work of general direction.</p>
                <p>As his conduct of the paper had won for it recognition and influence, so, by the time when
                    &quot;The End of the World&quot; was published, his novels had multiplied its circulation
                    many times over. He felt that he had accomplished the task undertaken. He had lifted the paper out
                    of the mire and set it firmly on solid ground. He was anxious to rid himself of the harness, and he
                    felt that he could do so without fear that his work would be undone by a weaker direction on the
                    part of those whom he left to take up the task where he laid it down.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, and in illustration of the difficulties Edward had met and overcome, it is of interest
                    to relate some things that happened during the publication of the serials.</p>
                <p>When &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; began to appear, a member of the publishing house
                    was sorely troubled. He had been a <pb id="VAA2342-353" n="343"/> bitter and vehement opponent of
                    novels and novel reading. He had published articles of his own in denunciation of fiction and in
                    rebuke of his friends in a great publishing house for putting forth literature of that character. He
                    now began to suspect that &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; was in fact a novel, and he
                    was shocked at the thought that it was appearing in a periodical published by himself. But it was
                    manifestly multiplying the circulation of that periodical and changing its status from that of a
                    losing venture to that of a paying property; so under the urgent insistence of his business partners
                    he reconciled himself to the situation.</p>
                <p>But when the story was about to appear in book form Edward wrote &quot;A Novel&quot; as
                    sub-title, and the publisher referred to was again in a state of nervous agitation. He could in no
                    wise consent to proclaim himself as a publisher of novels. In view of the large advance orders for
                    the book he was <pb id="VAA2342-354" n="344"/> eager to publish the novel, but he could not
                    reconcile himself to the open admission that it was a novel.</p>
                <p>A little later we began publishing Jean Ingelow&apos;s story,&quot; Off the
                    Skelligs,&quot; so that the paper had two serials running at the same time. One morning the
                    novel-hating publisher called upon Edward with a copy each of <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home</hi> and
                    one of the most sensational story papers then in existence. He spread the two out and said to
                    Edward:</p>
                <p>&quot;If there is any difference between these two sheets I wish you would show me what it is. I
                    can&apos;t discover it.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward heaved a little sigh of weariness and answered:</p>
                <p>&quot;If you cannot discover the difference for yourself I certainly cannot teach you to see
                    it.&quot;</p>
                <p>When we began publishing &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; this publisher went to Edward
                    to offer a suggestion. The illustrations of the story were surrounded by text, <pb id="VAA2342-355"
                        n="345"/> of course, and where the text happened to include conversation the broken lines left
                    blank ends next the picture. This publisher was a stickler for what he called &quot;framing a
                    picture&quot; with its accompanying letter-press; so the happy thought seized him that Edward
                    might insert enough words in each broken line of conversation to extend it to the margin of the
                    illustrations. He had been at pains to fill out the lines with his pencilmaking a row of
                    o&apos;sby way of showing how much better the thing would look if done in that way. I think he
                    never quite forgave Edward for his refusal to tinker his text in the fashion suggested.</p>
                <p>Upon resigning his editorial place, Edward agreed to write one more serial story for <hi rend="i"
                        >Hearth and Home</hi>, and he set to work upon it immediately. This time he chose for his theme
                    the life in Minnesota as he had known it, and produced &quot;The Mystery of
                    Metropolisville.&quot; This was a broadening of his field somewhat, and the conditions in <pb
                        id="VAA2342-356" n="346"/> which the story was laid were quite different from those of the two
                    Hoosier stories. In the earlier novels he had dealt with a life and people whose characteristics
                    were well defined. In the new story he must depict a life that was formless as yet, and a people
                    whose gathering together in one community was so recent that they could scarcely be thought of as
                    one people. They were a conglomerate mass of humanity, utter strangers to each other. Coming from
                    all parts of the country, as they had done, they had little in common. There were no well-defined
                    characteristics, no prevalent habits, customs or ideas that the novelist could seize upon. For
                    purposes of literary art, such a people afforded far less opportunity than did the Hoosiers. Yet the
                    new story proved very successful both as a serial and in book form.</p>
                <p>Edward was gravely dissatisfied with it when it was done, and he determined to write no more novels
                    for a considerable time to come.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-357" n="347"/>
                <p>He was not permitted to carry this determination into effect, for by this time editors and publishers
                    were, metaphorically, sitting on his doorsteps in eager rivalry to secure a novel at his hands. In
                    the meantime he had got a little rest, and his refreshed mind was subconsciously at work upon a new
                    theme. He had always been impressed with the heroic self-sacrifice of the Methodist circuit riders,
                    and the picturesqueness of their life in the early days in the West. The theme fascinated him, after
                    the thought of using it in fiction had once entered his mind. He had known these men, and he had in
                    some measure shared their life. Their inspiration had been his own through years of toil and
                    hardship. His equipment was perfect for the sympathetic handling of the subject. Accordingly, he
                    accepted an offer made to him by the editor of <hi rend="i">The Christian Union</hi>, and was soon
                    at work on &quot;The Circuit Rider, a Tale of the Heroic Age.&quot;</p>
                <p>This story took him back again to the <pb id="VAA2342-358" n="348"/> Hoosier life, but with a larger
                    purpose and perhaps with a sounder conception of its significance. The piece was a new departure in
                    other ways. It was more carefully wrought than its predecessors had been, for the reason that its
                    author had leisure now, and did not write each week to furnish &quot;copy&quot; to clamorous
                    printers against a pre-appointed day of issue. It was far more serious than the others had been, and
                    far more literary. It gave proof of larger powers than he had shown before.</p>
                <p>When &quot;The Circuit Rider&quot; was finished Edward suspended his work in the field of
                    fiction, as he had meant to do before. &quot;The Circuit Rider&quot; was published in 1874.
                    He did not publish another novel until 1878.</p>
                <p>During that time of suspension he brought out no book except a little volume of juvenile stories. He
                    was writing a good deal for the magazines, however, both over his own name in the general pages, and
                        <pb id="VAA2342-359" n="349"/> anonymously in the editorial departments. He was also compiling
                    and editing two sumptuously published subscription books, the one called&quot; Christ in
                    Art,&quot; and the other &quot;Christ in Literature.&quot;</p>

                <head type="subtitle">The Christian Endeavor Episode.</head>
                <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster,&quot; as every reader of that story
                    remembers, Ralph Hartsook and Bud Means organized themselves into the &quot;Church of the Best
                    Licks.&quot; It was Edward&apos;s dream some day to have charge of such a church in
                    factcreedless, caring nothing for dogmatic theology, exacting no profession of faith of its members,
                    and devoting its endeavors solely to the betterment of men and women, the uplifting of those who
                    were down, the encouragement of those who despaired, the strengthening of the weak and the
                    amelioration of life in every way possible.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1874 the opportunity to realize this dream came to him. He was asked to take charge
                    of the Lee Avenue <pb id="VAA2342-361" n="351"/> Congregational Church in Brooklyn. He frankly
                    stated his condition of mind. He could not meet the requirements of any orthodox council, nor would
                    he on any account take charge of a church which imposed any creed upon its members or exacted any
                    profession of faith at their hands.</p>
                <p>The church accepted his terms, abandoned its ecclesiastical relations, and changed its name to The
                    Church of Christian Endeavor, a phrase which Edward devised as a dignified equivalent of The Church
                    of the Best Licks.</p>
                <p>For four or five years he carried on this philanthropic work with enthusiasm. He was mightily
                    supported in it by other strong men whose sympathy with Christian Endeavor found expression in
                    tireless work. The membership of the church grew rapidly, and its congregations were swelled to a
                    multitude. Many of those who labored in this cause of uplifting were men and women of orthodox
                    belief. Indeed the majority of <pb id="VAA2342-362" n="352"/> the members were persons of that kind;
                    for neither the church nor its pastor offered the smallest objection to any one&apos;s faith,
                    whatever it might be. They insisted only that the church should itself set up no creed standards in
                    its organized capacity. Every member was free to believe as he pleased, so long as he stood ready to
                    aid the church&apos;s work of human betterment. One day a Quaker family applied to Edward for
                    admission. They frankly said that if it were required that they should be baptized, they would
                    submit themselves to the ordinance, but to them it would be an entirely meaningless form. Edward
                    laid the case before the church, declaring his own conviction that baptism ought not to be required
                    as a condition of membership, and the church voted, without a dissenting voice, to accept the
                    Quakers without any requirement as to forms and ceremonies.</p>
                <p>Some Unitarians, and many persons who had never formulated their beliefs even in <pb id="VAA2342-363"
                        n="353"/> their own minds, united with the church and aided earnestly in its work. But in the
                    main its members were persons of orthodox beliefs, who were liberal enough in spirit to see no
                    reason why they should exact like beliefs on the part of others as a condition of a harmonious
                    working together for good.</p>
                <p>It was no part of Edward&apos;s purpose to win anybody away from his faith. He made no war upon
                    any man&apos;s creed. He made no effort to induce any other to accept his own views, or to think
                    as he did on religious subjects. He never discussed such things in the pulpit or elsewhere. He
                    simply did not care for creeds, or in any way concern himself with them. He was not at all an
                    aggressive apostle of liberalism in theological belief; he never discussed that subject; he pleaded
                    only for liberality in endeavors to help those who needed help and to better human conditions in
                    every way possible.</p>
                <p>He had an enthusiastic Sunday-school, outnumbering any other in Brooklyn, and he <pb id="VAA2342-364"
                        n="554"/> devised many ingenious ways in which to interest the children. He secured the
                    assistance of his friends among orthodox clergymen and laymen, with now and then some one who had no
                    church relations whatever, and induced them to come to his Sunday-school and talk to the children.</p>
                <p>He built up a library in the church, contributing liberally to it himself, and inducing all his
                    friends to contribute either money or books.</p>
                <p>He organized a society of the young men for the perfectly free discussion of subjects of practical
                    human interest. Into this society he had no trouble in drawing a large number of workingmen of
                    active minds, who discussed there questions of tariff, trades unionism, the relations of capital and
                    labor, and whatever else they were interested in as matters practically affecting their welfare in
                    the world.</p>
                <p>In brief, this was a church of the Best Licks, to which Abou Ben Adhem would <pb id="VAA2342-365"

                <p>Its conduct and the guidance of its undertakings involved ceaseless labor on Edward&apos;s part.
                    It was labor joyfully given, but it enormously overtaxed his meagre strength. After four or five
                    years of it his nervous system completely broke down, and in 1879 he resigned his charge, thus
                    finally quitting the ministry.</p>
                <p>He sailed with his family for Europe immediately, intending to remain there for a prolonged period.
                    But before going he told me what I had already guessed, namely, that the strain which had done more
                    than all else to bring on his collapse, was not that of ceaseless work, but that of a mind ill at
                    ease. When he assumed charge of that church he had indeed lost his belief in dogmatic theology, but
                    he retained enough of faith to enable him to preach acceptably, with a little care. During the four
                    years or more of his pastorate, through reading, study, and earnest <pb id="VAA2342-366" n="356"/>
                    thought, even this small share of faith had slipped away from him, until at the last he frankly said
                    to me, something like this:</p>
                <p>&quot;There isn&apos;t a shred or a raveling of belief in the supernatural left in me. How
                    can I go on preaching, when in doing so I seem, to others at least, to profess what I no longer
                    believe? For the last year I have had to study carefully every word I have spoken from the pulpit,
                    lest I use terms that might imply a faith which I have not, and thus, while preaching morality, be
                    guilty of an immorality on my own account. It has been a terrible strain, a sore conflict, and my
                    health has given way under it. I have wanted to go on with this work, because of the great good it
                    is doing to others. If it could have been completely secularized, and so stripped of all appearance
                    of a religious effort, I should have had strength to continue it. As it is, I should have felt
                    myself in conscience bound to give it up, even if my strength had <pb id="VAA2342-367" n="357"/>
                    held out. My only hope is that some one may be found who can carry it on in the form and name of
                    religion, without having to compromise with his conscience, as I should have to do with
                    mine.&quot;</p>
                <p>Thus ended another chapter of Edward Eggleston&apos;s life.</p>
                <p>From that hour forward he never entered a pulpit. He had already withdrawn from the Methodist church,
                    as well as from its ministry, and while he never antagonized the faith he had long and
                    conscientiously held, he never concealed the fact that he no longer accepted any part of it.</p>

                    four or five years given to the Christian Endeavor enterprise he had devoted practically all of his
                    salary to the work in which he felt so vital an interest. In the meanwhile he had depended for the
                    support of his family upon his copyrights and upon his labors with the pen. He wrote a good deal for
                    the magazines, at rates of pay which were then deemed very liberal, and in 1878 he brought out a new
                    novel, &quot;Roxy&quot;his first book in four years.</p>
                <p>&quot;Roxy&quot; was founded upon an occurrence that had been known to both of us in youth,
                    an occurrence which brought out the unconscious heroism of a good, simple-minded woman, in humble
                    life, in <pb id="VAA2342-369" n="[]"/>

                    <pb id="VAA2342-370" n="359"/> a way that would be impossible to most women.</p>
                <p>Curiously enough, one newspaper critic at least, and perhaps others, criticised the story as immoral,
                    because it hinged upon a sinful incident. The criticism was as applicable to Hawthorne&apos;s
                    &quot;Scarlet Letter&quot; as to &quot;Roxy.&quot; It utterly ignored the fact that
                    the sinful incident was handled with the extreme of delicacy, and with the highest moral purpose and
                    effect. To be consistent the critic must have condemned all preachers for mentioning theft, murder,
                    robbery or any other sin for the purpose of rebuking it.</p>
                <p>Edward knew how to live comfortably at small cost, whether in Europe or at home, and so he made no
                    use of a generosity which was at this time extended to him. Roswell Smith, publisher and chief owner
                    of <hi rend="i">Scribner&apos;s Monthly</hi>afterwards <hi rend="i">The Century Magazine</hi>
                    had become one of Edward&apos;s most devoted friends. He had made so great a success of the
                    magazine that&quot; his fortune was now <pb id="VAA2342-371" n="360"/> ample, and, with one of
                    those generous impulses which always governed his conduct, he went to Edward one day, just before
                    the date of sailing, and bade him be at ease during his stay abroad. &quot;My purse is
                    absolutely at your disposal,&quot; he said. &quot;Draw upon me for whatever money you need,
                    whenever you want it, and pray don&apos;t think of the sum, whatever it may be, as a debt to be
                    repaid. I shall consider it only a privilege if you allow me to help you regain your strength. I
                    want to <hi rend="i">endow your work</hi> for the public&apos;s sake, and you must let me do
                    so.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward was much too independent of spirit to accept such an offer, though heknew that it was made
                    with the utmost sincerity. But he never forgot the generosity of it. &quot;There are not many
                    such men as Roswell Smith,&quot; he used to say, &quot;in this money-grubbing world of
                    ours.&quot;</p>
                <p>Edward&apos;s first concern in Europe was to get well by rest. Fora time he did no work not even
                    reading a book for entertainment.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-372" n="361"/>
                <p>He went up into the Swiss mountains and lived there for a time among the peasants, in the district
                    from which our Vevay Swiss people had emigrated. He found among them relatives and near friends of
                    the Vevay settlers, and they never tired of questioning him concerning the American Vevay and its
                    people.</p>
                <p>He lived out of doors during his waking hours, sometimes going into the vineyards and helping in the
                    work of grape gathering. On these occasions the stout peasant women would watch carefully for the
                    filling of his basket, and when it was full one of them would hurriedly snatch it away and carry it
                    to the receptacle into which all the baskets must be emptied. They were determined that
                    &quot;the dear monsieur&quot; should do no heavy work. When the hour came for quitting the
                    vineyard the peasants would line themselves up in two rows and ask him to pass through and walk in
                    front of them. When he wandered along a road, accom <pb id="VAA2342-373" n="362"/> panied by his
                    blonde-haired little granddaughter, the peasants would select the finest clusters of grapes, arrange
                    them upon leaves and present them to her with positive reverence for a child whom they called
                    &quot;the little American angel,&quot; because of her fair face and blonde locks.</p>
                <p>After a time Edward went to Paris, London and Venice, living in each of those cities for months at a
                    time. It was in Venice that he wrote &quot;The Hoosier School Boy,&quot; and later
                    &quot;The Graysons.&quot; He used to say that it interested him mightily, after living all
                    day in the atmosphere of the great primitive West, where the scene of his story was laid, to pass
                    almost instantly into the historic surroundings of Venice, which he could do merely by throwing down
                    his pen and going out of doors. One can easily understand the fascination a thought of that kind
                    must have had for an imaginative man.</p>
                <p>Apart from the recovery of his health, the most important result of his residence in <pb
                        id="VAA2342-374" n="363"/> Europe was the suggestion that came to him there as to his future
                    work. It was from the reflective calm of that life that he wrote to me, about the beginning of the
                    year 1880, telling me of his newly formed plan.</p>
                <p>&quot;I am going to write a series of volumes,&quot; he wrote, &quot;which together shall
                    constitute a History of Life in the United States not a history of the United States, bear in mind,
                    but a history of life there, the life of the people, the sources of their ideas and habits, the
                    course of their development from beginnings. These beginnings will be carefully studied in the first
                    volume. Beyond that my plans for the ordering of the material are not fully formed. It will be a
                    work designed to answer the questions &apos;How?&apos; and &apos;Whence?&apos; and
                    &apos;Why?&apos; All this will require a great deal of research, but I stand ready to give
                    ten years of my life to the task, if necessary.&quot;</p>
                <p>In the event the research required proved to be much greater even than he had <pb id="VAA2342-375"
                        n="364"/> anticipated. He gave not ten, but twenty years to the work, and died at last leaving
                    it scarcely more than begun. The two volumes that were published&quot;The Beginners of a
                    Nation&quot; and &quot;The Transit of Civilization,&quot; are the only direct fruits we
                    have or ever shall have of that twenty years of ceaseless and scholarly study. But these alone are
                    well worth all that they cost of toilsome research, while the incidental fruit of his labors is
                    perhaps of even greater value to the public. These are found in those school histories and the like,
                    in which he fairly revolutionized the teaching of history in schools, and devised new methods so
                    good that other writers of school history have felt it necessary to borrow themsometimes copying so
                    closely as to excite wonder and invite criticism.</p>
                <p>Having conceived this undertaking, Edward set to work upon it at once. For years he studied in the
                    British Museum, the French National Library, and in many rich <pb id="VAA2342-376" n="365"/> private
                    libraries in England and France which were generously thrown open to him. Then he returned to
                    America, and set himself to the task of exhausting the resources of the public and private libraries
                    in this countrythe Astor and Lenox in New York, the Boston Public Library and the Athenaeum in
                    Boston, the Congressional Library in Washington, many college collections and a multitude of private
                    libraries, besides a great number of manuscript letters and records preserved in the homes of old
                    colonial families.</p>
                <p>In prosecuting his researches he made many interesting &quot;finds,&quot; including one very
                    notable one. This was a manuscript account of Bacon&apos;s Rebellion, written by Nathaniel Bacon
                    himself. Edward came upon it by accident one day while looking through a wagon load of unsorted and
                    unexamined manuscripts in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>One thing that made Edward&apos;s researches time-consuming was his propensity to be <pb
                        id="VAA2342-377" n="366"/> come interested in whatever he read, whether it bore directly on his
                    subject or not. He would read books through, in which only a chapter perhaps was necessary to his
                    purpose. Sometimes he became interested in books that had nothing in them of importance to him, and
                    very often, as he once told me, the reading of a week or more would result in giving him material
                    only for a brief paragraph, or perhaps a single line in his own work.</p>
                <p>Another thing that prolonged his researches beyond the time he had assigned to them, was his early
                    discovery that he could in no wise trust secondary authorities, but must in every case explore the
                    originals. He found that the trustworthiness of secondary authorities was impaired by many
                    influences. Some of them had been carelessly written, with too little knowledge and too little
                    conscientiousness in research. Some were in error because of the absence of opportunity on the part
                    of their authors to <pb id="VAA2342-378" n="367"/> get at the whole truth. Some erred through
                    misinterpretation of facts known, and some through a too ready and too confident acceptance of
                    traditional belief. Prejudice marred some, and in many cases the truth was perverted in obedience to
                    local pride or hero worship, or patriotic enthusiasm, or partisanship, or, most frequently of all, a
                    mistaken pride of ancestry. Edward found, for example, that the Pilgrims and Puritans on the one
                    hand, and the ancestors of the &quot;First Families of Virginia&quot; on the other, were a
                    much more commonplace set of people than their book-writing descendants had agreed in representing
                    them to be.</p>
                <p>There was no glamour upon him. He sought for truth with wide open eyes, and did not blink when he
                    found it to be unlovely and destructive of commonly accepted beliefs. The introduction he wrote to
                    &quot;The Beginners of a Nation&quot; was positively distressing to many, and it even
                    angered some by its relentless truthfulness and its iconoclastic <pb id="VAA2342-379" n="368"/> lack
                    of reverence for the past and its people. But it was a simple piece of truth telling, by one who had
                    taken pains to find out the truth and whose sole purpose it was to reveal it.</p>
                <p>Parts of the bookrather more than a dozen chapters of it, each complete as a study, were published
                    from time to time in the <hi rend="i">Century Magazine,</hi> but it was not until late in the
                    nineties that &quot;The Beginners of a Nation&quot; appeared in book form. It was followed a
                    year or two later by the second volume, entitled &quot;The Transit of Civilization.&quot;</p>
                <p>With this second work, fascinating as its interest is, Edward was gravely dissatisfied. It was not
                    what he had intended it to be. It was, as he said, born before its time. That is to say, finding
                    that his health was failing, he feared that death might come to him before he could complete the
                    book in the form and with the fulness he had intended to give it. In order that his years of work
                    upon it, and the rich results of his seventeenth cenfury <pb id="VAA2342-380" n="369"/> explorations
                    might not be wholly lost to scholarship and history, he decided to put the volume into such shape as
                    he had strength left to give it, and thus to publish it.</p>
                <p>I am frequently asked by letter and in person, whether it may not be possible for some other hand to
                    write the other volumes of his &quot;History of Life in the United States,&quot; using the
                    rich store of materials he had collected. I am obliged to answer no. The greater part of his
                    materials he carried only in his own memory. The notes that would have enabled him, had he lived, to
                    do the work intended, are not of a kind to be used by any other. They were scarcely more than
                    mnemonic hints and suggestions. Whatever their value might have been to him, they would have no
                    fruitfulness of suggestion to any other mind.</p>
                <p>But the work thus lost was not wholly without profit to the public. It was as an outcome of that work
                    that he wrote his school histories and the &quot;Household History <pb id="VAA2342-381" n="370"
                    /> of the United States.&quot;Something has already been said in this chapter with respect to
                    the good achieved by the publication of these smaller works, not only through their use in schools
                    and families throughout the country, but indirectly through the radical changes they compelled in
                    the methods of school history-writing on the part of other workers in that field, and in the system
                    of teaching the history of our country to its youth.</p>
                <p>In those later years, when he felt that his working power was failing and realized that he could
                    never complete the great work of his life, he felt a keen regret of course; but he confronted the
                    necessity of leaving his task unfinished with a calm philosophy and was content.</p>

                    explored the book-shops and attended book sales in search of old and rare books in many languages,
                    on subjects related to his historical studies. For the most part these were books not to be found in
                    public libraries anywhere.</p>
                <p>He had built a home for his books at Lake George, a structure of artistic beauty, with walls made of
                    the native stonetrap rockwhich always breaks in a way to show at least one perfectly straight side.
                    He now added to this another building of like construction, as a house for himself, the two
                    structures standing a little way apart and on different levels, but being connected by a
                    slate-roofed covered way.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-383" n="372"/>
                <p>Here he made his home, except that during the colder months of the year he occupied an apartment in
                    New York. He traveled a good deal at this time, partly in search of materials, and partly for the
                    sake of his wife&apos;s health, which was failing. During one of their trips to the South she
                    died in February, 1889, and the loneliness of his life was relieved only by hard and sometimes
                    excessive work.</p>
                <p>In October, 1891, he married his second wife, Frances E. Goode, of Madison, Indiana, a distant
                    relative whom he had known from her childhood. She survives him.</p>
                <p>After his second marriage he established a little home in Madison for occasional occupancy, in order
                    that his wife might pass some months of every year near her own people. His permanent residence was
                    still at Lake George, but, besides spending some time in Madison each year, he frequently lived for
                    months at a time in Washington or New York, and toward the end he spent the <pb id="VAA2342-384"
                        n="373"/> worst months of each winter in the far South. Fortunately his books had placed him
                    financially in easy circumstances, so that he was free to go and come at will, and live wherever he
                    found it most comfortable. In the summer he was always at his Lake George home, where he passed all
                    his waking hours among his books or walking through the woodlands of the mountains round about. He
                    usually went to Lake George in May, and remained there until the snow began to fly in November or
                    December.</p>
                <p>All this time he was at work upon his history, but he found time to produce a number of school books,
                    besides his &quot;Household History,&quot; and one novel, &quot;The Faith
                    Doctor,&quot; which appeared in 1891. This was the last novel he ever wrote, and the only one
                    the scene of which he laid elsewhere than in the West. It deals with New York life, and for
                    explanation of this departure from his usual practice, he urged that, after all, he <pb
                        id="VAA2342-385" n="374"/> had lived in New York longer than he had ever lived anywhere else,
                    and knew New York life better than he did that of any other part of the country. His theme gave him
                    opportunity also to study and depict certain very interesting phases of character, as affected by
                    religious beliefs and enthusiasms. His heroine, around whom the story is written, was drawn with a
                    peculiarly strong and deft hand, all the more so because, in her enthusiasm, her conscientiousness
                    and her blind, self-sacrificing devotion to duty as she understood it, she very closely resembled
                    himself in his youth and young manhood. He knew what Agatha thought and felt at every emotional
                    crisis, because he had thought and felt in the same way once upon a time.</p>
                <p>Two years later he published a collection of short stories entitled &quot;Duffels,&quot; and
                    that was the last excursion he ever made into the field of fiction, great or small. Indeed a great
                    and growing distaste for fiction came upon him about this time. When a few <pb id="VAA2342-386"
                        n="375"/> years before his death, I wrote a boys&apos; story called &quot;The Last of
                    the Flatboats,&quot; and made one of the characters a close, almost photographic portrait of
                    himself as he had been in boyhood, he lovingly listened while his wife read the story to him. But, a
                    little later, when one of my novels was published, he said to me:</p>
                <p>&quot;I enjoyed the boys&apos; book, Geordie, but I can&apos;t listen to the reading of a
                    novel, even though you did write it.&quot;</p>
                <p>About three years before his death he was stricken suddenly one day with blindness in one eye. He
                    believed this to be a slight stroke of apoplexy, as subsequent events clearly showed that it was.
                    But the oculists whom he consulted at the time made a different diagnosis, and after a little while
                    the sight came back to the eye affected.</p>
                <p>After that there was a slow but steady and continuous decline of strength and activity.
                    Edward&apos;s mind remained clear and his thinking vigorous, but there was some <pb
                        id="VAA2342-387" n="376"/> loss of memory, some forgetfulness of words, and now and then some
                    confusion of things remembered. The gout with which he had suffered a good deal, seemed to grow
                    steadily less severe, and his physical health was excellent. But he walked with some difficulty and
                    lost the flexibility of his muscles. It was sometimes difficult for him to seat himself or to rise
                    from a chair.</p>
                <p>He continued to work a little now and then, both upon his &quot;History of Life&quot; and
                    upon a school book that is not yet published, which was the very last literary work he ever
                    attempted.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1902 he grew so much worse that he entirely ceased to attempt work of any kind. He
                    found it distressing to write a letter, or even a note, yet he suffered no pain of any kind, enjoyed
                    converse with his friends, and seemed altogether happy in his Lake George home. His cottage and mine
                    a few hundred yards awaywere the only ones occupied so early in the year. One <pb id="VAA2342-388"
                        n="377"/> afternoon, having finished my writing for the day, I decided to go fishing for an hour
                    or so, and, seeing me preparing, Edward called to me, saying that he would go with me. He had quite
                    ceased to go on the water, because he was suffering, not only with a muscular stiffness which
                    rendered it well nigh impossible for him to get into or out of a boat, but with a giddiness which
                    rendered boating disagreeable. But I happened to have a broad, flat-bottomed fishing boat of the
                    sharpie type, with a broad stern and extraordinary steadiness in the water, and Edward thought he
                    might manage to get into that. I backed the stern up against a pier and he succeeded in getting in.</p>
                <p>As we fished, Edward presently dropped his rod overboard and the heavy reel quickly carried it to the
                    bottom. He laughed at the incident, saying:</p>
                <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know I was letting go my hold. Somehow I don&apos;t always know what
                    my hands are doing.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-389" n="378"/>
                <p>I offered him the use of my rod, but he declined, saying:</p>
                <p>&quot;I really don&apos;t want to fish. I only want to sit here in a boat with you this once
                    more before I die.&quot;</p>
                <p>I insisted that he mustn&apos;t talk about dying, whereupon he said:</p>
                <p>&quot;Oh, don&apos;t imagine that I&apos;m bothering about that. I know I have only a
                    brief time to live now, and I&apos;m not going to spend that little while in worrying. Whenever
                    death wants me, I am ready. I&apos;ve &apos;had my fling&apos; and the game is nearly
                    over. The doctors say differently, but I know my own condition far better than they do. I am
                    afflicted almost constantly with what they call festinationa tendency to run when I walk, to keep
                    from falling forward. One symptom which usually accompanies festination is lacking in my case, and
                    because of its absence the doctors insist that I have no festination at all. Nevertheless, I have it
                    very markedly. I have to run when I try to walk, and I have the greatest <pb id="VAA2342-390"
                        n="379"/> difficulty to keep from falling forward on my face.</p>
                <p>&quot;No, Geordie, I have not long to live, but I am very happy. I&apos;m glad to be with you
                    in your boat to-day, for it is my last time on the water. Do you know, the first time I was ever in
                    a row-boat, <hi rend="i">you</hi> rowed me, sturdy little fellow that you were? It pleases me to
                    have you for my oarsman this last time.&quot;</p>
                <p>I was at this time staying quite alone in my cottage and taking my meals at the country post-office
                    nearby, my family being detained in town by my son&apos;s examinations. A day or two after the
                    boating incident Edward&apos;s wife begged me to take all my meals at her house, saying that
                    Edward seemed specially to want me with him as much as possible. My work was very heavy just then,
                    so that except at meal-time it was very difficult for me to be with him, but I could do this much
                    for his gratification, and I did it gladly.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-391" n="380"/>
                <p>He talked little at these times, and never with aggressive interest in his theme; but his thinking
                    seemed as clear as ever, and his gentle humor enlivened everything he said.</p>
                <p>One morning early in June I went to his house for breakfast, and found him in a distressing
                    condition. He had been stricken with a cerebral hemorrhage during the night, and was now nearly
                    helpless. During the next two months he continued in this state. He could walk a little; he could
                    come to the table with a little help, and now and then he would ask to be helped into his library,
                    where he would sit and look lovingly at his books. But he could talk scarcely at all. He could utter
                    only brief, fragmentary sentences, and that with difficulty.</p>
                <p>Finally, near the end of August, he was stricken again, and for eight days after that he lay
                    unconscious. Then came the end, on the 4th of September.</p>
                <p>A brilliant mind had gone out. A life <pb id="VAA2342-392" n="381"/> of extraordinary activity had
                    ceased to be. A heart that had been always loving and generous, a heart that had pulsed with all
                    human sympathy, and with high enthusiasm in the service of others, had grown forever still.</p>
                <p>He had suffered no pain during all those last months, and had known no worry. The tender and
                    judicious ministry of a nobly devoted wife was his at every hour of every day. He had gone to his
                    death as in youth he had planned to do, &quot;like one who wraps the drapery of his couch about
                    him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.&quot;</p>
                <p>I think I do not suffer my affection to warp my judgment when I say that Edward Eggleston was the
                    best man I ever knew. From beginning to end of his life he not only never did a wrong to any human
                    being, but he never failed to render any service in his power to every one who had need of it, no
                    matter at what cost of self-sacrifice. He lived always for others, never for himself.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2342-393" n="382"/>
                <p>His generosity was not so much a habit as an integral part of his character, and it needed no large
                    occasion, no strong appeal to call it into activity. He was generous in small ways as well as large.
                    He was especially generous in his judgments of others, whose wrong doings he looked upon as the
                    results of a weakness which they could not help, rather than as faults for which they should be held
                    responsible.</p>
                <p>Never once in all his life, I am firmly persuaded, did Edward Eggleston give just offence to his own
                    exceedingly sensitive conscience; never did he consciously do a wrong or omit to discharge a duty.</p>
                <p>So much I take the liberty of saying in absolute sincerity to those thousands who knew this man only
                    through his writings. To those who knew him personally, nothing need be said in praise of his
                    nobility of character.</p>
