            <head>The Democratic Element in the New Republican Party in Indiana</head>
            <byline>MILDRED C. STOLER</byline>
            <p>A study of the influence in the Republican Party of the insurgent Democrats who joined the new party
                    in the eighteen-fifties is of much interest. In 1856, the Republican presidential candidate had
                    formerly been a Democrat, while in 1860, it was the vice-presidential nominee who had once been a
                    member of the Democratic party. In 1856, Republican newspapers pointed with pride to new recruits
                    from the ranks of their opponents. The issues that caused Democrats to leave their party were the
                    Administration policy on slavery and on internal improvements, opposition to the decision of the
                    party on such local issues as the legal prohibition of intoxicating liquor, and various other
                    special questions. Of these, the first named had the greatest potency. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> Act of 1854 repealed the anti-slavery provision of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Compromise of 1820, and thus repudiated the principle that Congress had constitutional
                    authority for prohibiting slavery in the territories. It endorsed instead the principle that the
                    slavery question should be settled by the people of the territory "subject only to the
                    Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." Those Democrats who opposed this Act united in 1854 with other groups of
                    Indiana who were opposed to the Democratic party to form the People's Party, forerunner of
                    the Republican Party in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    recognized the ability of former opponents as organizers and speakers and realized also that they
                    might attract still other Democrats to join them. Further, the Whigs in the People's Party
                    well knew that votes of insurgent Democrats had given them just the margin that meant victory in
                    1854 and might bring success again in 1856.</p>

                    also heard speakers from the Whig and Know Nothing elements of the party. Of the convention
                    appointments, however, the Democratic element received a smaller share than had been accorded them
                    two years earlier. In 1854, they received 25 of the 43 offices (or more than half) while the Whigs
                    received only 17 and the Free Soilers 1. Two years later, the Democratic insurgents were given only
                    12 appointments out of 72 (one-sixth) whereas the Whigs received at least 43 (or more than half) and

                    had the honor of acting as permanent chairman. One insurgent Democrat served on the committee on

                    electors and still another two were the final choices as electors. Of far more significance,
                    perhaps, was the fact that only two of the sixteen members of the state central committee were taken
                    from the Democratic element. Although Blake was placed on the committee, he was not chairman. That

                    been state chairman in 1854, realized the absolute necessity of a complete and efficient
                    organization. The party had then won a victory under his leadership, but Blake took his place the
                    next year. Blake was a former Democrat but the total number of that element on the committee was
                    reduced from eight to three. Moreover, in 1856, only two of the Democratic element worked on the
                    committee and the chairman was a Whig. Obviously the Whig element was. asserting itself.</p>
            <p>However, the Democratic wing of the party was permitted to have three of the nine nominees for state
                    offices, including the most important. The key position, that of candidate for governor, went to
                    Oliver P. Morton. W. R. Nofsinger was renominated for treasurer and E. W. H. Ellis was named for
                    auditor. Thus the importance of elevating their Democratic friends to posts of leadership was still
                    recognized by the Whig element although the Whigs were claiming the share of party honors due them
                    because they contributed the largest number of voters. The Democratic Party was still very strong in
                    the state and it was reclaiming some of the insurgents of 1854 by its policy of conciliation towards
                    all save the leaders who had bolted the decision of the majority.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> In view of
                    this trend, the People's Party felt it necessary to keep open the schism in the Democratic
                    Party. One method of doing this was to place Democratic insurgents on the ticket. Morton had been
                    popular enough among Democrats in his district to be suggested for the congressional nomination in
                    1854 and had gained a high reputation as a campaign orator in that year. Nofsinger had been elected
                    two years before, and Ellis, state auditor from 1850 to 1852, was a Democratic editor of long
                    experience. These nominations greatly strengthened the ticket, and it was hoped that they would
                    influence still other Democrats to join the party.</p>
            <p>Three of the candidates for Congress were also men of Democratic antecedents. Will Cumback in the
                    fourth and John U. Petit in the eleventh district were renominated, and John A. Hendricks became the
                    candidate in the third district. In the sixth district, Reuben A. Riley was the favorite of <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Only in the congressional election was the party successful. Both the national and state tickets were
                    defeated in Indiana. Of the five successful candidates for Congress only one--John U. Pettit--was
                    from the Democratic element. However, in four of the districts it was the support of former
                    Democratic voters that elected the People's Party candidates. This can be demonstrated by
                    the calculation of the approximate decrease in the strength of the Democratic vote of 1856 based on
                    estimates derived from the results in 1852. Pettit's district (eleventh) may be taken as an
                    example. The district's total vote increased by 7292 during the four years between
                    elections. Normally the vote of each party might be expected to increase in proportion to the
                    percentage of the total vote which was its share in 1852. In 1852 the Democrats polled 54% of the
                    total vote. If they had received 54% of all the votes cast in 1856, they would have had a total vote
                    of 11,716. Actually they received only 10,443 or an estimated loss of 1273 votes. When the last
                    number is subtracted from Pettit's vote presuming that 1273 Democrats or persons voting
                    that ticket in 1852 voted for Pettit in 1856), it is found that he would have had only 9962 votes or
                    less than 10,443 votes actually cast for his opponent. Thus without the 1273 votes which the
                    Democrats might normally have expected to be theirs, Pettit could not have won the election. A
                    similar calculation shows that James Wilson in the eighth, Colfax in the ninth, and Samuel A.
                    Brenton in the tenth were victorious only because of the assistance of their Democratic allies.</p>
            <p>Other evidence corroborates these conclusions. Colfax acknowledged the support of several hundred
                    Democrats, and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In spite of defeat in the national and state elections in Indiana, the party was not greatly
                    depressed. Its leaders turned almost immediately to the task of remedying weaknesses which were all
                    too evident and to preparations for 1860. As Colfax so happily phrased it, they "resolved
                    to turn a canvass into a campaign."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lack of a thorough organization was one of the serious weaknesses in 1856. Garber, E. W. H. Ellis,
                    and others urged that an organization reaching down into the townships be worked out at once and
                    that Republican clubs be encouraged to continue their meetings. They warned the party that it would
                    be fatal to delay until just before the next election.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the first step, Garber suggested that the Republican editors organize a state central committee

                    Indiana Republican Editorial Association. Garber presided and was chosen one of two vice-presidents
                    for the next year. The first president was also a former Democrat—E. W. H.
                    Ellis—and Hielscher was made treasurer. Former Whigs controlled the executive
                        committee.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>The third convention to be held within fifteen months assembled on March 4, 1858. In some respects,
                    the Democratic element did not receive as great recognition as it had previously enjoyed. They not
                    only had a smaller percentage of the committee members<hi rend="sup">20</hi> but they received a
                    lesser share of the nominees for state offices. Apparently, the Whig element was trying to enforce a
                    rotation of honors and felt that it was their turn to have the greater number of offices on the
                    ticket as well as in the convention. In 1854, they had placed only two nominees on the state ticket
                    whereas the Democratic element was given three and they were the more important offices. In 1856,
                    when there were nine state offices to be filled, the Democratic wing received three. In 1858, the
                    ratio of 1854 was actually reversed. Three former Whigs were nominated while only two former
                    Democrats received places on the ticket.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Obviously, the Democratic insurgents
                    were being relegated to a position in the party more in keeping with their numbers.</p>
            <p>Likewise in the selection of candidates for seats in Congress, the percentage granted to the
                    Democratic element declined. Whereas in 1854, there were four former Democrats among the eleven
                    candidates, in 1856, there were only three. In 1858, the percentage rose slightly but only because
                    the Republicans had but nine candidates of whom three had once been Democrats. And yet they did
                    receive some appointments which gave them considerable influence. Garber became chairman of the
                    state central committee again, thus being given the opportunity to demonstrate his ability to <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The desire to attract these "smaller political bodies" to the Republican party was
                    uppermost in the thinking of the Republicans as they drew up their platform in 1858. Although the
                    resolutions denied boldly the validity of the Supreme Court interpretation in the Dred Scott case
                    and declared that Congress did have constitutional power to prohibit slavery in the territories (the
                    Republican position since 1854), they actually promised nothing more than to use "proper
                    and constitutional means" to prevent slavery extension. Unless the Supreme Court reversed
                    the Dred Scott decision, which was not probable, even a Republican controlled Congress could not
                    prohibit slavery in the territories. So the position taken by the party was bold in words but would
                    be mild in execution. In fact, the party had not departed from the restrained phraseology of the
                    state platform of 1856.</p>

                    the anti-Lecompton Democrats whose support they desired to win. In order to obtain their aid, many
                    Republicans preferred to emphasize the denunciation of the action of the LeCompton Convention as a
                    violation of the popular sovereignty principle, rather than to talk so much of the power of Congress
                    to prohibit slavery extension. A crisis developed when Moreau. moved to amend the resolutions by

                    to the resolutions committee. This meant that it would be lost so Moreau appealed from the
                    chair's decision. Great confusion ensued. The platform submitted by the committee was
                    defended by several speakers from the Whig element, but Julian assailed it as a "milk and
                    water" affair and criticized Morton's ruling. At this juncture, as excitement
                    mounted dangerously, Morton called one of the vice-presidents to the chair and took the floor to
                    defend himself and the platform. He justified his ruling as being consistent with the rules of the
                    convention and the platform, which he emphatically declared, contained the substance if not the form
                    of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> resolutions. Finally, by means of a pointed anecdote which by inference accused Julian
                    of factiousness, he resolved the tense audience into laughter and the report of the resolutions
                    committee was adopted.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Thus Morton used the influence which his position gave
                    him and exercised his facility in debate in favor of moderation rather than radicalism on the
                    slavery issue and threw his weight on the side of those who considered it expedient to seek the aid

                    campaign he often spoke favorably of Douglas in the hope that he and his followers would join the

                    constitutional method but the surest and quickest way of stopping the spread of slavery. <hi rend="sup">46</hi> Yet they were willing to desist for a time from their attempt to win
                    recognition of this abstract principle in order to gain a Republican victory by means of the union
                    of all those opposed to the Administration. Then, too, more immediate issues were at stake such as
                    the revival of the African slave trade and the proposal that Congress enact a territorial slave
                    code.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, some of the prominent leaders from the Democratic wing of the party, remained firm
                    in their support of the original Republican principle. Garber held that Congress was "as
                    fair a representative of popular sovereignty" as any and thought that the adoption of the
                    "Douglas" principle would be "very absurd."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> He insisted that the people of a territory were "wards of Congress" and
                    that it was the duty of Congress to educate them so that their decision on the slavery question when
                    they formed a state constitution would be a "righteous" one. As always he opposed
                    any coalition which necessitated the modification of Republican principles. He welcomed all who took
                    the Republican position but protested against coalitions between "incongruous
                    elements." These, he said, might win an election, but when the legislature met, the
                    Republicans could not rely upon their temporary allies to follow Republican leadership. The result
                    was that Republicans had to bear the responsibility for laws while they lacked any real power to
                    control the legislature.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>John Young also took his stand with Garber that the time for compromise was past. He was no longer so
                    friendly to Douglas in 1860 as he had been two years earlier. Instead, he wanted now to
                    "fight under the plain Republican flag of ‘No more slave territory and no more
                    slave States’." Although he held that the Dred Scott decision should be obeyed,
                    he protested against it as a "most dangerous and wanton departure from the sacred
                    principles of liberty" and declared that he intended to "agitate till
                    death" for its reversal.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

                </quote>
            <p>Oliver P. Morton likewise clung to the doctrine of congressional intervention even after the majority
                    of the party decided to ignore it. During the campaign, he took the position that a positive law was
                    essential to the existence of slavery and that Congress could and should prohibit slavery in the
                    territories. He found constitutional authority for his view in the clause granting Congress power to
                    "make all needful rules and regulations for the government of the territory and other
                    property belonging to the <placeName>

                    acquire territory. Moreover, he thought it was the duty of the Federal Government to see to it that
                    the territories did "not contract the bad habit of slavery, polygamy or other great
                    national and social vice."<hi rend="sup">52</hi> At <placeName>

                    </placeName> he actually argued against popular sovereignty by saying that a territory could not
                    have an inherent right to self-government. If it had such a right, it was sovereign and consequently
                    had greater rights than a state which was restricted in some respects by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Constitution. He held that a territory was a dependency to be governed by Congress for
                    the common good of the whole nation.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, such views were those of a minority of the party for as election time neared the pressure
                    for the formation of a coalition with the Douglas Democrats and Know Nothings was so great that the
                    name Republican was omitted from the call for the state convention issued by the central committee
                    and state chairman Garber." Moreover, the platform omitted any mention of the principle of
                    congressional intervention. In 1854 and 1856 the platforms had indirectly endorsed the principle by
                    condemning the repeal of the <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> Compromise. In 1858, however, while explicitly asserting the doctrine in defiance of
                    the Dred Scott decision, the declaration was seriously weakened by the qualification that only
                    "proper and constitutional means" would be used in preventing the extension of
                    slavery. The greatest emphasis was placed on fulminations against the Lecompton Constitution as a
                    "gross outrage upon the rights of the people" and against the contention of
                    Southern extremists that the Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> carried slavery into the territories. The purpose was obvious. The party wished to get
                    the votes of the anti-Lecompton men. In 1860 the platform even more plainly assumed the position of
                    Douglas. No mention whatever was made of the power of Congress to legislate on slavery in the
                    territories, and the statement was made that "we believe slavery cannot exist anywhere in
                    this government unless by positive law."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> This was the premise upon
                    which the <placeName>

            <p>Again the outspoken leaders from the Democratic element bowed to the will of the Whig element. Once
                    more the need to win allies triumphed over principle in Indiana, but it was probably wiser to face
                    reality. As things stood, any attempt by Congress to prohibit slavery in a territory would be
                    declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Moreover, with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> indubitably free, the question of whether Congress should give legal protection to
                    slave property in a territory was far more pressing. And, in debate on that issue their arguments
                    would be more effective if they assumed that the Supreme Court was right. If they could take that
                    position, they could make the strong plea that since Congress lacked power to prohibit slavery in a
                    territory it like-wise had no power to give it legal protection.</p>
            <p>In selecting candidates for state offices, the party also had in mind the necessity for winning votes
                    formerly cast for the Democratic ticket. On the ticket were two former Democrats, two former Whigs,
                    a Fillmore elector of 1856, an old Liberty Party man, and a young Republican.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

            <p>It should be noted that the large Whig element and the smaller Democratic element in the party were
                    equally represented on the ticket, each having two candidates. Likewise, as in 1856, important
                    offices were given to former Democrats. Albert Lange was once more named for auditor. Oliver P.
                    Morton, the defeated gubernatorial candidate of 1856, was given second place on the ticket. A former
                    Whig, Henry S. Lane, was nominated for governor. The insistence of the Whig element on the rotation
                    of nominations is apparent in this arrangement. Morton, a former Democrat, had been accorded the
                    honor of heading the ticket in 1856, so the Whigs claimed that right in 1860. There was an
                    understanding, however, that Lane should be chosen <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator if the Republicans should win a majority in the legislature, which would, of

            <p>In the selection of candidates for Congress, also, the Whig element acknowledged the usefulness to

                    of Democrats, or men who had formerly voted Democratic tickets, supported Lincoln. Although
                    Democratic strength almost trebled in Xndiana from 1852 to 1860, the combined vote of the two
                    Democratic presidential candidates of 1860 represented a smaller percentage of the total vote than
                    Pierce had received eight years before. Obviously the Democrats had lost ground. Had they been
                    united on one candidate and had they received their normal share of the in-creased number of voters,
                    they could have won easily. It is even possible that Douglas, in spite of the split in the party,
                    could have carried the state had not several thousands of those who usually voted for Democrats cast
                    ballots for Lincoln. The chief centers of Democratic insurgency were in nineteen counties which
                    were, as Turpie pointed out, for the most part in the northern part of the state.</p>
            <p>The Republicans also carried the seven congressional districts which they had won in 1858.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> In all save the fifth district their victory was due to Democratic
                    insurgency. Of the seven men elected to Congress, two—A. G. Porter and William
                    Mitchell—were former Democrats. Yatar and Nelson of the same element were defeated. The
                    Republican con-trolled legislature sent Lane to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate and Morton became governor. Thus the first Republican governor of Indiana was
                    from the Democratic element in the party.</p>
            <p>It is evident that the Democratic element contributed much to the success of the Republicans. There
                    were always former Democrats on the tickets—state and congressional. Although the
                    proportion of the candidates granted to the group varied and tended to decrease somewhat, the
                    distribution was always fair to them. During the first years, when their share was greater, they
                    actually received extremely generous treatment from the Whig element which was large enough to
                    control the selection of candidates. Moreover, they were usually accorded important
                    offices—governor, lieu-tenant governor, treasurer, auditor. The Whigs well knew the
                    influence of the former Democrats on other waverers among their opponents. Certainly, election
                    returns revealed the wisdom of their course, for there was always a goodly number of candidates who
                    owed their success to the votes of <list type="footnotes">

                    Democratic ticket.</p>
            <p>The party was weakest in organization but even here it was the Democratic element which sensed the
                    need most acutely and which took the earliest action. Failure resulted in 1854, but two years later
                    Garber and others actually succeeded in organizing the Republican editors of the state. And it was a
                    former Democrat who started the Young Republic-an Clubs in 1860.</p>
            <p>The influence of this element on party politics is difficult to measure because its members were
                    themselves divided on the best courses to pursue. Some leaders, like Hielscher, leaned to the left
                    on the slavery question while others, such as Morton, threw their influence on the side of
                    moderation. Still others, such as Young, were willing at one time to abandon entirely the principle
                    of congressional intervention and to assume the views of Douglas. We have seen how at one time in
                    the convention of 1858 Morton had a very decided influence on the policy of the party as set forth
                    in the platform.</p>
            <p>There is no question as to the importance of the Democratic element as orators and political
                    debaters. Republican papers of the period are filled with notices of their speaking engagements. The
                    former Democrats were frequently sent to the strongly Democratic areas. They were given these
                    difficult assignments for two reasons. In the first place, they could make a stronger appeal to
                    waverers still in the Democratic party than could a former Whig or Free Soiler, and secondly, some
                    of the most able speakers in the party were in this element.</p>
            <p>The Republican party in Indiana was deeply indebted to its Democratic element from 1854 to 1860 in
                    more ways than one, and acknowledged its debt by elevating its Democratic leaders to llern
                places.</p>

            <byline>J. HARLEY NICHOLS</byline>
            <p>One of the best known families in Hoosier history was the "Bean Family," a creation
                    of Charles Bacon ("Chic") Jackson. For more than a score of years the daily doings
                    of this family took precedence in public interest over problems of state, fluctuations of the stock
                    exchange, business depressions and similar relatively unimportant matters. Thousands laughed at the
                    droll humor of Roger, admired Mrs. Bean, played with Woody and Cynthia and their dog Yank, marveled
                    at the indomitable Golduh, viewed with mixed emotions the prying impertinences of Mrs. Probe, and
                    eagerly waited the coming of Uncle Castor and Aunt Mary Bean of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mrs. Bean's Uncle Wash, the Constable of Flipsbury, Jose, the colored
                    "lormry" woman, Delbert, the spring poet, and Buck, Golduh's beau.</p>
            <p>Roger Bean was a business man. The exact nature of the business we do not know but it was important.
                    By his own careful estimate the downtown business world had been set back ten minutes by Mrs.
                    Bean's insistence that h help move the piano. No, he wouldn't help move the piano,
                    he said on another occasion, not even if it were on Golduh's foot. He suspected her of
                    being the fairy godmother of all the chores hung on his neck anyway. Didn't they know he
                    had an office downtown?</p>
            <p>Roger wasn't always attentive to questions addressed to him on weighty matters. The
                    pancakes? Why yes, they were the best he had ever tasted. He thought so well of those pancakes that
                    he was thinking seriously of recommending Golduh for citation before the league of Nations. No, he
                    wouldn't take flowers to the office. Sure he liked flowers. He liked gravy too but he
                    wouldn't carry a bowl of it down the street, Oh, well, if they could be wrapped to look
                    like spark plugs or monkey wrenches he would take about a third of them. Just a word of warning:
                    "If I come home tonight and find that jigsaw puzzle disturbed about a third of you women
                    ‘ll go to the booby hatch." As usual, Golduh had the last word: "Yeah?
                    Wal, they'd better fetch a taxi 'cause I won't walk down."</p>
            <p>Roger couldn't fool anyone, least of all Mrs. Probe. She knew the habits of the Bean family.
                    Roger wasn't smoking <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-036-3-027"/> and that meant he was going to
                    the office without his breakfast. It was a shame too—a house full of women and they
                    couldn't get a man's breakfast. Roger admitted it. It was a great injustice but he
                    would try to bear up under it. If Mrs. Probe would speak to his women folks about the matter, there
                    was a bare possibility they would try to mend their ways.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, we are permitted to look in one the doings at the office. Blinkey Burleson, who has an
                    office down the corridor from Roger's, is resolved to ignore the picture Roger sent him. It
                    might not be phoney, of course, but it was quite possible to have your picture taken with a string
                    of fish belonging to someone else. But how Blinkey chuckled when Roger was arrested for speeding.
                    Perhaps it was mean not to have identified him but he had it coming to him. To get even Roger
                    threatens to tell Mrs. Burleson that Blinkey went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> to see the world series and not on business for Roger, as Blinkey had told her.</p>
            <p>It was the entrance of Golduh, the redheaded cook from Bucyrus, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, into the Bean household that made it essentially different from that of the average
                    middle class home. Golduh celled in two accomplishments. She baked biscuits of univaled excellence
                    and she threw bricks with unerring accuracy. Admitted to the household as a temporary arrangement
                    only after various proposals of Roger, among them the hiring of an unemployed chorus girl, had been
                    rejected by Mrs. Bean, Golduh soon become indispensable. Golduh herself sensed the situation, and,
                    when Mrs. Bean urged her to take a vacation, replied: "Roger would beef like heck. You know
                    how tough he is about the cooking."</p>
            <p>Golduh took the same pride in all the housework that she took in the kitchen. It was, of course,
                    unorthodox to send the preacher to the back door but there was method in it. She wasn't
                    going to have the front porch tracked up, she told Mrs. Bean. "But you must learn to
                    exercise discrimination," Mrs. Bean explained. But Golduh was reluctant to do that. Dais
                    Fitzworthy had bought one of them bust developers and after a few days couldn't get her
                    corset on. Golduh wasn't trying to be flippant. She was never disrespectful to Mrs. Bean.
                    Golduh simply didn't understand.</p>
            <p>For that matter, the potato peelings in the Beans' garbage can may have been a trifle thick
                    but Mrs. Probe's mistake <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-036-3-028"/> was in telling Golduh so.
                    "For pity sakes, Golduh, what is the matter?" Mrs Bean exclaimed from the back
                    porch to which she had made a hurried exit from the house. "O'm gitting'
                    danged tard o' her meddlin' in my business," Golduh offered by way of
                    explanation. "How you keep out of jail is a mystery to me. You're just a police
                    character and I don't see why Mrs. Bean keeps you," Mrs. Probe shouted by way of
                    rebuttal. "Come, Joey, don't pay any attention to the hussey," she said
                    to her rooster, who somehow always managed to get a ringside seat on the fence.
                    "I'm not afraid of her," she confided to Henry, who, wholly oblivious to
                    what had hapened, was immersed in his mystery story.</p>
            <p>Golduh's reputation for thoroughness was soon established in the neighborhood.
                    "Buddy, when Gol gits through with ya yer embammed. I dunno wotchir up to but whotever
                    'tis don't do it," the ash-man warned the meter man, who, unmindful of
                    the danger to his health and happiness, was proceeding to turn off the gas at the Bean home while
                    the Beans were on a vacation.</p>
            <p>The same scientific methods were advocated by Golduh in domestic affairs that she practiced in
                    foreign relations. In a case involving no less a personage than Roger, she rendered an <hi rend="i">obiter dictum</hi> on the handling of husbands in general: "Oh dear! I wish I could
                    depend on Roger when I entertain," Mrs. Bean confided to Golduh in tones of utter despair.
                    "O'll tell ya why ya caint," Golduh responded. "How
                    far'd I git if I told them tradesmen: 'Oh dear! O'11 jist be put out if
                    yer not here with my order?' Wal, husbands aint so durned different. Yotta say jist two
                    words: 'Be here’ then tell the flat world he better had. Aint it so? Huh? Now
                    aint it?"</p>
            <p>It was a severe blow to the majesty of the law when Buck, the brakeman, superseded Clarence, the
                    policeman in Golduh's affections. It was Clarence's fault thought, for Golduh had
                    confided to him one evening on their way home from the guild that her greatest ambition was to have
                    a home of her own and not have to work for other people. Mrs. Probe couldn't understand it.
                    Was it alimony that he had to pay to a former wife on the high price of furniture that prevented him
                    leading Golduh to the altar? she asked Clarence one evening as he passed her house on his beat.
                    Clarence was inclined to blame Golduh. "I positively won't <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-036-3-029"/> marry you this year," he claimed she had written to him the
                    previous Christmas while visiting her folks in Bucyrus.</p>
            <p>Buck, on the other hand, had a way with the women. "End o' th' line!
                    Everybody out ! Hi, Gol ! Why, I'd rather see your red head than th' headlight on
                    th' pay car," he greeted Golduh one evening while on a brief leave from his train.
                    No, he didn't mind in the least the dough on Golduh's hands. He rather liked to
                    look like a leopard.</p>
            <p>Golduh for once was subdued. "Why, Golduh, most girls would he stirred pink by all the nice
                    things he says about you," Mrs. Bean told her by way of reproof for her apparent
                    indifference. "Yes and look forward to bein' married on a railroad bridge and
                    takin' our honeymoon on a handcar," Golduh retorted. Golduh liked Buck though. He
                    could be train caller on her railroad, she told Floss Avringhan at the Guild.</p>
            <p>In accordance with the practice of the time, Golduh accepted lecture engagements. Unlike Mrs. Bean
                    who talked to the Breakfast Club gratis, Golduh was going to charge for her lectures. It might be
                    unethical but there were precedents. There was Bryan for instance: "He does it, donty? Huh?
                    You tell'em he does," Golduh reminded Mrs. Bean.</p>
            <p>Serious repercussions in the labor world resulted from Colduh assuming new responsibilities, the most
                    important of which was the hiring of Jose, a colored woman, to take over the laundry work.
                    "Says which?" was Jose's initial response to all questions. If pressed
                    for a more definite commitment she usually responded: "Yo all bettah ast Mis Gol."
                    When Golduh desired to know what she had done with her "pickup" she replied:
                    "Ah's jis plannin' my work, thinkin' it out like." She
                    would have Golduh know if it didn't discommode her too much that there was marked
                    similarity between her coming and going and that of the preacher: "Yo all doan tale him
                    he's late—he tries to keep yo souls clean an' Ah tries to keep yo
                    cloves clean."</p>
            <p>Uncle Wash, as were Uncle Castor and Aunt Mary, was a welcome guest in the Bean home. The constable
                    dropped in at frequent and irregular intervals while the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> folk made a more extended visit once a year. "Howdy, Goldy, folks all
                    well?" Uncle Wash inquired on an occasion by way of placing his name in the pot.
                    "Ye guides, look who's here," Golduh greeted him from the head of the
                    receiving line. <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-036-3-030"/> "Wal, park your chew an'
                    c'min. We'll eat as soon as Mrs. Bean comes."</p>
            <p>In the kitchen, the exchange continued with Golduh busy with the meal and Uncle Wash occupying a
                    corner by the range, his chair leaning against the wall and his feet in a somewhat exalted position:
                    "By cracky, I've had a siege since I wuz here last—sumpin like
                    th' quinzy." "Un-hu yaint livin' right. Swotcha git."
                    "The doc says it wuz brung on by havin' my whiskers cut." "Zat
                    why yer wearin' that tie counta th' quinzy, heh ?" "Yep I haint
                    had th' quinzy since I put it on." "Ye guides, I'd ruther have
                    th' quinzy."</p>
            <p>At one time, we begin to fear that Uncle Wash has designs on the conjugal happiness of Henry. Things
                    take a turn for the better, however, when Washburn tells Lavina that if Joey were his rooster he
                    would teach him to chew tobacco and to spit. We are further reassured when Uncle Wash, in answer to
                    Golduh's earnest solicitations, assures that lady that his frequent trips to the city were
                    notivated by business considerations: "Pretty much a matter of business, by gum, pretty
                    much a matter of business. Five cents per mile and fifty cents for dinner." The business
                    must have been fairly lucrative for to our own certain knowledge he came to town twice on a hog
                    truck. His efficiency as an officer, however, was in nowise impaired. In answer to Roger's
                    question as to whether Flipsbury was as wide open as ever, he entered an emphatic denial:
                    "No, siree, I got her well in hand. By cracky, she's as tight as a drum."
                    "Yep, I 'spect he's even closed the barbershops," Golduh
                    observes as she transfers another pancake to Uncle Wash's plate.</p>
            <p>As befitted the personages, the reception accorded the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> folk was a little bit different: "Now—there's two gittin
                    outa th' taxi—looky who," Golduh exclaimed excitedly to Mrs. Bean after
                    both had hastened to the window. "Oh—bless his heart! Now Golduh, if I catch you
                    not being nice to him, I'll send you away. Uncle Castor, you darling! Why didn't
                    you write? Where's Aunt Mary? Golduh come take Uncle Castor's coat and
                    hat." "Hi siay, Sylvia, 'ows th' geryl? It's bully to
                    see you. 'Owdy Goldy, the bally old nuisance is back again." "Aw swell.
                    We wuz jis wishin’ fer ya, hopin' ya'd stay all summer. Ritzy
                    ol' club ya got here." (This <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-036-3-031"/> last remark
                    referred to Uncle Castor's cane). The words of welcome for Mobile, the colored chauffeur,
                    were uttered by Jose: "Doan y'all look at me liak yo's company. Git
                    yo'self a handful o' dese valises."</p>
            <p>Neighborhood excitement over the arrival of Uncle Castor is followed by speculation. Did he lose his
                    job or just run out on it, Mrs. Probe wondered. Henry couldn't leave his job and go
                    gallavanting around the country. Like as not Uncle Castor couldn't afford it either.
                    Golduh, too, was mystified. Why didn't he drive his own car or at least hire a white man?
                    There were so many of them out of work. There was one thing certain: If she were Mrs. Bean, she
                    wouldn't let him use one of her good napkins to polish them durned old shinny clubs. Roger
                    liked to play golf with Uncle Castor, but wearing a sweater was quite a different matter. He would
                    stand for his initials on his shirt and baby ribbon on his pajamas, but he wasn't going to
                    look like "a Pomeranian pup."</p>
            <p>Despite the difference in environmental influences, there was mutual understanding between Uncle Wash
                    and Uncle Castor. "Howdy, Wash, you old jail bird, hout on bail, hi suppose," the
                    Bostonian greeted the Flipsburyite during the progress of a cordial and extended handshake at a
                    pre-arranged meeting at the Bean home. Uncle Wash returned the volley: "By cracky, never
                    thought Aunt Mary'd tolerate ya this long. Howdy, you old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> dude. Tryin' to evade the law, I reckon." Nor were their interests
                    and habits essentially different—at the Follies Uncle Castor would have liked a cigarette
                    while Uncle Wash was just dying for a chew.</p>
            <p>Interspersed with the doings of the grownups were the play and chatter of the children. Woody was
                    left on the Beans' doorstep while Cynthia was adopted into the family after a harrying
                    experience with Harry the Rat. This last was accomplished not without protest from Mrs. Probe, who,
                    while confessing that it was none of her business, thought it wasn't right to bring up the
                    child in an atmosphere of brick throwing, vulgar language and downright mismanagement.</p>
            <p>It was the grownups and not the youngsters whose welfare was endangered, however. "Daddy
                    Woger" is going to hear from Cynthia "when he dits home, by tracky," and
                    Woody informs Golduh that he isn't going to have his mail <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-036-3-032"/> (this particular letter was from Peggy)) put in any old pantry. But
                    even Woody must have seen the logic in Golduh's retort: "Ye guides! It's
                    hid there less than in any place else. If I was going to tell someone to meet ya, I'd send
                    'em to th' pantry, big boy." It is true, of course, that Roger was
                    offered the czardom of the "Northside Clippers," but the proposition carried with
                    it the obligation to provide the uniforms for the ball team to which Woody belonged and we do not
                    wonder that Roger desired to sleep on the offer.</p>
            <p>The children grew and in due time Woody graduated from high school. "For pity sakes! I
                    can't hardly believe it," Mrs. Bean said, half to herself and half to Golduh, as
                    she looked down the street from the front porch of the Bean home. "Tain't nobody
                    but Woody," Golduh replied. "But just think, he will soon be in college,"
                    Mrs. Bean explained. "Tain't nothin' to be ashamed of. Yotta be glad
                    tain't th' penitenshury," Golduh offered by way of consolation.</p>
            <p>Did Woody graduate from college? Were Buck and Golduh finally married? If so, was the wedding formal
                    and was Mrs. Probe invited? Does Joey still defy the mortality tables for <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName> Red roosters? If not what was the manner of his going and what were the funeral
                    arrangements? How does Yank amuse himself, now that the children are grown, or has he had his day
                    and gone where all good dogs go? Are Clarence and Uncle Wash still guardians of the law and does the
                    latter's bag of "ladyslipper" have a zipper on it? Did Roger weather the
                    depression and what is his attitude toward the New Deal? Is Mrs. Bean as charming as ever? Has she
                    had her hair bobbed? Does she use rouge and fingernail-polish? These and many other things relating
                    to the recent doings of the Bean family we would like to know. The answers lie buried with
                    "Chic" Jackson.</p>
            <p>Charles Bacon ("Chic") Jackson, the creator of the comic strip, <hi rend="i">The
                        Bean Family</hi>, was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on New Year's Eve of 1876. He attended the <placeName>

                    </placeName> schools but withdrew before completing his high school course. He worked successively
                    in a shoe factory, grocery store, printing office, bolt factory, maleable iron works, glass factory
                    and, at last attained what to him seemed the zenith of his ambitions, a position as illustrator and
                    front page cartoonist <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-036-3-033"/> on the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> later on the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi> into which the <hi rend="i">News</hi> was absorbed.</p>
            <p>While employed by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers, he became acquainted with Margaret Wagner of Springport, Indiana, who also
                    was employed by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi>. To Miss Wagner, he sold the "blue-sky proposition" of
                    becoming Mrs. Jackson, as he said in speaking humorously of his life, and they were married in 1902.
                    "While I have been busy raising the Bean family, Mrs. Jackson has very successfully reared
                    our two fine boys," he once remarked years later.</p>
            <p>A few years after their marriage, the Jacksons went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> where "Chic" spent a year at. the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi>, at first doing Sunday feature illustrating and later developing <hi rend="i">The Bean Family</hi>. This last feature first appeared in the <hi rend="i">Star</hi> of April
                    22, 1913, the first drawing, appropriately enough, showing Roger and Mrs. Bean alighting from the
                    train at the Union Station preparatory to settling in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. During Jackson's later years, the strip was syndicated and appeared in other
                    journals besides the <hi rend="i">Star</hi>.</p>
            <p>The vast popular interest in the doings of the Beans was made manifest by the amount of "fan
                    mail" Jackson received. Said the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi> at the time of his death: "Let Chic make the smallest kind of a
                    mistake and he heard about it. He precipitated a small flury when he inadvertently left the stripes
                    from Golduh's stockings one day. One person, a woman, called him to time for having Mrs.
                    Bean serve gingerbread too late in the season. Thousands of letters came to him from all over the
                    country to point out any small discrepancy and other thousands wrote just because they wanted him to
                    know the enjoyment they got from his strip." A favorite method of expressing appreciation
                    was by sending bricks for Golduh to throw. These were often accompanied by humorous suggestion for
                    their use.</p>
            <p>Among Jackson's cherished recollections was one of a call that James Whitcomb Riley made in
                    1915. The poet was infirm and unable to leave his car, but sent his chauffeur to the second floor of
                    the <hi rend="i">Star</hi> building with a request that "Chic" come down to the
                    parked automobile. There Riley told him of the enjoyment he had derived from the characters
                    displayed in the strip and of the pleasure the good wholesome humor had afforded him. When the poet
                        <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-036-3-034"/> died the following year "Chic" was deeply
                    grieved and expressed his loss in a cartoon representing Roger Bean under a tree reading
                    "The Raggedy Man" to Woody, the Caption being: "But His Songs Go On
                    Forever."</p>
            <p>Jackson had often expressed a desire that he might live to see Woody through college. This desire was
                    not realized for, on June 3, 1934, a short time before the close of Woody's Freshman year,
                    Mr. Jackson died at the result of a heart attack. The deep sense of loss of the many who followed
                    his strip was appropriately expressed in a drawing by William Heitman in the <hi rend="i">Star</hi>
                    of June 5, of that year, representing the characters in <hi rend="i">The Bean Family</hi> with
                    downcast countenances gathered around the vacant chair and drawingboard of their departed friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Bean Family</hi> was not an ordinary comic strip. To its development Jackson brought
                    a deep insight into human nature, based on a broad knowledge of the workaday world. His aim, as he
                    himself expressed it, was to picture human beings naturally on the theory that there was enough
                    humor and fascination in everyday life without straining to create either. That his characters
                    seemed as real as flesh and blood people is proof that he succeeded.</p>

            <byline>HARRY O. GARMAN</byline>
            <p>This is the story of the actual experience of a student from a pioneer family of Indiana coming from
                    LaPorte County to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1897 as a student in the Short Course in Agriculture at Purdue University, and
                    remaining to graduate in the Course in Civil Engineering in 1902.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> At the age of
                    sixteen years, I came to Purdue with another short-course student, my room-mate, named Wade Haines
                    from Hudson Lake near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Carlisle</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Even though northern Indiana was settled later than southern Indiana, it was the first part of the
                    State to be seen by white man—in 1673 by Marquette, then by LaSalle in 1679, both
                    traveling over the Sauk Trail (and continental divide) and across lands that afterwards became the
                    home farms of the Garman and Haines families.</p>
            <p>We came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> over the Monon Railroad, which had no permanent passenger station in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> at that time (1897), but had leased for passenger station purposes an old store room
                    located, on the southwest corner of Fifth and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> streets, one block from the court house square.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> On the way through
                    the Kankakee marsh south of Wanatah, the whistle blew for a station. The brakeman, in his blue
                    uniform, stuck his head out to see if there were any passengers on the gravel platform, and his blue
                    cap with gold braid blew off into the marsh grass. He immediately pulled the signal cord for the
                    train to stop and back up for his hat much to the disgust of the other members of the train crew.
                    The town of Monon was a point for changing engines and it was during this interval that the
                    passengers with money went into the restaurant for a railroad lunch of coffee, sandwiches and pie,
                    while we poor farmer boys at our lunches out of paste-board shoe boxes—lunches prepared
                    by our good farm mothers.</p>
            <p>We found a room in Snoddyville, adjoining the campus on the west, and two and a half blocks south of
                    State Street. The name of the family was Turner. It was made up of <list type="footnotes">

                    house, there was a boarding table where several of the football team ate. When meals were called a
                    football rush was made. There was plenty of food, but the young men enjoyed a little shoving. This
                    was the first time I ever heard dirty stories at the table, which had to be told intermittently
                    during the intervals when the old maid waitress was in the kitchen loading her tray for more
                    service. Although the food was served on the table in large dishes, these had to be refilled. Many
                    times the sliced bread was "dealt" from the end of the table like cards from a
                    deck. We all became expert catchers, and learned how to avoid bread-crumbs in our eyes. The Turner
                    women frowned on all this, but they wanted to keep their table, filled with boarders.</p>
            <p>At this time, there was an old steel through-truss bridge over the <placeName>

                    </placeName> River at Main Street (washed out by the 1913 flood). The electric railway track was
                    carried over the river with a supplemental steel truss on the north side of the roadway and
                    continued on to West <placeName>

                    levee is higher, being built up after the 1913 flood. On the old levee, there was one sidewalk in
                    1897. It was on the south side and made of a mixture of tar and gravel worn to holes, which made it
                    difficult to walk on after dark with no street lights.</p>
            <p>In the short course in agriculture, I first learned that a mule is a half-breed, a cross between the
                    donkey and the horse. I learned this by asking a question during a lecture on horses by a Mr.
                    Hussellman, a special lecturer and practical farmer. When I asked the question, he at first thought
                    I was joking him; but when he saw that I was in earnest he asked the class to be quiet while he
                    explained the matter to me in a kindly manner. The members of the class were not so considerate as
                    the lecturer, and, until the end of the eleven weeks course, scarcely a day passed that someone did
                    not call to me across the campus asking if I was acquainted with mules. Even electrical, civil, and
                    mechanical engineers, who learned in their boarding houses about the episode in that class-room,
                    would call to me asking about mules.</p>
            <p>At the end of this short course in agriculture in March, 1897, those of us who were in the course
                    ("short-horns") <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-036-3-037"/> returned to our farm homes.
                    In the following September, I returned to Purdue University and entered the four year course in
                    engineering as a freshman. I roomed with a Preston family on the southwest corner of University and
                    Second streets in Snoddyville, two blocks north of State Street and adjoining the old campus on the
                    west. During this school year, the ordinary experiences of a freshman fell to my lot.</p>
            <p>September, 1898, was the beginning of the sophomore year and of my life in the old four-story brick
                    dormitory yet standing and now used for class-room purposes. This dormitory was lighted with gas,
                    but there were no toilets in the building and no running water in any room. On each floor was a
                    bathroom with a zinc bathtub, almost always dirty, and an old marble washstand, not often used. In
                    each bed-room was a washstand, a coarse china wash-bowl and large pitcher. On the floor at the side
                    was a sheetiron slop-pail supposed to be emptied each morning. The toilets for the dormitory were in
                    a low, one story brick building, located about forty yards west of the dormitory and surrounded by a
                    small grove of pine trees. There were no sewers in West <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the gay nineties. Only a few of the better homes had running water and the sewage
                    was discharged into dry wells. On dark nights boys in the dormitory dared not make a run for the
                    toilet, because there was no sidewalk, and there was danger of colliding with a pine tree or running
                    against the flat brick wall. On moonlight nights or during thunder storms, it was easy to locate the
                    building. The school provided the furniture and the naked room. The students furnished the springs,
                    bedding and linen.</p>
            <p>Since I must provide my own bedding, my mother, on the home farm near Rolling <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, provided me among other things with a tick full of new goose feathers and a large tick
                    for straw. I never slept on bed springs until after living in the dormitory for about one year. Then
                    I bought an abandoned set of bed springs for twenty-five cents—a real luxury.</p>
            <p>The feathers in my feather-tick were picked by my mother from our geese on the farm which I caught
                    and held for her. I can always remember how the geese would give one squawk with each hand full of
                    feathers. We picked the ganders first because they protested the most, and I had to <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-036-3-038"/> hold their heads while they were being picked to keep them from
                    pinching mother. I am reminded that the rule for many years, for the collection of taxes, has been,
                    and is yet, to adopt a system of tax collection that "gets the most feathers with the least
                    squawking."</p>
            <p>I went to school with two trunks, one for my clothes and one for my bedding including the feather bed
                    which had to be compressed to close the trunk. Upon my arrival in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> about noon, I engaged a man with a one-horse cracky-wagon to haul the two trunks to the
                    "west side" and help me carry them to my room on the fourth floor. The lower
                    class-men had to take the upper floors while the upper clasamen had the choice of rooms on the lower
                    floors. Of course there were no elevators, but running up and down stairs was not tiresome for farm
                    boys. In the afternoon I took my large straw tick and went with the man who operated the one-horse
                    cracky-wagon to the strawstack on the University Farm on the south side of the West State Street
                    (now nearly opposite the beautiful dormitories for girls). Here (by permission) we stuffed the tick
                    with straw until it was about three feet thick. We then loaded it on the cracky-wagon, hauled it to
                    the dormitory and carried it up to the fourth floor. The stairways were narrow and we had difficulty
                    making the turns. When in my room, I paid the dray-man for his services and he left. Then I sewed
                    the tick shut with some strong twine and rolled it into the bedroom and up on to the cross slats of
                    the bedstead. I placed the tick of feathers on top, then the sheets and quilts, and I was ready for
                    a school year. By this time, the bed was about four feet thick on top of the slats. I could not get
                    "into" or on top of the bed from the floor so I stood on one of the trunks and
                    jumped over on top of the bed. I knew from experience that it was necessary to break a new straw bed
                    straight down and keep it level so it would not develop a slope which would make it difficult to
                    remain in the bed.</p>
            <p>Towards evening my new and strange room-mate came, a boy named Thaddius Perry. We each had separate
                    bedrooms with a common study room. During the course of our first conversation, I noticed his eyes
                    wander over to my bedroom door and remain fixed for a moment. Then he asked what I had in there and
                    I told him it was my bed. He asked permission to look at it, and I said
                    "certainly." Then he broke <pb n="221" id="VAA4025-036-3-039"/> out into a loud
                    laugh. I asked him what was funny about my bed and he said it was the first straw bed he had ever
                    seen and ventured the statement that it was the only straw bed in the building if not the only one
                    of its kind in town. I countered with the suggestion that there might be several others in the
                    building like it.</p>
            <p>After supper as I sat visiting with my new room-mate, we had an unusual number of callers, strangers
                    to me who were other roomers in the dormitory. I thought at first that they were just friendly and
                    wanted to be neighborly, but, in each case, after a few pleasant words about where we came from and
                    the school we were in, the conversation always got around to my high straw bed and a request to see
                    it. I soon learned that I was harboring a curiosity. I asked my room-mate how they knew about it,
                    and he replied that after the first caller it went by word of mouth all over the building. It was a
                    source of inner embarrassment to me to be the curiosity of the building, and as soon as I could get
                    money enough together I bought for a nominal amount the abandoned set of bed springs mentioned
                    above, and a mattress that was stored in the basement.</p>
            <p>In January of 1899, I "took down" with a serious case of pleurisy and pneumonia. It
                    became necessary to go to the St. Elizabeth Hospital, then the only one in the city. There were no
                    ambulances in town so it was a matter of riding on a stretcher in the police patrol-wagon or in the
                    dead-wagon of an undertaker, both horse-drawn conveyances, from the dormitory to the hospital. Most
                    of the streets were covered with muddy gravel. The mud had recently frozen and the wheels had steel,
                    not rubber tires.</p>
            <p>Well, do I remember riding flat on my back in the dead-wagon, my temperature 104 degrees, the horses
                    walking, the steel tires jolting over the rough frozen streets and my doctor following in a horse
                    and buggy just behind. I was delerious by the time I got to the hospital, my first experience in any
                    kind of a hospital, and the Catholic sister sat by the side of my bed and read prayers while I
                    insisted on telling her farm stories. Some of my tales made it nearly impossible for her to keep a
                    serious face while reading the prayers. My hospital experience, which extended over a period of
                    several months, delayed my graduation from 1901 to 1902. I played <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-036-3-040"/> in the Purdue Band from 1901 to 1902, and became a member of the engineering faculty in
                    September, 1902.</p>
            <p>The people of the city and other students of the University had a mortal fear of the men in the
                    dormitory. We had a yell that went something like this:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="c">A—O—D—D—H—2—O!</p>
                        <p rend="c">DORMITORY! DORMITORY!</p>
                        <p rend="c">DOE—SEE—DOE!</p>
                    </quote> The first four letters (AODD meant Ancient Order Dormitory Devils; "H<hi rend="sub">2</hi>O" meant water. The three words of the last line had no significance
                    but were used to force a rhyme. Several students who came to visit the dormitory were undressed and
                    painted with shoe polish while others were "ducked" with all their clothing on in
                    the old zinc bath tubs, all of which tended to keep up the reputation of the dormitory for being a
                    dangerous place. Everything was done in the spirit of good sport, however; there was nothing
                    vicious. Several of us in the dormitory belonged to the Sunday School class at the Trinity Methodist
                    Church on the East Side where I played a trumpet in the orchestra. Some of the church people
                    wondered how such nice boys could live in such a terrible place.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1904, I began "keeping company" with one of the girls in the
                    Sunday School named Ethel Elfride Hanly, and we were soon engaged to be married. In November, 1904,
                    her father, J. Frank Hanly, was elected Governor of the state of Indiana in the Republican landslide
                    by which Theodore Roosevelt retained the presidency of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. On December 19, 1904, Miss Hanly and I were married in the Trinity Methodist Church.
                    All of my students were invited and came in a body dressed in dark clothes and each wearing a
                    beautiful red carnation, Mr. Hanly's flower. The Governor-elect gave his daughter in
                    marriage. The people of the city rushed the doors until the church was packed with people standing
                    in the aisles on the first floor and in the galleries. The city police had to close the church doors
                    until after the ceremony and then clear the traffic on Sixth and Ferry streets before we could get
                    away to the home of my bride's parents, at the corner of South Ninth and Owen streets,
                    where we had a wedding breakfast. We expected to leave at noon on a honeymoon trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but, at the appointed hour, <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-036-3-041"/> students and other
                    friends gathered around the house and insisted on taking us, bride and groom, to the railroad
                    station in a buggy drawn by two mules in tandum with postillions. We then delayed our going until
                    the four o'clock train hoping the boys would go away, but instead they built bon-fires in
                    the snow, sent for their meals and settled down for a siege. I had heard rumors of kidnaping and was
                    afraid to leave the house. At three in the afternoon, a committee of students came to the front door
                    and promised to protect me against kidnaping if I would ride with my bride in the buggy drawn by the
                    mules. We finally compromised and I was drawn to the station by the mules and my bride rode in a
                    two-horse carriage behind me. There were about three hundred students and other people around the
                    carriages when we, including the Governor and his wife, started from the house to the Big Four
                    Railway station. The crowd kept gathering numbers, as the procession marched toward the station
                    until the mob, or so it appeared, took the entire width of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> Street on which the procession had turned at Ninth Street. At the railroad station,
                    there was a mass of people and the carriages were driven to the side of the train. We were helped
                    into our Pullman car and the doors were locked. We were out of the hands of the paraders and in a
                    few moments the Big Four train was on its way to Kankakee, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, where we transferred to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Central and were at last headed for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. We had planned a quiet home wedding, but on account of changed circumstances we were
                    projected into exciting situations almost beyond our control.</p>
            <p>The cost of living at Purdue was much lower during my student days than it is now. Good board could
                    then be had at many places in private homes at $2.00 per week, three meals per day, seven
                    days in the week. The total cost of schooling for one year, ranged from $400.00 to
                    $600.00 per year from 1897 to 1902 for those who did not earn a part of their expenses.</p>
            <p>Inter-collegiate sports were not well organized then. They were in the hands of the students, little
                    supervised by the faculty, and nearly always operated on a deficit. I did not go to games when a
                    student, because I had no money to purchase tickets. The football field was then called Stuart Field
                    and <pb n="224" id="VAA4025-036-3-042"/> was located east of the present Armory. Music Hall now
                    stands about in the middle of the old gridiron.</p>
            <p>The "Bell" of which students now display a replica on rubber wheels at football
                    games, was first located on top of the old powerhouse. This was replaced by what is now called the
                    Education building (B7). The old engineer, named Bianky, would ring this bell at 6:00 A.M. for the
                    dormitory boys to get out of bed; then, at 7:00 P.M. for the boys to begin studying; and at 10:00
                    P.M. for them to cease studying and go to bed. Many times I have walked into the boiler room just
                    before time for the bell to ring and found Mr. Bianky hanging on the bell-rope with his face towards
                    the clock waiting for the exact moment to swing the full weight of his body on that rope to call
                    students to their duties and give to others the time of day. The present use of this bell in noisy
                    victory demonstrations is a far cry from its original use to call sleepy boys to dress for
                    breakfast, to study or finally to rest and peaceful slumber. When I see the old bell at a football
                    game, I feel that it has been drafted into a service, quite foreign to its original use.</p>
            <p>There were no motion or sound pictures then. The show houses were called Opera Houses. Real shows
                    came to them and it cost real money to see them, so ordinary students did not see many. Play or
                    recreation was considered bad—a waste of time when there was so much work to do. There
                    were only a few dances in those days, the best of them given by fraternities. Most of the students
                    came from homes where they were taught that the common dance was an institution of Satan. The
                    fraternity dances were well chaperoned and ranked high socially, but there were not many of them.
                    The city girls would give almost anything they had to "rate" one of these
                    fraternity dances. My father-in-law to-be told his daughter to keep away from those Purdue students,
                    but, since I was on the teaching staff, she argued with him that i was not a student, so we were
                    free to meet each other and were later married as related above.</p>
            <p>Students had to make most of their own entertainment. They assembled in the room of some congenial
                    spirit bringing with them their favorite instruments—guitars, mandolins, violins and
                    horns. Since I played a cornet in the band and in the Sunday School, I contributed music on the
                    cornet at our impromptu gatherings. Many of the boys were good singers. <pb n="225" id="VAA4025-036-3-043"/> The music could be heard for a block each way from the house and there
                    was no liquor used in the party. Once I roomed where there was a fine old black walnut foot-pedal,
                    bellows organ. One of my roommates, Steigley of LaPorte, played and sang with a beautiful tenor
                    voice. When we began to play and sing, our rooms were soon filled with other singing and playing
                    students.</p>
            <p>Once while rooming in the dormitory, I took my cornet with me to the room of another student named
                    Endicott. He played a large double B base horn, comparable to one of the great modern helicons. We
                    had to play some music that we both knew, so we fished out an old Methodist hymn-book at about ten
                    o'clock in the morning, forgetting that classes were in session on the campus while we were
                    in the dormitory with the windows open. We played "Rock of Ages," "Nearer
                    My God to Thee" and "Jesus Lover of My Soul." The next morning we each
                    received a nice note from President Stones asking us not to play during class periods in the daytime
                    nor during study hours in the evening.</p>
            <p>Our only home trips were at Christmas, because of the expense and because the faculty frowned on
                    excursions from the campus. These trips disturbed the minds of the students for about two weeks
                    before the trip, thinking about going; and about two weeks after returning, when we did thinking
                    that was not about our lessons. There was in addition the matter of over-eating and indigestion, due
                    to change in menu, not to mention exposure to measles, influenza, chicken pox, <hi rend="i">et
                        cetera</hi>.</p>
            <p>Some of the old buildings that I loved are now gone from the campus. For instance where the
                    wood-frame gymnasium (a barn Iike structure) stood, we have the Memorial Gymnasium (B 16) in memory
                    of the terrible football wreck on the railroad tracks in <placeName>

                    with perspiration. The old brick Science Hall, part two-story and part one-story, was replaced with
                    the Stanley Coulter Hall (B 11). The Ladies Hall, a two story brick building, was replaced with the

                    friends, two and three couples in the room at one time with a chaperon next door. No real

            <p>The original agricultural experiment station, a brick two-story building, was replaced with the
                    present Agricultural Experiment Station (A 1). Here most of the experiments not requiring large
                    spaces, were performed. I shall always remember the smells of dead horse meat, carbolic acid, ether
                    and chloroform. Likewise I cannot forget the barking and moaning of dogs undergoing
                    "professional operations" by students in the classes nor the squawking of young
                    roosters passing into capon-hood.</p>
            <p>We killed and cut up our horses in class in a small wood-frame barn which has been replaced with the
                    Horticultural Building (A 4) on S. Marstellar Street. I never had a heart for seeing anything killed
                    and I usually remained in another room when the animal was being dispatched. It was nearly too much
                    for me to help arrange the fresh bed of straw for the horse to fall on when shot. The poor old
                    animal who had earned a better end than this was shot with a twenty-two rifle, held in the hands of
                    the professor (a Dr. Bitting). The muzzle of the gun was poised about four inches from the forehead
                    of the horse so that the professor would be sure and not miss the intended victim and hit some of
                    the students.</p>
            <p>The entire student body of Purdue University numbered about 700 students at the end of the century.
                    The faculty and student body knew each other by name or by sight. A chapel meeting was held on the
                    fourth floor of the Main Building, now University Hall (B 6) every Wednesday morning. Attendance was
                    compulsory for freshmen and sophomores and also for faculty members. The standard routine of the
                    chapel exercises was reading from the Scriptures, the Lord's Prayer repeated by all
                    (Presbyterian version) and announcements of general interest. The exercises were accompanied by some
                    special music or some special speaker.</p>
            <p>I remember when a noted group of visitors came to the University and ended up in the Chapel
                    exercises. In the party were former Secretary of the State John W. Foster and ex-President Benjamin
                    Harrison. Foster was the speaker of the occasion. He read from some manuscript that he had prepared
                    years back and his message did not fit the occasion. Both Foster and Harrison were aged, corpulent
                    and bearded <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-036-3-045"/> men. Foster could scarcely keep awake while reading
                    his paper and Harrison accompanied by several students fell fast asleep. The students did not object
                    to the extra two hours of chapel because it was easier than class work.</p>
            <p>James H. Smart was Purdue's president and the vice-president was Winthrop E. Stone,
                    professor of chemistry. After I entered the University, I found President Smart liked to meet
                    students. He had a rather imposing, but friendly appearance. He was very near sighted, had wide
                    untrimmed sideburns, and wore nose-rider glasses tethered with a silk ribbon. When a student came to
                    President Smart's office, he would rise to his feet, extend a hand of welcome and look the
                    student straight in the eye. Because of near-sightedness, President Smart would approach his caller
                    until their noses were only about six inches apart. Even though the meeting was most friendly, the
                    student left with the feeling that he had been "backed out of the office."
                    Vice-President Stone, a brother of the associate justice of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Supreme Court, was a warm hearted man with a cool exterior. He appeared to like me from
                    the first time we met. The fact that I was a poor boy from the farm, did not wear the latest cut
                    clothes and did not go to dances, seemed to make him like me more.</p>
            <p>A popular mathematics professor was a quaker named Moses Cobb Stevens. He had a full, untrimmed, red
                    beard streaked with grey. He was easy with his students and did not give many examinations as he
                    admitted that he did not like to grade papers. When possible, no engineers were assigned to his
                    classes. He had most of the girls and the boys not in the engineering courses. I was assigned to his
                    class because of a schedule conflict, but I enjoyed him and the work. He was so deaf that he could
                    only hear part of the questions the class asked—it seemed only such questions as he
                    wished to hear. The class conversed openly in his presence while he was lecturing. This would
                    occasionally develop into a comedy and loud laughter would result which he could see. This would
                    induce the remark from him that he did not know he had said anything funny. Then there was more
                    laughter. Such a condition developed to the extent that students not enrolled wih him would visit
                    the Stevens class in mathematics just to see the fun. He was, however, quick to spot a visitor. Then
                    he would stop the class work and begin an interview <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-036-3-046"/> with the
                    visitor in an attempt to discover his reasons for wishing to visit a class in mathematics. This
                    always developed into a comic situation. Personally, I do not think that Professor Stevens was as
                    deaf as he pretended to be. I think that, behind his red whiskers, he had about as much fun as we
                    did. He and his wife had both been married before and both had children by their former marriages.
                    Their own marriage had been blessed with a daughter Martha, who, now grown to young womanhood, was
                    the life of any party. A boy of one of the previous unions married a step-sister of the other
                    earlier marriage, there being no blood relationship. The house was large and all were Quakers and
                    there appeared to be perfect peace. Students in speaking of this happy family said that there were
                    included in the family "his children, her children and their children." This
                    family record would furnish an interesting subject for a genealogist.</p>
            <p>T. G. Alford, another professor of mathematics, was one of God's noblemen, always thorough
                    and kindly in class. On Sundays, he wore a long broadcloth Prince Albert coat that came down about
                    to his knees. Every Sunday afternoon, he met a large group of young men in a room in the old
                    Agricultural Experiment Station building on the south side of State Street. There he discussed the
                    Bible with them. His wish was to keep the boys in the Church and prevent "back
                    sliding" when they broke home ties and came to college. He did a great work.</p>
            <p>Dr. Stanley Coulter, head of science was another of the grand men of the old faculty. He was a
                    character builder and an expert teacher. Students did not "cut" his classes. His
                    periods in the weekly class schedules of students were times of relaxation and absorbtion of
                    knowledge. There were no disciplinary problems. Each student, even one who was a rowdy at other
                    points on the campus, became a gentleman when he came into the presence of Stanley Coulter. Every
                    student who knew him remembers him as a personal friend.</p>
            <p>There were 149 graduates in my class in 1902; in June 1940 there were graduated 1072 students, not
                    counting 132 graduate students who received advanced degrees. When I visit the University now I feel
                    like a stranger on a strange campus. Old buildings are gone and most of the old professors are dead
                    and gone or have retired. The campus once faced south on State Street but now is so large that it
                    seems <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-036-3-047"/> to face in all directions. I feel that something has been
                    lost never to return. Many of the students and faculty are strangers to each other. Standardization
                    and system have become necessary. Everything is stream-lined and somewhat impersonal. The student
                    passes along on the "assembly line belt," while each professor tries to give him
                    something as he goes by. Everyone is in a hurry to go somewhere and to do something. I am now sixty
                    years of age. I have not retired, but I just want to slow down a little and enjoy things, so I have
                    built a home on a hill in a woods twelve miles from <placeName>

                    wild flowers and the birds. I drive in each day to my office in the city. As a farmer boy, I worked
                    to get into the city. After many years, I worked to get out of the City.</p>

            <p>For a brief span of years between 1807 and 1814, the most populous and the most important settlement
                    on the Buffalo Trace in Indiana Territory from Clarksville to Vincennes was White Oak Springs.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The White Oak Springs Fort stood within a large stockade on high ground

                    </placeName> County court-house at Petersburg, Indiana, and about one day's journey from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Because of its accessible location and its safe and commodious arrangements, it served
                    as a hostel for travellers to and from the territorial capital, and as an outpost and powder-base
                    for the territorial militia.</p>
            <p>The White Oaks Springs settlement had its beginnings between 1800 and 1807, when a little group of
                    immigrant families clustered themselves about the Fort on adjacent quarter sections of land on both
                    sides of the Trace, and it has had continuous existence from their day to this, as White Oak Springs

            <p>Hosea Smith was an earnest believer in divine guidance, and his arrival at White Oak Springs must
                    have confirmed his faith in the wisdom of the Almighty. He felt an affinity for the place from the
                    moment he laid eyes on it. It evoked his pride and devotion as if endowed with personality. He
                    reached his destination on June 5, 1810, and on June 14 he wrote to his brother John: "I
                    can inform the [thee] now that I have got home… . I have purchased Land at this place
                    caled [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] the White Oak Springs … . I like the Land the best I ever

            <p>The uneasy anticipation of Indian hostilities which was being felt by settlers on all the Indiana
                    frontiers was shared by those at White Oak Springs, and it is doubtful if any of the company of
                    Hosea Smith took immediate steps toward independent settlement. There were cabins enough for a dozen
                    families within the protection of the stockade. Joab Chappell shared the cultivation and the profits
                    of the growing crops, and in October Moses Harrell opened a school. Hosea Smith urged his friends

            <p>The abundance of people who moved into White Oak Springs in the fall of 1810 was followed by others
                    in each succeeding year. Exact dates and details of their coming have not been preserved, however,
                    as were those of Hosea Smith's, and it may be learned who they were only from a search of
                    public and private records, and by inquiry into the various family traditions current among their
                    descendants. From such sources a list has been compiled. In Township 1 North, Range 8 West, which
                    was the White Oak Springs congressional township, <placeName>

                    </placeName> County area outside White Oak Springs. Mention must be made, however, before going

                    all, were so held, all except three lying in the valley of Conger's Creek and its forks
                    within the area of the present <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>

                    </placeName> County (Township 1 North, Range 9 West). In 1806 and 1807 the validity of these grants

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> upon recommendation of the land commissioners of Indiana Territory and their owners
                    given legal title to their lands. The number of owners (25), plus the contiguous situations of their
                    lands, combine to suggest the existence of a community contemporary with and comparable in size to
                    that at White Oak Springs. Exhaustive inquiry <pb n="238" id="VAA4025-036-3-056"/> has not been made
                    into the history of the occupation of these tracts, but cursory investigation reveals that more than
                    half of them were held by lifelong residents of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> County. Families of the names of Pea, Glass, Frederick, and Catt, which are undoubtedly
                    descended from the holders of the ancient grants, have occupied the Conger's Creek vicinity
                    for generations; but, except in the case of Jacob Pea and possibly the Fredericks, no evidence has
                    been found that the original owners were occupying their grants in the period covered by this paper.
                    it seems fair to conclude therefore that probably fewer than a dozen holders of ancient grants in
                    the <placeName>

                    heads are named. Moreover, there are surely unavoidable omissions of unrecorded transients and of

            <p>At this point it must be admitted that only about half the boys from White Oak Springs and
                    thereabouts lasted the campaign through to share the Governor's praise for the fine showing
                    of Captain Wilson's Company. The rolls reveal that Robert Brenton, Thomas Milbourn, Jacob
                    Harbison, John Risley, and Jonathan Walker deserted on October 24, and that Peter and William
                    Brenton were permitted to return home on account of illness on October 27. However, failure of these
                    men to take part in the major engagement of the campaign seems to have done them no irreparable
                    discredit. All the deserters were back in the militia service in 1812, except Thomas Milbourn, who
                    returned in 1813.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> In March, 1815, Peter Brenton was appointed Ensign in the
                    First Battalion, Third Regiment, and Robert Brenton was commissioned Lieutenant of the Second
                    Battalion, First Regiment. Evidence of the esteem in which Peter Brenton was held among his superior
                    officers would be forthcoming in connection with an important later event. The only member of the
                    White Oak Springs contingent in the Governor's army to receive any distinguishing mark was
                    Wolsey Pride. He was credited with the assignment of "extra duty caring for the
                    sick," which reveals the woodsman and bear hunter in a humane role not customarily accorded
                    him.</p>

            <p>With the return of the Indian fighters, things around White Oak Springs began to pick up and hum. A
                    new year was upon them. The Indians were subdued, they thought, and optimism was in the air. Wolsey
                    Pride retired to the enjoyment of the elbow room on his choice quarter section near Highbanks and
                    Hosea Smith completed the business of acquiring legal title to White Oak Springs, "my
                    plantation," as he now called it. Jacob Chappell and his wife returned to their cabin up
                    the Trace with their little daughter and a young son, Stephen, born at the Fort while his father was
                    with General Harrison at the battle of <placeName>

                    new claim. Peter Brenton acquired the Silas Risley place, a quarter section which included what was
                    probably the handsomest site in the White Oak Springs vicinity, and which he was to donate later for

                    cultural backgrounds, and religious and political beliefs.</p>
            <p>If there was any unanimity of opinion among "new" and "old"

                    birth, and they, with their children, and other children and grandchildren of veterans made up a
                    consider-able part of the population. Events of 1811 to 1813 were, moreover, such as to refresh and
                    stimulate patriotic solicitude.</p>
            <p>There may also have been considerable, though perhaps not unanimous, subscription among these natives
                    of slavowning states to anti-slavery sentiment. The Quakers were committed to it, and we infer that
                    others were also, from the, fact that they chose to come into a territory expected to be a free
                    state, and that they brought no slaves with them.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>Territorial affairs were a close second in interest to national and affected life at White Oak
                    Springs, even more intimately. Indian policies, compulsory militia service, county and township
                    boundary changes, political parties and party politics, and changes in methods and personnel of
                    territorial government, were vital issues. Upon these there were undoubtedly differences of opinion.</p>
            <p>There is notable evidence that not all such differences, whether upon public or personal matters,

            <p>Hosea Smith's pious hope went unfulfilled and no meeting was ever organized at White Oak
                    Springs. It is not for us to raise the whys and wherefores of the will of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> in this matter, but from a strictly human point of view there were obvious obstacles to
                    the observance of the Friends' discipline. Joab Chappell violated it immediately upon his
                    arrival and Moses Harrell later by their engagements in militia service. Marriage within the society
                    was foreclosed to them, as members of their own group were already closely related, and they were
                    isolated from other groups. The plain language of Friends was ill-adapted to frontier situations
                    which required rough dealing, and the stricture of plain dress lost pertinence in an economy which
                    prescribed linsey-woolsey and leather. The difficulties of first-comers to a wilderness were hardly
                    met by arbitrary rules of meticulous conduct.</p>
            <p>Religious observance at White Oaks Springs was not, however, to depend wholly upon any one group of
                    its settlers. Contemporary with the coming of the natives of the Albemarle from the ancient
                    tide-water stronghold of American civilization, there was an assemblage of seasoned pioneers from
                    the wide-spread outposts of its latest frontiers. Many were straight from the camps of the Great
                    Revival which had rocked the South,<hi rend="sup">52</hi> and from the headquarters of the
                    Cumberland revolt against Calvinism.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Among them were evangels of the old and
                    the new doctrines which had lately undergone the fire of volcanic phenomena and emerged in variety
                    and temper suited to frontier needs. Certain of these doctrines gripped the people of White Oak
                    Springs, including the Quakers, and shook them into action for the salvation of their souls. Only
                    brief scenes of this drama have been preserved for us. From them and from its final outcome we may
                    conceive something of its intensity and its importance to those taking part.</p>

                    then or later, Cumberland Presbyterians, but tradition, doubtless for good and sufficient reason,
                    singles out the young wife and mother (she was twentyone and had a one year old son, James) for the

            <p>Many of the newcomers were men of gifts and skills and all joined in the common objective of creating

            <p>Hosea Smith was a surveyor, and the services of no profession were more acutely needed. Government
                    surveys completed in 1805 were marked by mile posts and blazed bearing and line trees, into sections
                    and quarter sections, but into no smaller tracts. Moreover, "county towns" were to
                    be laid out in the near future, of which Hosea Smith was to lay out at least
                    three—Portersville, Petersburg, and <placeName>

                    is no exception. Mrs. Zachariah Selby (Mary Ann Wease) whose husband and two brothers had moved from <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1807 to a location "about six miles west of White Oak Springs"
                    told her granddaughters, Mrs. Mary Ann Selby Colvin and Mrs. America Selby Pomernecke, that at the
                    time she had her first baby the Indians "lived in the same yard" with them. When
                    her husband went to mill at Wheeling (<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> County) or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he feared to leave her alone among them and so she and her baby would ride behind him
                    and the grain sacks as far as the White Oak Springs Fort, where she would wait the two or three days
                    until his return. Later, when the Indians had proved themselves friendly, she remained at home. Just
                    when Moses Harrell's <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-036-3-072"/> mill went into operation we do
                    not know, but let us hope it was promptly.</p>
            <p>As a tribute to sentiment, attention is called to the fact that upon the same day that Moses Harrell
                    got the writ issued for his mill site (March 12, 1816), he also acquired a license to marry Miss
                    Mary Miley, and that Justice Hosea Smith subsequently made them man and wife.</p>

                    enlistment was larger. Moreover, the militia law remained as strict as in 1812. The few who were

                    Pride ensign. There were also other short single periods of service; but the frontier was
                    practically clear of Indians, the worst of their threat to the pioneer existence was ended and the

                            information and heard no tradition that could be construed to mean that White Oak Springs
                            ever suffered from any hostile Indian attack. This was a great disillusionment for one of
                            the authors of this article, who spent many exciting childhood hours re-enacting the bloody
                            defense of the Fort from behind the portholes of the two story log house which remained of
                            the buildings that had stood within the stockade. This has now been razed, and there is no
                            reminder of White Oak Springs to appeal to the historic sense or the imagination of the

            <p>Inasmuch as frontier justice is commonly the laughing stock of sophisticated generations, it seems
                    that an instance which commands respect today is worthy of report. In the case cited above Paul
                    Tislow vs. James Brenton, the judge handed down an opinion which for sound reasoning, clear-cut
                    language, and adherence to the point might well serve as a model for present day judges. The
                    conclusions, moreover, are a statement of law which would stand in the higher courts of the state of

            <p>In this cause the court delivered the following opinion: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>This writ of certiorari has been brought by Paul Tislow to reverse a judgment obtained
                            against him on James Brenton in a court for the trial of small causes before Justice Smith.
                            It appears from the record that the deft. appeared and attended to the trial.</p>
                        <p>The reasons assigned in the reversal of the judgment are 1st, that the warrant is defective,
                            2nd., that the Justice refused to permit the deft. upon his own request to swear to the
                            truth of his account.</p>
                        <p>As to the 1st. ground:—In the assignment it was suggested by this court and
                            admitted by Tislow's council that the appearance of a defdt. and preceeding to
                            trial cured any defect in the process. But it was contended that this doctrine does not
                            apply in Justices' Courts because as was said they are not courts of record. They
                            have authority to fine and imprison: besides, they are directed and obligated by express
                            words in the statute to keep a docket in which must be entered all the proceedings in the
                            cause—R. C. 220—and further the statute of 1811 authorizes the courts
                            of common pleas to issue writs of certiorari and makes it the duty of the Justice to whom a
                            certiorari is directed to send up a fair transcript of his record, which requisition of the
                            law would be absurd if there were no records belonging to the court. As therefore it is
                            admitted that appearances and proceeding to trial cures defect in process in court of record
                            the same circumstances cure defects of process in Justices' Courts, which are to
                            all intents and purposes, <list type="footnotes">

                            urged for reversal has been argued that the Justice committed error in refusing to permit
                            the defdt. at his own request, to swear to the truth of his account, the Justice giving as
                            reason for such refusal that he was appraised it could be proved that defts. account had
                            been paid.</p>
                        <p>This court consider it totally immaterial whether the reasons given by the Justice for the
                            refusal are sound or not; the only question is—did he commit an error in not
                            complying with defts. request? We are of the opinion he did not; the defdt. had no right nor
                            had the Justice any Authority to permit him, to swear to the truth of his account, unless
                            particularly requested so to do by the adverse party—Acts of 1813, page
                            115—but it does not appear from the record that any such request was made.</p>

            <p>An event occurred in 1813 (May 1) which was even more distressing than the change of a county seat.
                    This was the removal of the territorial capital from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Corydon by order of the territorial legislature. Whatever character and importance
                    White Oak Springs had, or might have, it owed to its propinquity to the territorial capital and its
                    situation on the main traveled road thereto. The effect of this act of the legislature was to reduce
                    it to a condition of provincial isolation, and to remove from its reach the world of affairs. Hosea
                    Smith could no longer write the news of public men and events in Indiana territory to the folks back
                    in Carolina with the authoritative and familiar preface "I heard the Governor
                    say… . " Corydon was almost as in-accessible as a foreign capital, and the trip
                    there was too difficult and too expensive to make for any except necessary and urgent business.
                    George Chambers made it in 1824 to settle the estate of his father, John Chambers, and among his
                    expense items filed, "two trips to Cordden—$18."</p>
            <p>In 1814, the post road was rerouted and White Oak Springs left off, the new route passing to the

            <p>"Hosea Smith's" was of course the Fort, still, as ever since its founding,
                    the center of community affairs. Theophila Smith Alexander often told her granddaughter, Mrs. Anna
                    Alexander Brenton, of the visits of Indians to the Fort. She said they would crouch in a ring around
                    the walls of her mother's kitchen, each with his dog at his side. When her mother passed
                    refreshments, all shared with their pets, while not one, to her amazement and indignation, ever
                    asked for food to take to his wife and children, or carried away any of his portion for them.</p>
            <p>The only available first-hand accounts of life at White Oak Springs are the brief comments of Hosea
                    Smith in his letters. It was not the time nor the place for any effort approaching the literary. In
                    fact, there was a high percentage of illiteracy, as may be noted from the many signatures on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> County records followed by "his (x) mark." There were numerous and
                    notable exceptions, however. John Coonrod signed his name in beautiful German script,
                    "Johannes Coonrod," and the Miley family owned, and surely some could read, a
                    small library of German books. James <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-036-3-080"/> Brenton acted as secretary
                    for public meetings and was the author of petitions and resolutions. Hosea Smith kept accounts of
                    his personal and official business, his big walnut desk being stuffed, as his grandchildren
                    remembered, with correspondence and legal papers. Paul Tislow made scrupulous reports to the Court
                    of an estate which he admistered. David Miley gave expert clerical service to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> County for many years in every county office. Thomas J. Withers and Henry Brenton
                    served as associate judges, their office elective and presupposing superior wisdom and common sense
                    rather than knowledge of law. David Kinman was the only poet among them, as well as can be learned.
                    Unfortunately in the one example of his work preserved, his "Journey Song," he did
                    not describe life at White Oak Springs. He did, however, describe experiences and give utterance to
                    emotions shared by all who joined him there, for which he may properly be called The Poet of White
                    Oak Springs. All had suffered the same sadness and anxiety of leave-taking of which he wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Farewell my old neighbors, I bid you adieu I am going to travel the wilderness through I am
                            going to travel the desert all through So farewell my old relation, I bid you adieu.</p>
                    </quote>Almost all had travelled the same westward road and felt the rebirth of hope and the new
                    vision which Cumberland, of which he wrote, symbolized: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Life was undoubtedly very real and very earnest at White Oak Springs, but it had its lighter moments
                    and days. According to the stories prefaced by "my grandmother used to tell," or
                    "my grandfather told us," phrases which may be quoted from interviews with a
                    number of grandchildren of White Oak Springs, camp meetings and muster days were the most memorable
                    occasions. Play-parties must have been a form of amusement for the young, as Skip-to-my-Lou and
                    Weevily Wheat were still being played at parties in Petersburg in the first decade of the twentieth
                    century. Infares also survived to the near-present, and prove that weddings were occasions <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-036-3-081"/> for celebration. Opportunities were not lacking as the number
                    of marriages which Justice Hosea Smith performed during his tenure of office show a far departure
                    from the little series of Arnold to Coonrod, Coonrod to Miley, Miley to Pride, Pride to Brenton
                    marriages which Squire Henry Brenton performed in the cozy old days of 1809. The new justice
                    performed marriage ties for the following:<hi rend="sup">72</hi>

                        <p>One reed came into my hands as the property of William Brenton sometime in the summer of 1817
                            not accounted for in the appraisement of said Brenton's property. The reed is now

            <p>Willie Brenton was, we should say, fairly well stocked with this world's goods, as measured
                    by the standard of his time and place. He had the first two of what his contemporary, Daniel <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>, called the three necessities of a man's existence—a good
                    rifle-gun, a good horse, and a good woman. Brenton's possession of a loom, a reed and an
                    "improvement," suggests moreover, that his menage may have been at one time graced
                    by the presence of the third of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>'s necessities.</p>
            <p>There are a number of household inventories of the period on record, all of which emphasize the
                    scarcity and high intrinsic value of personal property. Counterpanes and camphor bottles, chopping
                    axes and razor cases were traded, mortgaged and disposed of by will as carefully as rifle-guns,
                    horses, and quarter sections. By far the most pretentious of these inventories is that of Hosea
                    Smith's chattels recorded in connection with a mortgage. In contrast to the one-man outfit
                    of the "Lone Ranger," Willie Brenton, and to the property described in most such
                    recorded lists, Smith's array of wealth seems grand indeed: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The foregoing picture of people and events in and about White Oak Springs has been drawn from every
                    source known and available to the authors. Even so, it is indistinct and uncertain. One feature is
                    clear, however, and that is the resemblance of the early community to that of today. No student of
                    the community's past who is also an observer of <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-036-3-084"/> its
                    present could escape the conclusion that Petersburg is the heir of the flesh and spirit of White Oak
                    Springs.</p>
            <p>More than thirty of the family names of White Oak Springs (about 50 in all) survive in Petersburg
                    today, as does the blood of some families whose names have disappeared. The authors, being neither
                    native nor kin to natives, had no especially favorable opportunity to observe this phenomenon. Yet
                    during the fraction of the author's lifetimes spent there, they knew personally the
                    descendants of at least thirty of the original immigrants; and, as was learned while making this
                    study, as many as thirty descend-ants of one immigrant. It is a statistical project to compute the
                    descendants of ancestors such as Stanton Lamb, one of whose children is reported to have complained
                    that "not one of my father's children ever got acquainted with all the
                    others"; or such as the Kinman brothers, David, James, Levi, and Jeremiah, to members of
                    whose families forty-nine marriage licenses were issued by the clerks of the <placeName>

                    news. They are the "substantial citizens" of the town and surrounding farms. They
                    practice law, carry the mails, teach in the city and country schools, keep store, hold county and
                    state offices, and engage in banking, farming and business. They send their sons and daugters to

                    play bridge for amusement, and belong to Kiwanis and D.A.R. Yes, and if the whole truth be required,
                    there are those who loaf upon the street corners, disagree with one another as did their forefathers
                    of old, get themselves locked in the county jail, and help to fill the docket of the Circuit Court
                    of <placeName>

            <p>Petersburg has, of course, had other accreditions of population. The immigration that first populated
                    White Oak Springs continued for another decade. The arrival from eastern states in the
                    eighteen-forties of other pre-Revolutionary American families resulted in the founding of the
                    Presbyterian <list type="footnotes">

                    other Catholics to form a congregation, though not enough to the present date to support a resident
                    priest. In late years, the accents of a few French and Italian newcomers fall strangely on ears so
                    long accustomed only to English.</p>
            <p>The town has had other extraneous influences also which should not be overlooked. Many of its
                    educators, preachers, newspaper editors, and other cultural leaders have been outsiders. Development
                    of natural resources and public improvements have depended largely upon imported capital and labor.

                    labors for a while and departing. The comparative few who have remained were chiefly those who fused
                    their lives and fortunes with the never-failing main source of population that had its roots at
                    White Oak Springs.</p>
            <p>All things considered, it seems proper to state that Petersburg is the issue of White Oak Springs,
                    and that its civic morals, culture levels and social standards are the accumulation of currents of
                    thought and action which were set flowing between 1800 and 1817, and still flow in
                    1940—broadened some, but with little change in course and with few ripples and eddies to
                    mark tributary influences.</p>
            <p>This account may fittingly close with an account of the tragio-comic proceedings which wrought the
                    change of the community's center and name from White Oak Springs to Petersburg. Hosea Smith
                    had a prominent part in it, of course, although the outcome was exactly contrary to his
                    calculations. Foreseeing the imminent formation of a new county, he prepared to meet the ensuing
                    demand for a suitable county seat. On the White Oak Springs quarter section he laid out a town,
                    named it <placeName>

                    only person with the conviction that his site was the ideal choice for the commissioners. Peter
                    Brenton was possessed with the selfsame notion in regard to the quarter section he had acquired from
                    Silas Risley in 1812. Moreover, he was willing to donate it. All that motivated Peter Brenton to
                    this burst of generosity may never be known. It may have been solely public spirit, but a guess may
                    be ventured that, unless <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-036-3-087"/> he was more saintly than human,
                    incentive must have been added to his original motive by the thought of beating Hosea Smith at his
                    own game.</p>
            <p>There were present in the situation all the components of a first rate factional line up and
                    squabble, with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName> lot purchasers on the side of Hosea Smith and the unbiased friends of public economy
                    and personal supporters of Peter Brenton opposing. No inkling of such survives, however, and only
                    the bare factual conclusions of the conflict are known.</p>

                    eligible and beautiful situation," "its natural advantages," and
                    "with due regard to its present and future population," the commissioners favored
                    Peter Brenton's site.</p>
            <p>At that moment, white Oak Springs received its commitment to obscurity, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>

                    plan and survey the new town to be named "Petersburgh" (modern spellers drop the
                        <hi rend="i">h</hi>) for Peter Brenton. Though it may have been a heavy task, he did it
                    handsomely, with Main Street a hundred feet wide running the picturesque ridge course of the Buffalo
                    Trace northeast by southwest for a third of a mile, "from Henry Miley's ash tree
                    to Peter Brenton's new. building." In order to give the town this beautiful
                    setting and at the same time plat it in symmetrical form, additional acres to those offered by Peter
                    Brenton were required. Henry Miley responded to the public need with a grant of twenty-six acres and
                    John Coonrod with two and a half acres, neither it appears asking recompense or recogless <list type="footnotes">

                    hundred twelve acres, went all the distinction.</p>
            <p>The first meetings of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> County commissioners were held in February and March, 1817, and the first terms of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> County Court in April and July, "at Hosea Smiths." By November,
                    however, the new courthouse was completed, according, as we hope, to the specifications,
                    "24x 32, 2 stories high, of well hewn logs with a good joint shingle roof, well chinked and
                    daubed, with good floors tongued and grooved.</p>
            <p>… " Court convened therein, and Peter Brenton's town entered upon the
                    full enjoyment of its rights, powers and privileges as the seat of justice of the new county of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName>, of the state of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Thus was defeated the ambition of Hosea Smith to found a new <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the valley of <geogName>White River</geogName>. But there remained to him other of
                    the "consolateing blessings of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>," to use his own phrase. There was for instance the postoffice, which he held
                    at White Oak Springs until it was discontinued in 1823, and a new one established at Peters- burg
                    with Moses Harrell as postma~ter.~~There was also the opportunity re-opened to him to expand White
                    Oak Springs into a large and beautiful estate such as he had known well in the south; such perhaps,
                    as the manor plantation of his grandfather, Abraham Hosea, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pasquotank</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. This he proceeded to do, entering upon a series of transactions that involved a
                    thousand acres of land and which spread the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> County records with his name and the names of his holdings. In addition to the White
                    Oak Springs estate, there were the peach plantation, the walnut grove, the sugar camp quarter, the
                    forge, the horse-mill tract, and others.</p>
            <p>On the twenty-second of June, 1845, Hosea Smith re- corded the departure from this life of his wiPe,
                    Huldah, and noted that, "She lived at the White Oak Springs 35 yr. 17 days." On
                    November 1, 1846, Hosea himself departed this life, and it should be noted, as he would have it, no
                    doubt: "He lived at the White Oak Springs 36 yr. 4 mo. 22 days." It would seem
                    that these events of the years 1845 and 1846, rather than those of 1817, mark the final passing of
                    the breath and spirit of White Oak Springs.</p>

                    </placeName>. In the absence of Mr. Yule from the state, Mr. Smith is acting-chairman. His office is
                    in the Indiana Historical Society Library (William Henry Smith Memorial) in the State Library and
                    Historical Building. This committee has been working since 1931, and its chairman, formerly engineer
                    in the State Highway Department, began his study of these bridges in Indiana earlier than that.</p>
            <p>Indiana was one of the foremost of the states, if not the foremost, in surmounting the difficulties,
                    delays, and expense of fords and ferrys by the building of covered bridges. This was principally in
                    the second and last thirds of the nineteenth century. Some of the best and some of the longest
                    bridges in the country were erected in this state. From time to time reports of the committee and
                    lists of bridges have been published in the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi>. An account
                    of the famous <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> River drawbridge (originally a covered timber bridge) at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, replaced about ten years ago by the concrete bridge which is one of the finest parts
                    of the George Rogers Clark Memorial setting, was published in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi>, June, 1935, under the title "The <placeName>

                    </placeName> River."</p>
            <p>These bridges have been, and are being replaced rapidly by modern concrete and steel bridges owing to
                    the heavier dmands of present-day traffic and to the increased cost of lumber. One of the early
                    covered timber bridges was removed and fortunately rebuilt in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> County State Park. Several others have been saved by relocation of roads and by the
                    interest which has been aroused in these structures. A great many are still deing duty and testify
                    to the sturdiness of this type of bridge. There are several counties, however, in which there are no
                    covered bridges standing.</p>
            <p>The Committee and the Society hope that some time an illustrated book can be compiled and published
                    by the Society which will preserve knowledge of these memorials and give readers some of the flavor
                    of the old horse and buggy days.</p>

            <p>The Committee on Early Water-Power Mills has been doing a similar work with early mills. It consists

                    Indianaolis, chairman, Richard C. Smith, Frederick Polley, Edgar H. Evans of <placeName>

                    reports to Indiana History Conferences published in the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi>
                    beginning in the years 1935-36, an article in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>,
                    December, 1936, by Denzil Doggett on "Water-Power Mills on Flat Rock River," and
                    the very imposing collection of accounts and pictures of early water-power mills in every county in
                    the state now on file in the Society Library. A well-nigh complete account of the mills of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> County, illustrated with photographs, by Dr. William M. Reser of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, is as yet unpublished.</p>
            <p>One can scarcely over-estimate the part which waterpower mills played in the settlement and
                    development of Indiana. They were a necessity in every poineer commuity, frequently the center of
                    settlement; without them it is difficult to say whether civilized life could have been maintained in
                    poineer days. Nearly a thousand sites have been been identified in the state and a few of the very
                    early mills are still standing; they are among the most picturesque buildings that one can visit.
                    The rebuilt mill in Spring Mill Park testifies to the interest of the public</p>
            <p>There are enough pictures and authentic accounts of mills in the Society Library to make a handsome
                    volume on pioneer mills. Additional information is coming in and before long the Society ought to
                    undertake the publication of such a volume. It would be one of the most interesting of all its
                    publications, and not the least valuable.</p>
            <p>The Committee on Historical Buildings, Sites and Markers is chiefly active in gathering information
                    and in promoting organization of movements in the interest of preserving historic buildings and

                    with the Library of Congress and the American Institute of Architects, was headed in Indiana by the
                    chairman of this committee. Its reports contain detailed drawings and photographs and historical
                    accounts of twenty-eight buildings in Indiana of historical and architectural value. The complete

            <p>"The State University has … both a peculiar power in the directness of its
                    influence upon the whole people and a peculiar limitation in its dependence upon the people. The
                    ideals of the people constitute the atmosphere in which it moves, though it can itself affect this
                    atmosphere. Herein is the source of its strength and the direction of its difficulties. For to
                    fulfill its mission of uplifting the state to continuously higher levels the University must, in the
                    words of Mr. Bryce "serve without yielding to it;" it must recognize new needs
                    without becoming subordinate to the immediately practical, to the shortsightedly expedient. It mush
                    not sacrifice the higher efficiency for the more obvious but lower efficiency. It must have the
                    wisdom to make expenditures for results which pay manifold in the enrichment of civilization, but
                    which are not immediate and palpable."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> —Frederick Jackson

            <p>The manuscript copies of the letters printed below, except the one written in 1848, were obtained
                    from Mrs. Wilson Short of Worthington, Indiana, through the good offices of Miss Lorena Cullison.
                    The Civil War letters were accidently discovered in an attic by Bobby ("Bob") <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Short and Jack Austin Short, two school boys, and brought to the attention of Miss
                    Cullison, who is a teacher in the Worthington Public Schools. The old Hollis home in Worthington was
                    purchased by the Short family in recent years. It was while the house was being remodeled
                    preparatory to occupancy by the Short family that the two boys Bob and Jack Short found the letters.
                    Bert Hollis, a son of the Thomas ("Tom") Hollis, to whom the letters of 1862-1866
                    were written, now lives in Worthington. Thomas Hollis was a younger brother of Joseph H. Hollis,
                    Heber Hollis and Charles Hollis. Emma Hollis, a sister mentioned in several letters, was younger
                    than the four brothers. She was a student at Indiana University at the time of the Civil War. No
                    information relative to Frank W. Knowles, writer of several of the letters, save that contained in
                    the correspondence has been found. His own statements indicate that he was from the vicinity of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, and that he was stationed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for three months in the summer of 1863. There, he became acquainted with Thomas Hollis.
                    While in Indiana, Knowles must have visited in the Hollis home at Worthington, as it is clear from
                    his letters that he knew Tom's sister Emma. Knowles and Tom Hollis saw service together at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>, after their regiment was ordered South. Their later
                    correspondence seems to have been simply an outcome of the friendship that grew up between the two
                    men in 1863 while in East <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The father of Emma Hollis and her brothers was the Rev. Humphrey Hollis, an Episcopalian minister. He
                    and his wife were living at Worthington in the Civil War period. In his letter of December 7, 1862,
                    from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> front to Tom, Joe speaks of the father and mother as "getting old."</p>
            <p>The last letter here published, written by Harrison N. Throop in 1848, has no connection with those
                    that precede it in the series. The writer of this early letter was a preacher, <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-036-3-094"/> who was temporarily keeping the Junction House, a tavern, at Point
                    Commerce, Indiana. Rev. Throop was the father of Julia Throop who became the wife of Thomas Hollis,
                    the recipient of the letters of the Civil War period. The Throop letter of 1848 is a treasured
                    possession of Bert Hollis of Worthington. Being a son of Thomas and Julia Throop Hollis, the present
                    Mr. Hollis is a grandson of the Rev. Humphrey Hollis and also of the Rev. Harrison N. Throop.</p>

                        <p>I take a few spare moments to write you a few lines. I would have written sooner only
                                    that we have had no mail for over a week and I do not know as you will get this for
                                    I hear that all of our mail is stopped at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> but I will try and send you this short note hit or miss. We have not
                                    made any move here yet and how soon we will is a question. Our Cavlery have been
                                    doing some good work over on the Rail Road I suppose you have seen an account of it.
                                    The late order of Gen. Pope is causing the "Stay at Home Rebils"
                                    to feel very bad. It is a good thing and will go farther tword putting down the
                                    Rebellion than anything done for some time. I think that things are beginning to
                                    wind up, and, if I am not much mistaken, the War will end right here in Va. But
                                    there is much blood to be spilt yet before it closes. How is recruiting going on in
                                    your state? I hear that III. has her quota full. I hope the boys will turn out to
                                    put down the Rebellion if we get our 300,000 men out we certainly will win the day.
                                    I fear that the war has been kept up longer than necessary, but I think the day is
                                    now passed and the Rebils will be dealt with the same as if they were a Foreign
                                    nation. I hope that it will soon close for if I am ever to get home it may be this
                                    fall, I have not been very well of late and when I am not well I do not like
                                    soldiering so well. You will have to excuse short-cut for I have to go.</p>

                                    quiet to-day. Last night was the coldest we have had it was a beautiful night the
                                    moon shone bright as day and the Stars looked as if they would burst from their

                                    </placeName>. I hope it will be only upon our own terms. We have fought them so long
                                    let us see it out. one side or the other will claim the victory and if it is a
                                    Compromise the South will always be puting upon the North untill it will be war
                                    again. I never want to see an-other war of this kind. Tell Mother that I enquired
                                    for her friend Mrs. Baker of a young Lady that has lived here for years and knew
                                    her. She says that she Mrs. Baker went to the South shortly after the war broke out
                                    She was Sesesh. tell her I did not know before that she had any Seseh friends but so
                                    it is with Civil War Brother against Brother and Father against Son and Son against
                                    Son. I hope that our Southern friends will try and lay down their arms and come back
                                    into the good old Union and I will inshure her to never sink. and I know that Uncle
                                    Sam will do as much for them and more than any one else. This has been a sad war.
                                    Not one half of it is yet told. <placeName>

                                    wrote to Father on the 6th. I hope he gets my letters all. You must write when you

                                    account of it in the papers but it is beyond discription the roar of artillery and
                                    musketry is [was] beyond anything you can imagine. How little people at Home know
                                    about war. Our camp is more gloomy than it ever yet was known to be. Our Col was
                                    wounded in the brest and passing into his arm. We will lose him. our Lt.-Col. was
                                    wounded at Cross Keys and is not able to keep the field. He has resigned and our
                                    Capt has been appointed Provost Marshal, 17<hi rend="i">th</hi> District of <placeName>

                                    many a man left killed or wounded upon the battle field our ranks are thined by this
                                    wicked Rebellion, everything looks so very dull. we had Corps drill yesterday and
                                    our Regt. turned out about what we had in one company when we left Camp Chase. One
                                    more fight and we are all gone. No more of the 25<hi rend="i">th</hi> will be left.
                                    but we all wish to see the Rebellion finished. The Rebils all had their canteens
                                    full of whiskey and Gun powder and they fought walking up to the very cannon mouth.
                                    but what a sin it is to put men into battle in that way where they are like demons.
                                    I pray God may turn their hearts and that they may see the folly of their ways. We
                                    are having fine weather now but when across the River [Rappahannock] we had a good
                                    share of rain. I wish I could get to come and see you but it is impossable I have
                                    been trying to get leave to go to <placeName>

                                    </placeName> for a few days, but it is not in the Books. I suppose we will soon move
                                    again and it is reported that General Hooker has again crossed the River. I think
                                    not, for a great many Regiments have left for home, their time haveing expired and I
                                    do not see why we should move before we get men to fill up the Regiments. I suppose
                                    you have seen a account of Gen Milroys Sword given by our Regiment. I have no news
                                    to tell you only that all again is quiet. Write soon and all of the news.</p>

                                    Mother. Yours the 24<hi rend="i">th</hi> of June, Father's the 25<hi rend="i">th</hi>, Mother's July 6<hi rend="i">th</hi>. they all found
                                    me well I have been with the Baggage train since on the march. I had no place
                                    assigned to me so I took up with the opportunity to ride here, or I would have to go
                                    afoot as they have taken my horse. I have done nothing since this Batry was in the
                                    Battle of Gettysburgh.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> We had eight wounded, all from the old
                                    11th but one they were all slight wounded but one he was shot through the abdomen.
                                    The Batry is now at South M[o]untain where I suppose there will soon be a Bloody
                                    Battle. Six hundred prisoners came in yesterday. They are getting badly whipped. Dix

                                    Her side she thought was getting worse. I advised her to go to — <hi rend="sup">15</hi> again &amp; let Dr. Hubbard cure her. I told her she
                                    might have money if she needed it, but she thinks she ought not to take it. I laugh
                                    at her. She says I will need it when the war is over, but as long as I can spare her
                                    pain &amp; make her comfortable I don't care if it takes all I can
                                    earn. She is welcome to it. She has earned it taking care of me in my younger days,

                                    prepared to meet in the next world where there is no war. Live near to God, Dear
                                    Brother, &amp; trust in Him. He will hear your prayers. You are now in the way
                                    of temptation. be careful, watch, and pray lest you enter the paths of wickedness.

                        <p>As it has been some time since I have heard from you and just receiving a letter from
                                    Father giving me your address, I will drop you a line and let you know I am yet in

                                    I think of haveing the extreme pleasure of helping takeing the City of <placeName>

                                    </placeName> but so it is to be. We arrived here upon the 13th of August and have
                                    had the pleasure of helping take the great Fort Wagoner. Morris Island is all ours
                                    now, with it Ft. Wagoner, Ft. Gregg and Sumter. it is knocked into a pile <hi rend="i">of rubish and brick</hi>, the Fort will be of no use to us, and there
                                    is many Forts yet to take before we get into the great City. they tell us that the
                                    people in there has no very kind feeling for the "Yanks", but we
                                    shall see before long. Gen. Gilmore never undertakes a thing without puting it
                                    through, and when he has taken one of the strongest Forts in the Country, what is

                        </salute>
                        <p>Your favor of June 21<hi rend="i">st</hi> came to hand yesterday finding me in good
                                    health but not the best of spirits, for we had just got the news of our Cavalry
                                    meeting with such poor success on their way back after having accomplished so great
                                    an object, but we must expect some reverses, but this is a sad one for we are not so
                                    well off for Horses as we might be.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing new from our front. We still continue to throw a few shell into
                                    Petersburg, but it don't appear to be accomplishing a great deal. We are
                                    getting pretty well rested, however, a thing which when we came here was very much
                                    needed. The water we get is rather poor being a white clayey color. The country here
                                    is quite level. Dust, there is no end to. We stand very much in need of Rain which I
                                    hope we will get soon.</p>
                        <p>You are correct in thinking this is the roughest Campaign since the War. the like has
                                    never been seen but we now are having a rest &amp; plenty to eat, so we have no
                                    cause for complaint. But the great Question is, how will it terminate. We have lost
                                    a great many men &amp; Lee appears to meet us wherever we go. They (the Johnies)
                                    have got splendid works &amp; positions, which we cannot deny. It may be we can
                                    so hem them in that they will be obliged to evacuate, but this will take a long time
                                    &amp; more men than we have at present.</p>
                        <p>If I were to have it my way, all the <hi rend="i">Arms</hi> that are now Idle should
                                    be manned. there is no use puttering any longer. if they want to put down the
                                    Rebellion let them call men enough at once &amp; crush it, not dally along with
                                    a few thousand at the time. There is where the trouble has always been. We never had
                                    men enough. if in the start if it had been six hundred thousand instead of
                                    seventy-five thousand, the War might of been Stopped at once, but they let them get

                                    Who knows but it may. I fear not, though, but let us pray for a Speedy peace to our

                        <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
                        <p>I have been looking for a long time for a letter from you but I guess you will not
                                    write untill I send you a few lines and to tell you the truth there is not much to
                                    write about. The expedition that left here has been heard from. They landed on James
                                        Island<hi rend="sup">25</hi> and have taken all but Fort Johnston<hi rend="sup">26</hi> on the Island. If they get that, Charles-ton will be one of the Citys
                                    that was. Our loss is reported to be very heavy but I hope it may prove less than
                                    report says. Our Reg't being on pickit duty we did not get to go, and it
                                    may all be for the best as the losses have been very great. In fact, our
                                    Reg't has been very lucky. Since its re-inlistment we came to this
                                    Department from <placeName>

                        <p>We are very pleasantly located but the weather is extreamly hot. I would much prefer
                                    being farther North but I will have to be satisfied to remain where Uncle Sam sens

                        <p>By this time you think that I have quite forgotten you, and I acknowledge that you
                                    have good cause for thinking so, and have often wished that it could be otherwise,
                                    but "business has to come before pleasure" now.</p>
                        <p>I have, since my last writing, received three letters from you with much pleasure,
                                    and will now do the best I can towards answering them and also let you know what I
                                    have been doing all this time.</p>
                        <p>The last time I wrote you (lay that blot to a dose of "Spiritus
                                    I'rumento" just taken) I was at Hd. <hi rend="i">Qrs</hi>. 2<hi rend="i">d</hi> Div. lying around at <placeName>

                                    </placeName> with nothing to do but play euchre from morning till night. We were
                                    kept in this way until the 20th of April, when the Corps was organized into four
                                    Divisions, and the 3<hi rend="i">d</hi> assigned to Gen. Wilcox. We were then
                                    ordered to prepare at once for the field and on April 23<hi rend="i">d</hi> left for <placeName>

                                    Blackburne's Ford, and Bristoe Station, arriving on the 29<hi rend="i">th</hi>. May 4<hi rend="i">th</hi> we left the Junotion [Warrenton] under orders to
                                    join the Army of the Potomac and marched across the Rappahanock and Rapidan to the

                                    Capt. Hutchins and Major Lyon of this staff wounded. May 7<hi rend="i">th</hi> we
                                    moved for Spottsylvania C. H. via Chancellorsville and on the 9<hi rend="i">th</hi>
                                    arrived at the Ny River, crossed and became engaged with the enemy. We were about
                                    Spottsylvania, all the time changing position and engaged more or less until May
                                        21<hi rend="i">st</hi> when we took up our line of march for the North Anna
                                    River, where we relieved a Div. of the 2<hi rend="i">d</hi> Corps at Ox Ford. There

                                    On June 1<hi rend="i">st</hi> the enemy attacked us, but they were repulsed. During
                                    that engage, Lt. Brackett was slightly wounded in the knee and the Genl. had a very
                                    narrow escape, as a ball went through his coat, vest, and both shirts without
                                    touching him. Next day (June 2<hi rend="i">d</hi>) we started for Cold Harbor, but
                                    did not succeed in getting half way as the Rebs attacked us near Bethsada Church,
                                    and got a good thrashing for their trouble. We fought on the 2<hi rend="i">d</hi>
                                    and 3<hi rend="i">d</hi> and then went on to Cold Harbor, as the Johnnies left
                                    before daylight on the 4<hi rend="i">th</hi>. We were at Cold Harbor from the 5<hi rend="i">th</hi> to the 12<hi rend="i">th</hi> of June, during which time we
                                    built a large Redoubt on our front, and did some damage to the enemy, but on the
                                    evening of the 12<hi rend="i">th</hi> we commenced our march to the James, crossed
                                    on the 15<hi rend="i">th</hi> at Windmill Point, and moved here to the support of
                                    the 18<hi rend="i">th</hi> Corps. On the 17<hi rend="i">th</hi> and 18<hi rend="i">th</hi> we fought the hardest battle of this campaign. The General was wounded
                                    on the 18<hi rend="i">th</hi> by a piece of shell, in the leg, but would not leave
                                    the field. Another of our Staff whom you do not know, was slightly injured on the
                                        17<hi rend="i">th</hi> and one of the orderlies killed. Our Act'g.
                                    Engineer Officer was killed at North Anna River, and the Capt. who took Maj.
                                    Lyon's place while he is on leave, was wounded on the 6<hi rend="i">th</hi>
                                    of this month.</p>
                        <p>What has been done here since the engagements of the 17<hi rend="i">th</hi> and 18<hi rend="i">th</hi> ult. is contraband news, but you will probably hear from us
                                    very soon, if I can be any judge of the "signs of the times."</p>
                        <p>I have been kept as busy as it was possible to be since we have been here in copying
                                    the records of the Division, which had to be kept on paper during the previous
                                    active part of the campaign, be-sides that I had the back Returns to make up and
                                    altogether they have given me no time to write private letters, hardly a chance to
                                    keep the folks at home posted. Yesterday I succeeded in getting a clerk to help me,
                                    and now hope to have a little more time to myself. My records are all written up
                                    except my "Letters Received" and in that I have only a half a
                                    month's work to copy.</p>
                        <p>I was very glad to hear of your good luck on your trip over the mountains and safe
                                    arrival home.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> We often wondered how "Tom was getting
                                    along" during your trip. Your letter of April 10<hi rend="i">th</hi> came
                                    along about a month after yours of April 21<hi rend="i">st</hi> and the last not a
                                    great while ago. I suppose that your sister thinks that I am never intending to
                                    answer her letter, but I shall, just as soon as I can get accounts straightened out

                                    letters about this time (midnight) and it is rather difficult to write a decent
                                    letter after being steadily at work all day (This one is sufficient proof of that).

                        <p>Yours of the 14th was received this morning and not knowing "what a day may
                                    bring forth" to prevent my writing, I think that I will answer it
                                    immediately.</p>
                        <p>Since my last, our quiet good times have been somewhat disturbed. The night I wrote
                                    you July 29<hi rend="i">th</hi> I was up until about 21/2 o'clock and then
                                    after a short nap got up at 4 A. M. on the 30<hi rend="i">th</hi> just as the
                                    General and staff rode off. At 20 minutes of 5 o'clk the mine under the
                                    rebel fort was exploded, which was a signal for the artillery to open, and such a
                                    roar as run along the line I never before heard. This, with the 1<hi rend="i">st</hi> and 2<hi rend="i">nd</hi> Div. charged on the breach caused by the
                                    explosion, and carried the line on each side of the fort for a short distance but
                                    after that, no advantage was gained. Our 4<hi rend="i">th</hi> Div. (Nigs) came up,
                                    and attempted a charge but rushed back in confusion, and at 3 P.M. we retired to our
                                    own line. During the engagement I was at an Earthwork about 800 yds. from tie point
                                    of assault and had a splendid view of the fight. I would like very much to have you

                                    written I had the misfortune to break the silver clasp on my teeth, and accordingly,
                                    have obtained a Surgeon's Certificate from Dr. O'Connell, I
                                    applied for and obtained a furlough of 30 days. I should have sent this before I
                                    went, but the fight with the 2nd Corps happened on Aug. 25th and our Div. had to
                                    pack up and go to their support, and not get the desk out again until about 15
                                    minutes before I started for City Point on the 26th of August. After spending three
                                    weeks very pleasantly at home I came back arriving at the Weldon R. R. on the 25th
                                    of September. In my absence the Divisions of this Corps have been changed making

                                    orders to be ready to move and on Sept. 30th we moved to this place, took two lines
                                    of works and established a line of our own. Yesterday the whole Corps went out about
                                    two miles on a recconnoisance in force, to feel of the enemy and met with but little

                        <p>While at home I had a chance to see some few young ladies, but from some cause, I do
                                    not feel so much interest in the sex—except in some cases—as I
                                    did before I left home. Perhaps that is on account of being for so long a time
                                    deprived entirely of their society. The Dr. Richards (Now Capt. Richards) and

                                    her for so long.</p>

                        <p>One of the clerks is away on furlough but I think that be catching leisure moments I
                                    may be able to get a letter written before the mail goes out, tonight. I think the
                                    General should be sent to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> again (and take me with him) to keep those butternuts, copperheads,
                                    &amp; c., in their proper places. I don't know what has be-come of
                                    Tebo—I wrote him befor I went home on furlough, and have not heard a word
                                    from him since. Think he must have left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and not received my letter. Have you got an answer yet?</p>
                        <p>About that correspondent. I have not seen a letter yet. Did you find it hard work to
                                    get a young lady who would write to a strange soldier?</p>
                        <p>You asked me how I was to spend Christmas and I will tell you. Of course you know it
                                    was Sunday. On that day we do no work except to appoint the officer of the Day,
                                    therefore we spent the morning in loafing, after a dinner of cold boiled pork
                                    (salt), hard tack, and coffee we spent the afternoon in the same useful (?)
                                    employment. Just before dark Major Hutchins went out visiting and left me as A. A.
                                    Genl. to stay in his tent until he returned. There I found an interesting book and
                                    passed the evening in reading. I have not had so <hi rend="i">blue</hi> a day since
                                    I have been in the Army as that was.</p>
                        <p>New Year's Day was a little better. On New Year's Eve the clerks in
                                    the other office got 3 canteens of whiskey and about mid-night raised the old Nick
                                    and when I went in and tried to stop them, they wanted me to have a dance. We (in
                                    the A. A. G. 0.) sat up until 2 o'clock, and got up a fine piece of
                                    penmanship. (It was not written with a quill, and I don't wish you to
                                    consider this a sample) which we scrolled and fixed up with birds, eagles,
                                    &amp;c. &amp;c. and laid it on Major Hutchin's table before he got
                                    up in the morning.</p>
                        <p>We had determined that we would not have so poor a dinner, as that on Christmas, and
                                    had accordingly got flour, apples, raisins, &amp;c. and had two gigantic
                                    dumplings (it took two camp kettles to boil them in) and as there was no wine, had a
                                    whiskey sauce instead. I thought I was temperance man enough, but one of the clerks
                                    was so extremely temperate that he had to have some sauce made especially <list type="footnotes">

                                    Hutchins sent in Christmas Eve from a demijohn that was sent him by some friends in <placeName>

                        <p>Is your sister at college now? I hope she does not get hold of any of my letters, for
                                    they are a strange mixed up mess of stuff.</p>
                        <p>The boxes which should have been here a week ago came along last night, and we have
                                    accordingly been having a New Year's dinner today.</p>
                        <p>I don't think I have told you of the change in rank of several of this
                                    staff. O. B. W. is now Brevt. Maj. Genl. Richards a Bvt. Major as also Capt.
                                    Hutchins, and Brackett is not only a Bvt. Capt. but also a Capt. by Commission in
                                    the 57<hi rend="i">th</hi> Mass.</p>
                        <p>Geo. Hall is still in the land of the living and about the same as ever.</p>
                        <p>Do you ever go to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>? If you do, and will call at No. 1 Alvords Block on Penn. St., you will
                                    find a Miss Webster who will at any time be glad to hear any thing from Knowles or
                                    tell you anything she may have heard concerning him. I believe 'that I gave
                                    you a note to carry to her when you left us in Term. One year ago tonight Genl Grant
                                    spent at our Head Qrs. near Maynardsville <hi rend="sup">33</hi> How many things
                                    have happened since then, and how those who were then together are now separated.
                                    But I must not be getting sentimental. It is 9 o'clock P. M. and I have
                                    done better than I expected in catching moments to write. I have now got to get up
                                    an order convening a court martial, and must be at work so as to get to bed.</p>

                        <p>Yours of the 22d ult. came to hand in due season, and as you wished me to write soon
                                    I will improve this first opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Am glad to hear that young ladies like my penmanship, though I cannot remember
                                    writing to any of them. However, should be very happy to have an opportunity of
                                    seeing a specimen from them with a few words of encouragement and a name and
                                    address. Do you think any of those fair 'demoiselles would condescend to do
                                    me this favor?</p>
                        <p>I didn't know that I was writing to a "<hi rend="i">pupp</hi>", and "can't see it" yet. Perhaps
                                    that is because the afternoon is almost gone, and "daylight now is fading

                        <p>There, Tom, you have made a mistake for once in your life, if never before. Miss
                                    Webster is no more a friend to me than any other of my lady acquaintances, in fact
                                    not quite so much of a friend as some I could mention, and I am most happy to assure
                                    you that she <hi rend="i">never will be</hi> nearer than she is now. I'll
                                    not trouble you to call there, until I get another letter and see how the land lies.
                                    I get along very comfortable in thinking I have—</p>
                        <p>No one to love, none to caress:</p>
                        <p>None to respond to this heart's tenderness except a few honorable
                                    exceptions.</p>
                        <p>But I am getting too sentimental for this letter, and think I will come down, and see
                                    if I can write a little more sensibly.</p>
                        <p>Let me see! You asked for the staff. Surgeon O'Connell left us last
                                    November, and is now in charge of the General Hospital at Hart Island, <placeName>

                                    </placeName> Harbor, and I understand that he likes [it] there very much, not having
                                    much to do, and plenty of time to promenade <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Surg. Hogan Ussols is our Medical Director, and he has a clerk who was
                                    a physician when at home.</p>
                        <p>Brevet Major Hutchins is still with us and is about the same as when we were in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName>. His wound, received at the Wilderness on the 6<hi rend="i">th</hi> of
                                    May last, has not yet healed, and is so troublesome that he's confined to
                                    his tent, and to his bed also, nearly all the time. If he does not get any better
                                    soon, he will have to go home.</p>
                        <p>The General and Brackett are away on leave and Bvt. Major Richards is Judge Advocate
                                    of the Division.</p>
                        <p>I can't stop to write any more now for there is a citizen here just from
                                    home and I must go out and hear how the folks are.</p>
                        <p>Hoping that I shall hear from you again as soon as convenient, I remain,</p>

                                    words now as we are to be relieved in the morning by a Div. of niggers and I suppose
                                    we shall at once take the front again. The 2<hi rend="i">d</hi> Brig, of this Div.
                                    was the first to enter this city yesterday morning, and this Div. was left to guard
                                    the city and R. R. while the other troops followed the retreating enemy. This is a
                                    much larger place than <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and there are many fine residences. I shall take heed to your advice.
                                    Only <hi rend="i">four</hi> months and a <hi rend="i">bit</hi> now. Everything looks
                                    bright.</p>
                        <p>The Presdt went to <placeName>

                                    </placeName> this morning.</p>
                        <p>I was not at all downhearted about Miss Webster. She is not of enough account for <hi rend="i">that</hi>, and I should probably never have seen her again any way.</p>
                        <p>Please give my love to your sister. Thought she had forgotten me. Suppose your
                                    brother has gone on with the 2<hi rend="i">d</hi> Corps, and you <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-036-3-108"/> will probably not be able to get a letter from him very
                                    soon. Excuse this paper, it is the first that came to hand.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
                                    Gen. Grant has gone on with the Army. When I write again I hope to be able to say
                                    that the C. S. A, is gone under. Gen. Potter is badly wounded. You will remember
                                    that we relieved him from command of the Corps at Straw-berry Plains. My paper is
                                    full and I have no more spare time.</p>

                        <salute>Friend Tom,<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
                        </salute>
                        <p>Your letter, before me, is dated April 25th, and here I am answering on the 14th of
                                    May—Well, I consider that <hi rend="i">almost</hi> worthy of a Court
                                    Martial for "neglect of duty." Just prefer charges and it will be
                                    an easy matter to have me tried, as there are twenty-five courts martial now in
                                    session in this city.</p>
                        <p>Let me see, I wrote you last from the city of Petersburg.—What a change
                                    there has been since I left the Friend House in front of Petersburg to go into the
                                    city on the morning of the 3d. of April. First came the chase and capture of Lee,
                                    and then, while rejoicing was at its height, came the news of the nation's
                                    great loss. I suppose it was all for the best, but if it was, I want it also to be
                                    for the best to string up those who are now having their trial down to the arsenal.
                                    This Division, after stopping two days in Petersburg, went out on the South Side
                                    Rail Road and did guard duty until April 20<hi rend="i">th</hi> when the corps left
                                    the front and came to this city. The Dept. of Washington has been divided into
                                    Districts, Genl. Parke commands the 1<hi rend="i">st</hi> and Genl. Wilcox the 2<hi rend="i">d</hi> as also the Division—The A. A. G's. Office
                                    of the Division is in the City, and the rest of the Offices are out with the
                                    Division, so your humble servant is a bummer in the renowned city of red tape <hi rend="sup">37</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You speak of the death of Genl. Potter. He was very severely wounded in the groin,
                                    but the last I heard from him, he was doing well. Captain Hutchins is still in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName>, but we hope to have him back with us before long. There was an
                                    operation performed, and he came very nearly not living through it, as he had a
                                    slight attack of the lockjaw. None of the staff have been injured in the late
                                    engagements, and they are all doing their best for a good time now—</p>
                        <p>There has been a general rejoicing today over Jeff Davis' capture, the news
                                    of which came last night.</p>
                        <p>The Chronicle of this morning began the first report of the great trial—
                                    There will be much of interest in the reports, though we shall probably not get the
                                    full particulars of the trial until they are published by the War Department.</p>

                        <salute>Friend Tom:</salute>
                        <p>Your letter has not been very promptly answered for two reasons: first, because it
                                    was directed to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and did not reach there before I left, and consequently was not
                                    received until quite late; and secondly, because my coming home after so long an
                                    absence has made me feel much more like spending my time in talking than writing.</p>
                        <p>On the 8<hi rend="i">th</hi> ult. the 64<hi rend="i">th</hi> Mass. Vols. was mustered
                                    out and ordered to Readville,—the state rendezvous—I, with six
                                    others of my company who had been detailed as clerks got separate transportation on
                                    an order from Corps Hd.Qrs., and came home on our own hook. Charlie Chase was one of
                                    the party. You will remember him as the Hosp. Steward of the Corps when you was with
                                    us in Tenn. We started twenty-four hours later than the reg. but passed them in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName> and came on home where we arrived on Saturday evening (the 10<hi rend="i">th</hi>). On Monday our old comrades who had been discharged during the
                                    three years, got up a reception and dinner for my company, and on the next day the
                                    whole regiment was received in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Worcester</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, after which we were dismissed to meet again and be paid off on the
                                        22<hi rend="i">d</hi> of June.</p>
                        <p>After we were paid off I looked around for work and obtained a situation, on the 3<hi rend="i">d</hi> inst., as asst. book keeper in a dry goods house in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Have been constantly at work since that date and feel a little run
                                    down under the confinement, but like it very well thus far.</p>

                        <p>I was called away Sunday evening, and as we went out serenading last evening, my
                                    letter is two days old. When my company went away [to war] we had a glee club of
                                    about twelve voices, and the four that have reached home in safety have an
                                    occasional sing to remember old scenes by.</p>
                        <p>I suppose that by this time your brother has been mustered out. I hope so at least.</p>

                        <p>Your last came to hand in due season, and I was very glad to hear of your present
                                    prosperity and future prospects, and to know, from that, that soldiers are not
                                    considered to be a demoralized set of vagabonds as a great many here seem to think.
                                    It is almost impossible now for a young man to get a good and lucrative position who
                                    has passed his three years in the army.</p>
                        <p>I know several young men who have tried to obtain employment, both here and in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName>, to whom the answer has been, "We don't employ
                                        soldiers."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I am getting along about as usual. Last week I was laid up for a few days and tried
                                    hard to have a fever, but a good constitution, with the help of a Dr., brought me
                                    through and enabled me to come to work this morning as usual.</p>
                        <p>The trade in dry goods is getting a little dull as the season advances, and I expect
                                    that soon we shall have a little more spare time in the store.</p>
                        <p>The difference between my three past winters and the present one is much greater than
                                    I expected, and even now a greatcoat is a comfort in my walks over the bridge
                                    morning and evening.</p>
                        <p>I should be much pleased to accept your invitation for me to visit you if I could so
                                    arrange matters as to go, but for the present business must come before pleasure.

                                    doubt have an opportunity to open her arms.</p>
                        <p>There is not very much of anything going on here at present. The places of amusement
                                    seem to be doing a thriving business, and we certainly have nothing to complain of
                                    in the way of numbers, for there are ten (10) different theatres, minstrel troops,

                        <p>July has brought with it some splendid weather, and therefore everyone seems to be in
                                    good humor this morning, altho' trade is getting into its dull season, and
                                    people are leaving for the country. If nothing prevents, I shall leave here next
                                    week for a two weeks stay at Cape Cod.</p>
                        <p>Everything has been going quietly with me this season. My evenings are spent mostly
                                    in singing, either at some friend's house, or serenading some fair dam-sel.
                                    I always think of Indiana about the 4th of July and recall the pleasant three months
                                    spent there in '63— It does not seem three years since I left <placeName>

                        <p>Mrs. Throop has been urging me for several weeks to write to you, and in compliance
                                    with her repeated importunities to-day, I have concluded to spend a portion of this
                                    lovely Sabbath Evening in conversing with you upon paper. Epistolary writing has
                                    become quite a task of late, mainly to be attributed, no doubt, to the confining
                                    nature of my present business, and its influence upon my health, which has suffered
                                    materially of late. Indeed if it were not from sheer necessity, I would abandon it,
                                    and follow a more healthful and intellectual pursuit, and one more congenial to my
                                    taste, and inclination. But we are in a good degree creatures of circumstances, or

                        <p>Well, John, we are Tavern-Keeping. We took possession of the Junction House, on the
                                        1<hi rend="i">st</hi> day of November last, and have had a very considerable
                                    share of Custom, taking the location and the season of the year into the account.</p>
                        <p>But it adds very materially to the weight of my cares and bears more heavily still
                                    upon Mrs. Throop. We are, however, not discouraged, inasmuch as we hope to make it
                                    in some degree profit-able. Our expenses are very heavy, with all the care and
                                    economy we can use but we rather think we shall be able to make something by the

                                    that it is not a situation calculated in its nature to assist in the cultivation of
                                    personal piety and devotional exercises. I trust, however, that it may not cause me
                                    to decline (much farther, at least,) in my religious enjoyments or to back slide
                                    altogether from the Christian Course I have thus long been striving to pursue.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Correspondence between Benjamin Harrison and James G. Blaine</hi>, 1882-1893.
                    Collected and edited by Albert T. Volwiler. The American Philosophical Society, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

            <p>This volume of letters is a by-product of a long period of study devoted to the life of Benjamin
                    Harrison preparatory to the production of a biography of that leader. From the time that Harrison
                    became a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator until the more famous Blaine served under him as Secretary of State, their
                    paths frequently crossed. The brilliant man from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>, though widely known before Harrison rose to prominence, lost his race for the
                    presidency in 1884 by a few hundred popular votes in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, while the able attorney from Indiana won in 1888 by a slender margin in the electoral
                    college. These two leaders of the same party were brought into more direct relations after Blaine
                    was given the first place in Harrison's Cabinet. It seemed almost impossible for the
                    younger leader as President not to make the older leader Secretary of State, a place which the
                    latter felt was his by right. Nevertheless, the arrangement led to an awkward and perhaps inevitable
                    estrangement. All this and much more, the author brings out in his "Introduction."
                    The correspondence, which reveals the relations existing between Harrison and Blaine, through a
                    decade, is especially valuable to students of the career of the latter because of the well-known
                    scarcity of Blaine material.</p>
            <p>In collecting, editing, and briefly interpreting this corresponse, Dr. Volwiler has rendered a very
                    distinct service to students of the political history of the period covered. The
                    "Preface" contains statements which should prove very interesting to historical
                    workers, especially to struggling graduate students who have so much to learn as they deal with
                    sources. The correspondence is arranged in five chapters, each headed simply by the years involved.
                    The "Index" will serve well those <hi rend="i">who may wish to consult the polume.
                        AR who use this correspondence and study</hi> Dr. Volwiler's
                    "Introduction," will look anxiously forward to the publication of his life of
                    Benjamin Harrison.</p>

                    There is a long (forty-one pages) "Introduction" by the editors which is
                    remarkably well written and which shows a keen knowledge of the conditions in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> country of the period just preceding the Seven Years' War. The documents,
                    which belong to the years from the close of the War of the Austrian Succession to 1755, in which
                    year, the military drama which was to serve as a curtain-raiser to the Seven Years' War
                    occurred, are extremely valuable sources for the student of history who wishes to understand the
                    struggle for supremacy in North America between the French and the British.</p>
            <p>Though most of the documents are French letters (all of which are accompanied by translations), there
                    are a few English documents. The manuscripts, or photostat copies of originals, were mainly obtained

                    the part of the editors, who have attempted with evident success "to document as
                    elaborately as possible" the period from 1747 to 1755 "as it was reflected in the <placeName>

                    headings. There is an adequate index. Including the difficult task of translating the French
                    documents, many of them <hi rend="i">written by uneducated men</hi>, it is hard to see how the

               <hi rend="i">Schoolmaster of Yesterday</hi> is a book of a reminiscent nature dealing with three
                    school-masters of one family, who together taught in the Schools of Indiana for about a hundred
                    years. The volume has recently come from Whittlesey House (a division of the McGraw-Hill Book
                    Company, N. Y.) <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-036-3-115"/> It runs to 359 pages and sells for
                    $2.75. The first of the three schoolmen was Thomas Kennedy, who began teaching in 1820;
                    the second was Benjamin ("Ben") Kennedy; and the third was Millard Fillmore
                    Kennedy, who retired in 1919, but who is still living on a farm near Trafalgar, Indiana. Thomas
                    Kennedy taught for a while in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. In his last period of service, Mil-lard F. Kennedy taught in the Trafalgar High
                    School.</p>
            <p>The narrative runs as if from the pen of Millard F. Kennedy, but he had as a collaborator Alvin F.
                    Harlow, an author of considerable experience. It is fair to assume that the third of the Kennedy
                    schoolmasters furnished the information about his own career, what he knew personally about the
                    careers of his father and grandfather, and the sources from which further facts were drawn relative
                    to the two earlier pedagogues of the family. It must also be assumed, no doubt, that the actual
                    writing and the literary quality of the book are to be ascribed to the collaborator, Mr. Harlow.
                    Personal history is popular today, and this story of the experiences of three Hoosier teachers
                    through a rapidly changing century should interest many readers in and out of Indiana. The three
                    Kennedys spanned the period from the crudest frontier stage of the Middle West to the year of the <placeName>

                    fields as well as in education, is enlivened by interesting <hi rend="i">incidents pertaining to
                        school-room activities</hi> of the earlier and later periods. Any reader can while away a number

                    laid in southern Indiana, and the story includes "Copper-heads" along with ardent
                    supporters of the war. The hero of the romance is Richard ("Dick") Clayton, who
                    was too young to become a soldier. His father was a Union soldier, who, after he had lost an arm,
                    returned to his home in Indiana. This Union soldier's best friend became a leading
                    "Copperhead." The ties between the Clayton's and their neighbor, who
                    became very seriously involved with the federal government, and his family were very close. <hi rend="i">Governor</hi>

                    who played parts in that stormy period are brought into the story. The author's aim has
                    been to portray the intricate relationships that existed between persons who necessarily clashed
                    during the war but who remained deeply concerned about each other. This is the new note in the
                    simple but tragic tale. The author tries to stick closely to the historical facts and does quite
                    well. When handling materials that trained historical workers have a hard time to evaluate, the
                    author of a romance naturally treads on slippery ground. The purpose of the book is good, however,
                    and the author succeeds in demonstrating that not all the good nor all the bad was to be found in
                    either the characters of the patriots or those who disagreed with them.</p>

            <byline>WILLIAM O. LYNCH</byline>
            <p>The conditions prevailing in Indiana in 1890 were quite different from those of 1865. When I invited
                    readers to take a look at Hoosierdom in 1840 and in 1865, I was writing about situations that I knew
                    nothing about from personal observation. In the year 1890, I had been out of high school for a short
                    time. I had not yet been able to go to college, except for a four-months course in <hi rend="i">bookkeeping</hi> that I had taken in a business college. I had found no satisfactory job, and I
                    fear that I took life too seriously for one of my age. I read everything that I could get my hands
                    on in the time that I had at my disposal, but that did not mean a great deal. <hi rend="i">My
                        opportunity</hi> to learn by observation was also sadly limited. I could not travel any and my
                    contacts with people who could have enlightened me in regard to current domestic and world problems
                    were too few. <hi rend="i">What I say about Indiana</hi> as it was a half century ago, must be based
                    largely on what I have learned during the past fifty years.</p>
            <p>The McKinley Tariff Act and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act were passed in 1890, and Hoosiers like
                    most other citizens of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> believed that the tariff and money issues were fundamental. It is interesting to
                    reflect today on how little the leaders of the nation sensed what the coming years would bring in
                    the way of economic developments. Benjamin Harrison of Indiana was in the midst of his presidential
                    term. As an able lawyer, he had won political support by his vigorous defense of the existing
                    economic system. He was cold, relentless and uncompromising in his logic. Like nearly all of his
                    class in his day, he was certain that there was nothing wrong with this great country except that it
                    was infested by a good many people who argued vehemently that there were defects in our economic
                    system and offered their panaceas to the public. To Harrison, it was the panaceas that were
                    dangerous, not the alleged defects in our social and economic set-up. Had the able and honest
                    conservative leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties of the 'eighties and
                    'nineties made a determined effort to discover the disease instead of fighting the
                    symptoms, they <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-036-3-118"/> might have rendered better service to the
                    generation that was to follow them.</p>
            <p>General Alvin P. Hovey was Governor of Indiana in 1890, having been elected in 1888. He died in
                    November, 1891, and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Ira J. Chase. Even to citizens who were
                    living then, these names almost fail to register. It is only to a few of those who reach high
                    stations that history gives more than a line or two. Indiana governors are elected in the years of
                    presidential contests, and, almost invariably, the party that carries the state for its national
                    ticket elects its candidate for governor. In a number of presidential contests since the Civil War,
                    Indiana, being a very doubtful state, played a significant part. Its electoral votes were vigorously
                    sought. The contest of 1888 found the major parties running neck and neck in the country as a whole.
                    Money was poured into pivotal. Indiana, where that election was one to which we can not point back
                    with pride. Vote buying had become common even in country districts and citizens of high standing in
                    both parties indulged in the purchase of "floaters," though one party was able in
                    that campaign, when the protective tariff was the main issue, to raise much more money than the
                    other. The plurality of Harrison over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1888 was less than 2500 votes. In 1892, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> carried the state by a plurality a little above 7000. Clearly Indiana was a close state
                    fifty years ago.</p>
            <p>Mainly as a result of the political corruption of 1888, but partly because the reform was spreading
                    over the land, the Indiana Legislature passed the Australian Ballot Act in 1889. I distinctly recall
                    the voting as it was done in 1888 and earlier, when each party prepared its own ballots for the
                    printer. A voter could deposit his ballot in the ballot-box, taking it already folded from his
                    pocket, or he could get it at the window of the polling room and fold it in the presence of others.
                    If a "floater", he could receive his ballot from a vote buyer, or one who
                    understood the bargain that had been made, and deposit it in the box under the scrutiny of the
                    interested watcher. It can be readily understood how the Australian Ballot, though not perfect, is
                    far better than the so-called secret balloting system which it superceded.</p>
            <p>The population of Indiana by the census of 1890 was 2,192,404, the gain for the decade being much
                    smaller than for any previous decade since that from 1820 to' 1830. The <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-036-3-119"/> state was gaining, but not rapidly. It seemed that Indiana was destined
                    to remain mainly agricultural. This would mean that the state would escape extensive industrialism
                    with rapid growth of urban centers. It would also mean that a very large percentage of the young
                    people born and reared in the state would be drawn away year by year and decade by decade. In truth,
                    while there has been industrial expansion in the state, the growth in population has not been rapid
                    since 1890. Following the census of 1870, the number of members in the <hi rend="i">national House
                        of Representatives was increased</hi> from eleven to thirteen, giving Indiana fifteen
                    presidential electors. Since that increase, there has never been another but because of the relative
                    rate of population growth, a decrease came after 1930. The number of Representatives being reduced
                    to twelve, Indiana elected but fourteen electors in 1932 and in 1936, and will choose that number in
                    the present year.</p>
            <p>To the new generation of today, the Indiana of 1890 must seem more like that of 1865, or 1840, than
                    like the present Indiana. Life in this new stream-lined age seems to center so much around
                    automobiles, radios, moving pictures, airplanes, electrical appliances, purchases wrapped in
                    cellophane and mechanized warfare that existence in 1890 would seem like living in another world or
                    age. Nevertheless, something can be said in favor of the situation in that faraway time. Food,
                    clothing, fuel, leisure, entertainment, books, education-all these could be had at much less expense
                    than now. To a great degree, the essentials of a comfortable and interesting life were available to
                    people in that day. It is to a large extent the multitude of non-essentials, which must be obtained
                    at any sacrifice now, that were lacking to the people of 1890. Furthermore, it must be admitted that
                    the marvelous inventions that have come in the last fify years are not all beneficial to mankind.
                    Indeed, some of them lend themselves so readily to the destruction of life and property, that one
                    fears, at times, that civilization may not survive man's own ingenuity.</p>
            <p>Our Indiana of fifty years ago was no paradise, but it was possible to live happily and wholesomely.
                    Our educational system had reached a high level. It was necessary to struggle in order to succeed,
                    but one could fight the battles of life with a good deal of hope. The world was not in such a hurry
                        <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-036-3-120"/> as now, but there was a great deal of virtue in the lower
                    tempo of that day. We can never go back to the conditions of fifty years ago. No people have ever
                    recaptured a vanished golden age. In fact, no such age ever existed. Nevertheless, the people of
                    every new era can and should reach back into the past and regain good things that have been
                    discarded or lost, if possible, when more valuable than the things that have replaced them. It is
                    some of the finer, intangible features of life that I am thinking about. When these are sought
                    after, many past periods are rich mines that may be profitably worked.</p>

            <p>John Steele, the eldest son, was born on January 25, 1761. He served as a private in the

                    Bruce married (2) Hetty R. Holmes, daughter of William and Elizabeth Ann Holmes, by whom he had ten
