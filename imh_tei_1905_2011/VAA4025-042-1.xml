            <p>Writing under the mellifluous title "Musketo Bait, Our Country, Her People, Their
                    Character," Concordia said: "This is a very great country of ours—a
                    very great country— great in its extent, great in the grandeur of her
                    mountains— more than great in her far reaching rivers, her wide spread forest, and vast
                    fields—but great, truly more than great, <hi rend="i">greater than all others, is the
                        character of those who dwell within her wide and extended limits."</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Perhaps this writer who was swept so completely off foot by his superlatives had a keen
                    understanding of what was taking place around him. There may be ample room for long and tedious
                    arguments about the exact meaning of the frontier in American history. Scholarly gentlemen may sit
                    for long hours in smoke-ladened and overheated hotel rooms and argue the question of the influence
                    of the West in American history, with one crowd holding to one thesis and the other refuting it, but
                    one thing they can agree upon, there were backwoodsmen.</p>
            <p>From the great valleys of the Appalachians to the broad lands beyond the <placeName>

                    </placeName> there were thousands of backwoodsmen. The rivers swarmed with them as they steered
                    their clumsy craft toward free land and new adventures. The trails reverberated with their
                    boisterous shouts, oaths, and laughter. Much of the great West had become a land of
                    semi-dispossessed people who were throwing themselves upon the country's resources hoping
                    ever for the better. New terms like "pulling up stakes" and
                    "gittin’ on" became vital parts of the backwoodsman's everyday
                    speech. As the author of "Musketo Bait" said, they formed "the

                    restless souls who moved westward were in the process of creating a new national personality. In
                    adapting themselves to their new environment they threw off many of the superficial habits and
                    customs of another society and adjusted themselves to the necessities of their immediate situations.
                    Life for them had assumed a new reality, and they had neither time nor conveniences with which to
                    cultivate the superficialities of older communities.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The spirit of the frontier on the whole was one of rough good-natured cordiality and hospitality. A
                    backwoodsman meant what he said when he greeted new arrivals with "Light stranger! light
                    and hang your horse to a tree—walk in— we'll spare you some liquor,
                    and gin you something to gnaw on. We're pretty thick about here now, and some on us is
                    sorter gwine to marry each other, I'm gwine to hang myself to that red-haired gal in the

            <p>Nowhere else was the stranger more welcome than at the door of the settler's cabin. It might
                    be that the house was already crowded to overflowing, but there was always a free will to
                    "scrouge over" and make room for another benighted visitor. A traveler who found
                    himself stranded deep on the American frontier in the forties inquired of a householder if he might
                    spend the night and received the <list type="footnotes">

                    necessary as a bed for the master, but it was a little too much to ask the host who was barefooted
                    and in his night shirt to "cut the <hi rend="i">roughness."</hi> Inside the cabin
                    the "old lady" informed the newcomer that "We have had a
                    quiltin’ stranger and there's a power of young folks in the house, and mostly
                    gals too—Find a place to sleep, if you can, but it's mighty unsartin."
                    By the flickering light of the fire there were visible the sleeping forms of ten or a dozen persons
                    of both sexes resting on bedsteads and on the floor, but soon the sprawling hulk of an overgrown boy
                    was spotted and the weary sojourner crawled in beside him and was off "to the land of
                        nod."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Everywhere the newcomer was greeted with the same offhand extension of hospitality, and with the same
                    absence of excuse making. A Tennessean greeted a horseman, whose nag's feet were worn
                    tender, and who had asked the priviledge of resting a day or two to give the animal an opportunity
                    to mend, with, "Well Stranger, I jest can; but, Stranger can you eat hog and hominy and
                    drink corn?"<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The old West was truly a land of log cabin
                    democracy. A major portion of its population was on the move, and a man who had stationed himself on
                    a piece of land had no intention of remaining in his present circumstances longer than was
                    absolutely necessary. The settler was driven forward by the great sentiment of America on the move,
                    which was a burning desire "to better his condition." A father saw his gawky son
                    growing to manhood, and his hope was that the boy would do better than he, and "doing
                    better" was more than a matter of just getting along."</p>

                    classifying the various personalities and characteristics were originated. A rugged boatman who took
                    the river by storm, and who spent his first days among the down-river French communities tearing
                    things apart in his own particular way was called a "Kentuckian." It soon
                    developed that every rowdy who went on a, "bender" in the lower-river towns was
                    looked upon as a "Kentuckian" whether he had ever seen that state or not. All that
                    was necessary to get him in that class was to be crudely dressed, two-thirds drunk, unshaven,
                    unwashed, and ready as he expressed it, for a "little mite of fun" on his own
                    terms. Kentuckians themselves considered that they were "hosses" and everyone
                    around them was a "hoss." The most powerful thing in their lives, outside of the
                    "ol’ Massasip," and thunder and lightning, was a horse. It was not
                    enough to be a "hoss," but it was necessary to be a real genuine "red
                    hoss," and so they called themselves when they wished to be especially emphatic. This term
                    had a real meaning to a large segment of the backwoods people.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    populated the country, but so did Yankees and other upriver folk with the result that a new

                    of his fine land was even more narrated abroad. A hoard of porcine British, European, and Yankee

                    what they saw. They wore their feelings pinned to their coat sleeves, and hopefully expected to have
                    them injured. Charles J. Latrobe, an Englishman, said they were to be met with along the roads and

                    hurried trips into the backwoods and rushed home to write the only "true picture of

            </p>
            <p>As has always been true of provincial Americans, the backwoodsmen were great practical jokers. Their
                    first impulse has ever been to make things look as bad as possible to a naive and disgruntled
                    stranger. An old joke which had grown hoary with age and mud before the first decade of the
                    nineteenth century ended, and ever attracted the attention of the gullible traveler who wished to
                    believe the worst, was the one of a man stuck so deep in a mudhole that only his hat showed above
                    the surface of the ground. When a Britisher tipped his hat over with a riding whip the backwoodsman
                    growled, "‘Hullo, stranger! who told you to knock my hat
                    off?’" An offer of assistance brought the self-assured
                    reply,"’ "Oh, never mind, I'm in rather a <hi rend="i">bad
                    fix</hi> it is true, but I have an excellent horse under me, who has carried me through many a worse
                    place than this—we shall get along.’ "<hi rend="sup">13</hi> That mud
                    was plentiful is an indisputable fact, and that it was an obstacle in the way of all who traveled in
                    the backwoods goes without saying. But it is doubtful that roads ever got as bad as the figure of
                    speech of the backwoodsman who said it would "bog a buzzard's shadow," or
                    ever as discouraging as Thomas Hulme said he found it. On June 28, 1819, he wrote an English friend
                    that, "Before we got to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> we had to cross a swamp of half a mile wide; we were obliged to lead our horses, and
                    walk up to the knees in mud and water. Before we got half across we began to think of going back;
                    but, there is a sound bottom under it all, and we waded through it as well we could."
                    Later, James Hall commented that if Hulme waded through mud leading his horse behind him then he did
                    so because he liked it. It was his impression that the Englishman could have <list type="footnotes">

                    humanity, and sharp elbows were all irksome. Many of those who came to see the backwoods were
                    confused and harassed by superficialities. They had never learned two basic facts before they left
                    home. First, that frontiersmen were on the move; the people were looking to the future and cared
                    little for the immediate present, or had little reverence for the past. That backwoodsmen had few
                    traditions, few social amenities, and little doubt of their own ability to deal with circumstances.
                    It never occurred to the average frontiersman that his personal habits, table manners, mode of
                    speaking or general appearance was anything to excite a stranger. Where the French and English
                    peasants were tractable, governable, and meticulous, the American was careless about his dress, his
                    homestead and his manners. As one of his most sympathetic historians has said, he was
                    "blunt, straightforward, and independent in discourse." He was
                    "intractable, beyond control." Where others were more careful about appearances,
                    but more timid in the face of circumstances, the American backwoodsman was master. Instead of
                    yielding to circumstance he made circumstance yield to him. When the forest got in his way he
                    slashed his way through it with ax and fire. When the river got rough with him he bared his arms,
                    shouted his choicest epithets, and brought it to bay with flat and steamboats. When an adversary
                    challenged him he gritted his teeth, lowered his head and charged headlong with the roar and fury of
                    a bull.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>When the backwoodsman was "riled up"’ he became a vertiable volcano on
                    legs. Perhaps the first bit of tough backwoods talk ever recorded was that by Christian Schultz.

                    that the authors of descriptions of America were unable to distinguish between pocketknives and what
                    the backwoodsmen called dirks. Charles A. Murray in his book, <hi rend="i">Travels in North

                    speak otherwise than with unqualified reprobation— I mean the cowardly and almost
                    universal practice of carrying a dirk-knife." This instrument was displayed on every
                    occasion just as one might display a walking cane, said the Englishman, and, "I have seen
                    several well-dressed Kentuckians, who probably think themselves much injured if they were not
                    considered gentlemen of the first grade picking their teeth with these elegant pocket companions in

            <p>Certainly the disgruntled Faux had not left all of these objectionable features behind, because in a
                    short time he was to learn that although he had moved into another state he was among the same
                    people in fact. They carried dirks and occasionally used them whether in picking their teeth or in
                    slashing a neighbor. In Indiana, Charles Sealsfield saw me Hoosier knife another one over a bit of
                    complicity of a marital nature. The cuckold husband was stabbed to death, and his murderer, he said,
                    escaped the gallows by the tactful use of three thousand dollars. Even the friendly American
                    apologist, James Hall, had to admit that "‘a dirk <hi rend="i">is</hi> the
                    constant companion of every gentleman in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    hard to evaluate these characterizations of the backwoodsman. Perhaps everything from a utility
                    pocketknife to the highly lethal bowie knife was a dirk to the writers of the first half of the
                    nineteenth century.</p>

                    aim with their rifles and pistols. The rifle was a symbol of backwoods security, and it was a
                    necessary weapon in every household. So important was the ability to handle a rifle that it early
                    became a matter of political significance. One observer said that in many communities in the West,
                    handling the rifle well was a greater popular asset than having stump-speaking ability. If the
                    candidate for office had a stoop to his shoulders, that was an accepted sign that he had carried a
                    rifle and had worked hard at making a living.</p>
            <p>Occasionally a jubilant son of the border released steam by firing his pistol into the air letting
                    out Indian yells that would curdle the blood of the tenderhearted. It is not difficult to imagine
                    the feeling of an Englishman who was "supping upon slices of bacon, roasted corn bread, and
                    some milk" when his host and a companion returned from a horse race and proceeded to fire
                    their pistols before dismounting.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

                    directly to the point was a prime virtue, the shotgun was a little too modern and untried. This
                    stranger said "The people scorn a weapon less deadly than the rifle, and practice has made
                    them remarkably expert in the use of this national arm." A native son said that it

            <p>The open display of weapons was startling, of course, but those pestiferous authors who were so
                    busily engaged in criticizing the backwoodsmen for what they considered a flagrant breach of good
                    human conduct seldom took time to discover the reason for such a practice. The foreigner who was so
                    impressed by the display of guns had little conception of the experience through which the country
                    was passing in the process of settlement.</p>
            <p>Coupled with the open and free use of knives and guns was the constant imbibing of liquor, and
                    numerous descriptions of the backwoodsmen refer to their heavy drinking. In fact, so much point is

                    liquor was as much a matter of popular acceptance as drinking spring water. A little shot of
                    "old Mononghahela" or the caged lightning from the head of the hollows of
                    Ol’ Kaintuck was sufficient to make the most lackadaisical backwoodsman the equal of his
                    peers any day in the week. Drinking liquor in many communities was taken for granted, even if the
                    mode of drinking seldom conformed to the strictest code of sanitation. The Englishman who was so
                    rudely drawn away from the dinner table by his host's firing off a brace of pistols was
                    invited to have "a snort" with the boys. The Kentuckian stood.</p>

                        took from the slave the can with water, and handed the bottle to me, the mouth of which had

            <p>No one ever denied the prevalence of drinking on the frontier. A most sympathetic observer said that

                    at the bottle then there was something to the contention. He believed that "in the West and

                            consequence, this habit was made a matter of record in travel accounts, and in the numerous
                            frontier tales which were published. Many of the newspaper stories and those appearing in

                    </quote>Certainly the backwoodsmen were not sensitive on this score. Swearing to them was a natural
                    thing, and it let off, in the words of the "real things," "a power of

            <p>Not alone in drinking and swearing did the backwoodsmen come under the scrutiny of both their critics
                    and defenders, but likewise their table manners were "a caution" to everybody who
                    took time to observe them. There was never any doubt in the backwoodsman's mind as to why
                    he took his seat at the table. He was eating to live, and dining for him was as much a businesslike
                    proposition as was cutting a ring around a white oak tree in order to get it off the land, the
                    building of a house, or sitting on the jury. His whole philosophy of dining could be summed up in
                    the specific formula of "set down, eat, git up, pick your teeth and go." Or,
                    perhaps, the art of dining was more eloquently analyzed by a native son who was in the throes of
                    excitement of a party when he prefaced his announcement that "the vittles was
                    ready" with the jovial statement that "nives is scace, so what thar is leave to

            <p>Certainly nowhere else in the civilized world could man be assured of a more abundant supply of
                    substantial food than in the American backwoods. As one observer noted, it was not much of a job for
                    the average frontier housewife, within an hour's notice, to spread before her guests
                    "a plenteous meal of ham, fried chicken, eggs, milk, honey, delicious butter, boiled maize
                    and hot wheaten bread."<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Not alone were these foods readily available
                    but it was not impossible in most places to find enough game meat to amplify the diet. Yet the food,
                    like the people, was made a subject of frequent criticism. Visitors were often unsympathetic and
                    ignorant of the methods of preparing meals. Even in the face of bounteous feasts there were those
                    selfish stubborn travelers who demanded still more. They didn't like the hard liquors, they
                    found American wine abominable, they scoffed at the coffee, especially that which was made from
                    grain, and damned the American backwoods ignoramus who knew little or nothing about the more
                    sophisticated European and English beverage, tea. One such stranger asked a backwoods family to make
                    some tea for him, and supplied a pound of fine hysom leaves which he had carefully hoarded, but to
                    his utter amazement and disgust when he seated himself at the table the cook had boiled the tea
                    leaves in the same manner as greens, and the host said "stranger, these ar’

            </p>
            <p>Even though the food came in for both praise and criticism, the eating of it was ever a source of
                    wonderment to those who were not used to the businesslike way in which Americans satiated their
                    appetites. <list type="footnotes">

                    etiquette in time, however, were to disturb the Western American mind. The rough and ready preachers
                    were among the first to become conscious of certain indelicate mannerisms. Peter Cartwright lectured
                    Brother Axley until he brought the latter to tears because of his custom of throwing chicken bones

                    fork was no gentleman." In the face of so positive a statement, the president, a man of a
                    slightly compromising turn of mind, ruled that at least "a man who couldn't
                    content himself with one leg on the table and a civilized tooth pick, shouldn't be

                    subjects in the diggings corroborate them. George Caleb Bingham produced paintings which epitomize
                    the surface impressions of raw American democracy. Highly representative bodies of backwoodsmen were
                    assembled together by the artist in the paintings "Electioneering,"
                    "County Election," and "The Verdict of the People." In these
                    group portraits he has been able to record a fascinating portrait of the frontier. There are all the
                    types; the dandy with the long-frocked tail coats, the white bell-crowned hats, the broad stocks and
                    the Wellington boots. There are the homespun constituents with their rumpled-jeans pantaloons and
                    heavy ill-fitting coats, broadbrimmed shapeless hats, and the crude mud-clod crushing brogans. In
                    his other paintings such as "Raftsmen Playing Cards," "Watching the
                    Cargo," and "Shooting for the Beef," Bingham caught the spirit of the
                    backwoods, arid has left a graphic personal picture of its people.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>Going far beyond the mere act of placing on canvass the forms and examples of early American Western
                    dress, George Caleb Bingham was careful to bring into focus in his portraits the whole vital force
                    of Western American democracy. He was able to impart to his canvasses a keen sense of political
                    activities preceding, during, and immediately after a popular election. He has placed his people
                    about on the canvass in such a way that they portray, by their facial expressions, a full sense of
                    the proceedings about them. The keen Yankee face with its pious expression of political uprightness
                    beams forth above a body clad in the plain garments of an honest sincere people. A
                    "sharp" political demagogue dressed in the casual jeans or cassimere frock coat of
                    the dignified backwoodsman pleads with the people behind a face which expresses earnest anxiety to
                    serve the people. To this assemblage are added the countenances and forms of dissolute citizens, and
                    the former are highlighted with the satisfied glow of men who find in both elections and liquor two
                    definite goods which should be preserved and utilized to the fullest extent.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>Many early nineteenth-century books are illustrated with drawings of Uncle Sam in homespun.
                    Especially attractive are those by Louie-Eauerle who illustrated the obscure book <hi rend="i">Brother Mason the Circuit Rider, or, Ten Years A Methodist Preacher</hi>. Looking over the
                    Methodist preacher's shoulder the artist was able literally to portray American
                    backwoodsmen in their most colorful moods. With a keen interest for humanity in its informal poses
                    he was able to reproduce on paper an honest concept of the trials and tribulations of getting along
                    on a Methodist circuit where cord beds, bedbugs, crowded cabins, and wild converts made the tenor of
                    life extremely uncertain.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

            <p>Next to Bingham, Captain Basil Hall of the Royal Navy, has preserved the widest range of backwoods
                    portraits. In a considerable volume of as yet unpublished illustrative material he was able to
                    record faithful <hi rend="i">Camera Lucida</hi> pictures of the life which passed before him on a
                    journey in 1827 and 1828 from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> through the western American frontier to the rice fields of the Carolinas. In 1829 he
                    published forty of his etchings in a delightful book entitled <hi rend="i">Forty Etchings, from
                        Sketches Made with the Camera Lucida, in North America. in 1827 and 1828</hi>. Where his fellow
                    countrymen traveled through the backwoods recording their impressions in notes, Captain Hall was
                    able to carry away with him a more realistic view of the scenes of his travel. Not only did he focus
                    much attention upon the backwoodsman himself, but likewise upon his natural environment and his
                    economic pursuits.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>The Yankee peddler who found his way to almost every cabin on the fringe of settlement was ever an
                    object of entertainment to the settlers. His clacking wagon, gaunt horses, and stock of notions was
                    to the backwoodsmen the soul of American industry and ingenuity. In 1835, John Whetton Ehninger
                    produced his famous painting "Yankee Peddler" which portrays faithfully the
                    process of mercantile transactions in a rural region which was far removed from shopping centers.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>American democracy at work attracted scores of visitors to the backwoods. They came to observe the
                    processes of government at work, or to seek out islands of fresh opportunities for people who had
                    reached a state of impoverishment elsewhere. For hundreds of Europeans, Englishmen, and Eastern
                    Americans the frontier was a region of escape, but before they ventured out to it they wished to
                    know what the country was like. They sent scouts with some literary ability to survey the scene and
                    come home to write books so that all might read the truth. Too, there were those who came to refute
                    the travelers who made the land sound too attractive, but whatever the purpose behind the published
                    accounts there crept into all of them observations on the great political experiment.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>To those who looked upon political institutions as highly formal ones, presided over by men of great
                    dignity the backwoods scene was unbelievable. To an Englishman, for instance, who was accustomed to
                    the pomp and ceremony of his royal government and its local branches, it was extremely shocking to
                    see a judge clad in the ordinary rough clothes of the common people and wearing coarse unpolished
                    shoes presiding over a court. The democratic attitude of complete equality of the constituent toward
                    his officials was almost too much to understand. It seemed inconsistent that an ordinary citizen
                    would treat an official with no more consideration than any other man, except when he was in the act
                    of performing his duty. It was indeed a novelty for one traveler to observe a defendant in a trial

                    home?’" The defendant put his apple aside and replied in meaningful
                    backwoods elegance that, "‘it strikes me mightily.’"<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>Democracy, however informal it might have been, was for the backwoodsman, a vital thing. Often he
                    manifested little concern about the world which lay beyond him so long as its affairs did not affect
                    him. The great political questions of the day, except for those concerning the public lands, were
                    not too exciting. To him the vital issues we "propitious showers for his growing crops, and
                    abundant mast to fatten his hogs, and a good season for hunting," and who was to be elected

                    were slow to forget their animosities. So thoroughly were many of them imbued with the spirit of
                    expansion that they were ever suspicious of John Bull and his ambitions in the western country. In

            <p>Nobody was "afeered" much on the frontier because there was always a civilian army
                    ready to rush into arms on short notice. The citizen hero was proud of his services partly because
                    it was in behalf of his country's interest, and partly because it gave him a thing of
                    dignity which he prized very highly—a title. Any man who could organize a militia company
                    could just about select his title, and the bigger the company the higher his title had to be in
                    order to make room for the men under him. As one contemporary said "the militia
                    leader's title was never less than a colonel, and sometimes brigadier general." A

                            "Silence in the line!" produced a greater clamor than ever, for each

                            When a movement was directed, the order, reached the men successively, by the same process
                            of repetition—so that while some files were walking slowly, and looking back to
                            beckon on their. lagging fellow-soldiers, others were forced to a quick run to regain their
                            places, and the scramble often continued many minutes after the word
                            "halt!" The longer the parade lasted, the worse was the drill; and after a
                            tedious day's "muster," each man hew less, if possible, of

            <p>The backwoodsman is gone, but behind him he has left a colorful folk history. He would swell with
                    pride if he could only get a glimpse of the shelves of rare books which have been written about him,
                    and it would indeed inflate his ego if he could see the anthologies of his stories, and the
                    dictionaries and magazines which contain his colorful words had phrases. Looking back on the
                    American backwoods from a modem perspective it is easy to discern that the coarseness and rugged
                    folkways applied most often to those people who were nearest the outer fringe of settlement. One

                    stopped to think what fate he might have suffered in his own country had he relied upon the cottages
                    of laborers for cover, and upon their meager pantries and cribs to sustain man and horse. Had he
                    done so the contrast might have been startling indeed, and entirely in the American
                    backwoodsman's favor. That the frontiersman made rapid adaptations is one of the
                    American's major accomplishments. He showed his noblest spirit in his hunts, chases, fish
                    fries, barn dances, corn huskings, house raisings and warmings, weddings, infairs, quiltings, and in
                    scores of other matters of neighborly concern. All of these lent interest to the
                    backwoodsman's peaceful hours.</p>
            <p>Not all the popular pictures of the backwoodsman at home portray him as a crude bumpkin making either
                    a comical spectacle or a menace of himself before a smug and more sophisticated public. In the
                    background of even the most critical accounts is the realization that on the American frontier there
                    was a sound backlog of competence and self-assurance which in the end was a basis for a highly
                    stabilized society. Rude though the isolated people of the backwoods were they had the ability to
                    lower themselves gracefully to the common incident, or to rise with certainty to moments of
                    greatness and sincere generosity. Aid to a neighbor in trouble was a moral obligation, and vengeance
                    to a foe was ever a pressing necessity. Rising and falling as they did in those tedious years when
                    they were adapting themselves to new social and political mores, the backwoodsmen were ever
                    conscious not of the days which were, but of those which were to come. Judging harshly of the law at
                    times, and always warping the classic principles of organized government to suit their immediate
                    needs, but never insensitive of the broader objectives of their political institutions. Such were
                    the sturdy backwoodsmen who are worthy of a place in the colorful annals of American history, and in
                    the high esteem of his a newer and even more uncertain age.</p>

                    until the fifteenth year and includes the raising and education of an individual. This is not only
                    an unproductive time, but also the cause of considerable outlay of money. The second or labor
                    period, ranging from fifteen to sixty-five years, is the productive time of life. The third or aged
                    period is unproductive, and the individual is dependent upon his savings or upon the labor of

            <p>German statistical tables indicate that the amount of gold carried by emigrants during the first part
                    of the nineteenth century varied from $76 to $318 for each emigrant. Money,
                    however, was not the only property, but wearing apparel, tools, watches, books, and jewelry were
                    also brought along. It may be estimated that the personal property of the emigrant was one hundred
                    and fifty dollars. Approximately 4,297,980 immigrants arrived at the port of <placeName>

                    through immigration if the capital value of each male and female immigrant is estimated at fifteen
                    hundred dollars and seven hundred and fifty dollars respectively, with an average of
                    $1,125 for both. Some Germans from the districts near the Rhine might be considered
                    rather wealthy as they brought with them in 1832 when they emigrated between three and four thousand
                    pounds. One hundred thousand Germans in 1843 had made arrangements to emigrate to the <placeName>

                    he might produce some food for his family. The Germans were, moreover, honest, patient, industrious,
                    persevering, and very thrifty, adding dollar to dollar, and within less than fifty years the German

            <p>The German preferred to settle in the forest because it served as a protection against storms, and
                    because of his economical habits he saw that the forest conferred benefits so far as the necessary
                    fuel, timber, bedding, and forage were concerned, and then too, he cherished them for sentimental
                    reasons. Ferdinand in <placeName>

                    felt at home there. The German pioneer brought his family to settle down in the heart of the
                    wilderness and remain, whereas some of the American pioneers brought their horse, ox, cow, dog, gun,
                    and family to remain only long enough to be able to sell his farm at a small profit. The Germans in

            <p>A considerable number of the Germans who emigrated to America the latter half of the nineteenth
                    century were farmers. They were attracted by cheap public and railroad lands, and later by free
                    homesteads; they became pioneer farmers. They brought with them less of the militant spirit and more
                    of the thrifty, balanced, agricultural life. It was their thrift, self-reliance, and intensive
                    agriculture that made them model farmers in America. Some of the American farmers did not have the
                    love for home, such as was to be found among the Germans, who took their families with them in
                    pursuit of simple pleasures. The former was always borrowing either money, tools, or provisions, but
                    the German farmer relied upon his own resources. When he erected a few buildings, some of his
                    American neighbors accused him of building a town. It is true that buildings for his livestock and
                    produce at times were far more pretentious than his humble dwelling. The day laborers and peasants
                    whose demands were simple and who were used to hard work, had no difficulty in adjusting themselves
                    to the conditions in the New World; the others, however, made no progress and in time many
                        succumbed.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>A number of German farmers in the West were "Latin farmers," who were more familiar
                    with Virgil than guiding a plow, and some Germans who worked on railroads and in shops knew Homer in
                    the original. These farmers encountered difficulties with the American plow which required the
                    lifting of the handles, whereas the German plow which rested on wheels was forced into the ground by
                    pressing on the handles. When the harvesting of the corn was undertaken, the hired man took his
                    knife used for pruning trees. This required constant bending of the back and was a slow process
                    since only enough stalks could be cut to set up two shocks before nightfall. One family who had two
                    swords which had been brought from <placeName>

                    pioneer farmers also brought hand sickles and scythes with which to harvest the small grain. Later,
                    they used the heavy wheat cradle, but this practically exhausted them. The threshing was done with
                    flails on an improvised floor, and later the grain was tramped out by horses. Of the "Latin

                    the plow and manure fork were stupid tools. It may be assumed that German farmers in other areas
                    encountered similar experiences.</p>
            <p>As a group, however, the Germans were considered successful farmers because they looked for good
                    land, and those who had money frequently displaced native-born settlers. Their methods played no
                    small part in their success. They were thorough and patient; the land was carefully cleared of
                    stumps and stones, and they endeavored to produce the largest possible yield per acre. Because
                    permanent possession was foremost in their mind, they believed in the rotation of crops, and were
                    careful not to exhaust the soil. They were economical. They saved on wood by using stoves instead of

                    cultivated, the enclosures better formed, prove clearly it is a German settlement. With them
                    everything announces ease, the fruit of their assiduity to labour."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>The German farmer's labor was more productive because he was assisted by his wife and
                    children. In his estimation a woman was also capable of working in the field, and hired labor should
                    be used only when the grain was to be harvested. Lalor makes the statement that the German never
                    sought in his wife an intellectual companion. If he was a philosopher, the less his wife knew of
                    syllogisms the happier he was. It may be assumed that because the German relied upon his family for
                    work in the fields, he did not approve of slavery, and in some states helped turn the tide of
                    sentiment in the direction of the cause of the Union.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

                    they frequently stipulated that the apprentice was to serve and obey his master until he had reached
                    the age of twenty-one. At times, the boy also contracted not to get married, nor to play cards,

                    measured from fifteen to twenty feet in diameter, and then cord wood was piled, on end, all over it;
                    openings for fires were left on each side of the large pile of wood, and the center was filled with
                    chips. The wood was banked in and the fire was started. For several days the pit required careful
                    watching. When the fire was about to break out, it was covered with earth and subdued. Sugar <list type="footnotes">

            <p>No matter how humble a German's occupation may have been, he tried to do his best. He knew

                    Edward Ross has pictured the German in a most fitting manner by these words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The German is lasting in his sympathies and his antipathies and leisurely in his mental
                            processes. It takes him long to make up his mind and longer to get an idea out of his head.
                            In his thinking he tries to grasp more things at a time than does the Celt. Not for him the
                            simple logic that proceeds from one to two outstanding factors in a situation and ignores
                            all the rest. He wants to be comprehensive and final where the Latin aims to be merely clear
                            and precise. It is this very complexity of thought that makes the German often silent, his
                            speech heavy or confused. But just this relish for details and this passion for thoroughness
                            make him a born investigator.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

            <p>Developments in music since nineteen hundred, which were based largely on the foundations previously
                    laid, involved notable and significant advances. The outstanding features of this period are the
                    establishment of the People's Concert Association and the People's Chorus, the
                    foundation of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch of the National Federation of Music Clubs, the expansion of the Matinee
                    Musicale, the rapid development of applied and theoretical music in the public schools, and the
                    founding of the Indiana State Symphony Orchestra.</p>
            <p>In the early years of the century a group of citizens headed by Edward B. Birge, Director of Music in
                    the Public Schools, conceiving the idea of offering good music, comparable to that of the May
                    festival days, on a non-profit system, and of making a bid for a larger audience, organized the
                    People's Concert Association. The sale of two or three thousand seats, at twenty five or
                    fifty cents each, would guarantee the engagement of fine artists, and at the same time afford
                    opportunity for the production of major com positions in which the local organizations would
                    participate. Mindful of financial hazards, the committee at first sought and obtained eighty
                    guarantors who promised to back the enterprise to the extent of ten dollars each, but as it turned
                    out, no guarantor was ever asked to pay. The creation of an audience—a very large
                    audience—was the crux of the problem, and it was solved iii a large measure by the fine
                    co-operation of the public school teaching staffs. Special publicity methods were indeed employed,
                    but when it became clear. that excellent programs could be heard for a sum within the reach of any
                    individual, even of whole families, the success of the undertaking was assured.</p>
            <p>The concerts were started with a relatively modest expense account on October, 30, 1905, with Karl
                    Schneider, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>During the years when the concerts were being given, Birge had organized a People's Chorus,
                    again drawing into the enterprise many members of the city school system, as well as the remnants of
                    the flagging choral unions of the earlier period. The first appearance of the People's
                    Chorus was on May 1, 1911, when they gave Mendelssohn's <hi rend="i">Hymn of Pmisc</hi>
                    under the baton of Birge. The success of the undertaking was complete, and rehearsals for a
                    Christmas rendition of <hi rend="i">The Messiah</hi> were immediately begun. The great oratorio was
                    given by the chorus and the <placeName>

                    and David Eaxter. This revival of Handel's work marked the first of a long series of
                    similar performances which ended only when Birge left the city in 1921, and since that time other
                    leaders have carried on the custom. <list type="footnotes">

                    Maennerchor. It was during Bellinger's directorship, (1897–1907), that the new
                    clubhouse was built and dedicated. Succeeding directors have been Rudolph Heyne, Karl Reckzeh, and
                    Clarence Ebert, who have maintained the noble traditions of the society.</p>

            <p>Beginning about 1910 the Musikverein specialized in opera which they gave with marked success.
                    Excerpts from <hi rend="i">Carmen, Faust, Surnson and Delilah</hi> were given in concert form, then

                    were performed complete in full costume. Latei. the orchestra was disbanded, owing to war
                    conditions. The Maennewchor, also faced with the difficulties of the times and obliged to abandon
                    its own clubhouse, then joined forces with the German House, whose name was changed to the

            <p>The Liederkranz, like the Maennerchor a German singing society, continued to carry on the tradition
                    of fine male chorus singing. Frederic Krull, at one time its director, was a prominent singer and
                    composer. he was born in the city, but received most of his musical training in Berlin, where his
                    uncle, Carl Voigt, was music director under. three emperors. Krull is riot only a singer of charm
                    aid distinction, but also a pianist, violinist, and composer. His best-known compositions are among
                    the thirty songs set to poems of James Whitcomb Riley. On many public occasions he has sung <hi rend="i">The Ruggedy Man, There Is Ever a Song Somewhere, an</hi>d other selections. Madame

                    Mrs. Jennie Suf-friens as organist. Membership grew to 185, spreading out from the choir loft into
                    the gallery. Following Wulschner, who died in 1900, Edward Taylor occupied the post of director for
                    seven years, then Hugh McGibney, who held the post for twenty years. The console was moved to the
                    front of the church in 1915, and chimes were added. Mrs. Jane Johnson Burroughs followed McGibney,
                    then came Dale Young, Lucille Pritchard, and Frank Watkins, the present leader.</p>

                    voice. Besides Newton, the singers are Bernard DeVore, Lila Sprunger, and Mrs. Elizabeth Ward
                    Crowell. Special evenings of music are given each month, and the singers, like those of many other

            <p>At the beginning of the century, public school music was in the hands of Helen Place and Leila Parr,
                    who emphasized the making of music rather than the cold study of scales. Place gathered the grades
                    together in weekly singing sessions—an innovation at that time. She also edited and
                    published one of the earliest journals devoted to her profession. This journal, <hi rend="i">School
                        Music</hi>, was later absorbed by one of the larger publications. It was important in that it
                    opened a new approach to the subject, stressing the principle that technique and the study of scales
                    are only temporary means to enjoyment of the art.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>Edward B. Birge was appointed Director of Music in 1901. Under his supervision the various systems of
                    teaching were harmonized, singing and playing were encouraged, and technical instruction inserted
                    whenever the children were ready for it. Both teachers and pupils responded to the treatment.
                    Already, in the late nineties, Charles Emmerich, Principal of the Manual Training High School, had
                    organized and conducted a school orchestra, and soon a similar group was established at Shortridge
                    High School. A concert was given by the combined orchestra and a chorus under Birge on May 29, 1903,

                    undertakings was so immediate and enthusiastic that Birge made the remark that he could at any time,
                    and without undue pressure, get a thousand children together and train them for a concert in six

            <p>As interest in performances rather than technique increased, the high schools began to include in the
                    curriculum class lessons in piano, violin, and band instruments, given by experienced teachers. In
                    an article which was widely read and reprinted in Europe Birge wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            precedent. The list of musical studies and activities in the curriculum of a high school of
                            the first rank reads very much like that of a high-grade conservatory of music. In the vocal
                            field these are mixed chorus, boy's and girl's glee-clubs and classes in
                            vocal technique: the instrumental field includes first and second orchestra and bands and
                            classes for instruction in all instruments, including the piano: in theory—there
                            are classes in harmony, counterpoint and composition, and the list includes also music
                            appreciation and history, with a strong swing toward making appreciation compulsory for all
                            students. The choruses practice and perform in public the standard oratorios, the glee clubs
                            sing part songs, cantates and light operas, and the orchestras play the symphonies of Haydn,
                            Mozart and Beethoven and many of the best overtures and suites, both classic and modern. The
                            bands are of symphonic fulness in instrumentation and perform the standard selections of
                            band literature. The ensembles include also string quartets and other chamber music

                    concert trio, and a girls’ ensemble of ten members. Paxton's Madrigal Singers
                    have given concerts throughout the state, twenty-five in the city, and have appeared on the programs
                    of the National Music Educators’ Association.</p>
            <p>With the higher standards of music instruction in the schools came the question of college entrance
                    credits for work done in music with satisfying answers from many of the colleges. The state
                    university gives partial credits in several branches, full credits in others, and many out-of-state
                    institutions are doing likewise. Following the tenure of Birge, which ended in 1921 when he was
                    called to Indiana University, Ernest G. Hesser filled the office until 1930, when Ralph W. Wright
                    was appointed Director of Music, which position he still holds. He has edited and arranged a book of
                    songs for boys’ use previous to voice mutation.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Thirty years ago the enrollment of music students in the city's conservatories was reckoned
                    at about twenty-five hundred and today is doubtless much larger. Many private teachers, as well as
                    those employed in the public school system, meet the needs of the budding musician. The College of
                    Musical Art was founded in 1907 by Oliver Willard Pierce offering excellent instruction in vocal and
                    instrumental music. This organization was merged with the <placeName>

            <p>The activities of the federation include the administration of scholarships for talented young
                    people, student loans, aid to high school bands and orchestras, the sponsoring of broadcasts and
                    musical films, civic concerts, and community singing. It assists in the support of the Symphony
                    Orchestra, gives aid to workers in civilian defense, provides special concerts for servicemen, and
                    sends musicians to perform at the hospitals. Some years ago the federation appropriated fifty
                    dollars for music scores to be rented at a nominal cost to the string quartets and orchestras of the
                    various high schools. This collection is now large and is in charge of the state librarian. The
                    Music-in-Industry section of the federation sponsors the formation of bands, orchestras and choruses
                    in industrial plants, and periodic concerts by visiting artists. Perhaps the most important of all
                    the federation enterprises is the aid it extends to American composers, thus assuring them publicity
                    and an audience in a highly competitive field. Auditions are held, with substantial prizes, in some
                    cases as much as a thousand dollars, for the winners in vocal or instrumental music, and for
                    original compositions. After the prizes have been won, the federation makes plans for the systematic
                    promotion of the prize-winning contestants, and for the performance of the successful scores.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    </placeName>, in the city where Stephen Foster was born, and the transfer was effected two years
                    later. The new Memorial is placed on ground given by the University, in the Cathedral of Learning
                    Quadrangle, facing Shenley Park. It was built by contributions from school children and friends from
                    all parts of the country, but especially sponsored by Mrs. Will Earhart and the Tuesday Musical Club
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Besides offering a site for the Memorial, the University maintains and operates the
                    building, which cost half a million dollars. It is built in Gothic style, of Indiana limestone, and
                    harmonizes with the loftier building of the Cathedral of Learning. The architect was Charles Z.
                    Klauder of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Memorial contains an auditorium for lectures and concerts, rooms for the Tuesday
                    Musical Club, offices for the Memorial staff, and the Shrine itself—a twelve-sided room
                    lighted by stained-glass windows depicting themes from the Foster melodies. In the Shrine are
                    displays of manuscripts, letters, personal belongings of Foster, a bibliography of the books,
                    magazine articles, and other printed material relating to his life. In the fireproof vault are the
                    irreplacable first editions and other memorabilia.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, more than fifteen thousand persons visited the Shrine, coming from all parts of the
                    country. Each week Foster programs were presented by a quartet, lectures and displays of material
                    were given. This procedure has in the main been followed in the new home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but on a larger scale. The Memorial has been from the beginning a non-profit
                    organization, and there is no charge either for observation or concerts. In the first year of
                    operation in <placeName>

                    the Shrine. The Memorial sponsors many publications of interest concerning Foster's life,
                    and research workers have examined and sometimes rejected many songs formerly attributed to him. The
                    number of original songs now accepted by the experts is 201. A specially interesting event was the

                    publishers of the city formed a Newsboys’ Band, with J. B. Vandaworker as leader, in
                    1900. Boys entered at the age of seven or eight, held practice in sections twice a week, and their
                    services were generally given free for charitable or educational entertainments. The newspaper
                    owners maintained the band and employed a professional director and manager. The <placeName>

            <p>As a culmination of the various musical developments, there came into existence a modern symphony
                    orchestra. Since an orchestra of this type is expensive and cannot be self-supporting, there must be
                    many guarantors and many contributors, as well as devoted workers, for its maintenance. Between
                    those early players and Fabien Sevitsky lies the record of many brave efforts and honorable
                    failures. As has been noted, larger or smaller instrumental groups were in existence all through the
                    intervening century, and at least two of the efforts attained a considerable measure of success.
                    Karl Schneider organized in 1904–1905 an orchestra of sixty pieces with occasional
                    special instruments brought in from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Schneider placed a symphony on every program and engaged celebrated artists. Elsa
                    Ruegger, Harold Bauer, Vladimir de Pachmann, and Sarah Layton Walker were among the soloists. He not
                    only maintained a high standard of performance, but he also paid his musicians. After two years
                    Schneider left the city, and the orchestra was taken over by Ferdinand Schaefer, a German musician,
                    who came to the city in 1907 and, like Schneider, was on the staff of the Metropolitan School of
                    Music. The strain of the upkeep was too great, however, and presently the players disbanded.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Early in 1911 another and more successful enterprise was launched through the influence of a group of
                    citizens. Herman Lieber and Leo Rappaport secured financial backing, and a committee of women took
                    up their duties as a Board of Directors.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> The organization was incorporated as

                    </placeName> Orchestra with Alexander Ernestinoff as director. There were about fifty pieces, and
                    the plan was to make it a co-operative society, the profits, if any, to be divided among the
                    players, and the price of seats to be kept low. Four concerts for each year were scheduled. The
                    program given at its second anniversary concert, February 9, 1913, well illustrated the quality of
                    music offered.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Through <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Other orchestras had a brief term of life, such as that started by P. Marinus Paulsen in 1921 with
                    one concert to its credit. The German House sustained its group of players under Ernestinoff for
                    upwards of a dozen years. In 1909 Victor Ila Clark announced the formation of a new orchestra, which
                    lived through one season. These trials form an interesting contrast to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Symphony Orchestra, which, with its all-women Board of Directors, held up for seven

                    musicians together and gave four concerts whose programs included the <hi rend="i">Scotch

                    </placeName>, and Ferdinand Schaefer was the conductor.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> The first concert
                    given under the auspices of the newly formed society was on October 24, 1931. Program notes were
                    made by Horace C. Gregory. On December 6, 1932, the Haydn bicentennial was celebrated, the orchestra
                    being supplemented by the Haydn Festival Chorus under the direction of Elmer Steffen.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

                    the office was filled by Jacob L. Mueller. The supporting members increased to eighty and special
                    donors gave added encouragement. William H. Hall took the president's chair in 1936 and
                    owing to the illness of Schaefer, the concerts were directed by the assistant, Robert Hager-Goetzel.
                    G.H.A. Clowes in 1941 assumed the presidency, which office he still holds. Two great conductors,
                    Vladimir Bakaleinikoff and Fabien Sevitzky, were invited to take the baton in 1936, and in the
                    following year Sevitzky was appointed conductor, with Schaefer as emeritus directing one concert
                    each year.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>Fabien Sevitzky was born in Russia, September 30, 1893, educated at Petrograd Conservatory, studying
                    piano with Alexander Siloti, the bass viol with Bech, and harmony with Liadoff. Upon his graduation
                    in 1911, he received the gold medal honors. He came to America in 1923 and was at one time a member

                    concerts, visits to Indiana and Purdue universities and to many Indiana cities, besides an
                    occasional flight outside the state. The personnel of the orchestra numbers well over a hundred. The

                    whole body has been brought into balance. Sevitzky has brought to it the best renditions of
                    performance, as well as astounding energy and patience. He has shown eagerness to present not only
                    the great musical literature of the past, but also to welcome productions of more recent writers
                    whenever worthy. He is perhaps better at interpreting Wagner and Shostakovich than in his readings
                    of Beethoven, but what director has not had his affinities? Besides the Beethoven, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>A full publishing program is planned by the Historical Society for 1946. Its latest <hi rend="i">Publication, Pioneer Sketches of the Upper Whitewater Valley</hi> by Bernhard Knollenberg,
                    appeared at the end of 1945 and was distributed in January. The next <hi rend="i">Publication</hi>
                    will appear in the fall. It will be the late George R. Wilson's report on the Buffalo
                    Trace, the historic trail from New <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the next number in the <hi rend="i">Prehistory Research Series</hi> will be issued this
                    spring. It will be a monograph by Vernon Kinietz, formerly of the University of <placeName>

                    sponsoring a memorial volume to Dr. Christopher B. Coleman, to consist of several of his addresses
                    on Indiana and the Old Northwest and on his philosophy of history. This volume will be distributed
                    to libraries within the state, but must be sold to individuals. Members will be given an opportunity
                    to subscribe to the volume at a later date.</p>
            <p>At the last executive committee meeting, it was voted to publish in pamphlet form a list of the
                    members of the Society, the constitution, and a list of the <hi rend="i">Publications</hi> before
                    the annual meeting in December. Meanwhile, every effort will be made to gain as many new members as
                    possible. In this effort, each member can assist by sending to the secretary's office the
                    names of prospects who might care to join.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Proceedings</hi> of the Indiana History Conference of last December were published
                    in the special January issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi> and distributed to
                    members. The library committee has prepared a special annual report of the William Henry Smith
                    Memorial Library which is being separately printed and will be sent to all members.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Charles C. Kryter, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has made a gift to the Society's library of 110 first editions of Indiana
                    authors and early histories from the private library of the late Mr. Kryter, an executive of the
                    Bobbs-Merrill Company and for many years a member of the Historical Society. A few titles were
                    duplicates of books already in the library, so Mrs. Kryter generously permitted the library to trade
                        <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-042-1-072"/> the duplicates for other titles which the Historical Society
                    would like to own. All of the books will carry the library's bookplate with a notice of the
                    donor's name.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, owned and excavated by the Historical Society since 1938, will be in the hands of the
                    Department of Conservation, to be administered as a state memorial for the educational benefit of
                    the people of Indiana. The Society retains the right to continue explorations in the area, but it is
                    expected that the Conservation Department will make some reconstructions of the old Indian village,
                    erect a museum, and provide guides to show the public through the site. This transfer was made as a
                    gift, after the! Society had saved the site for posterity by purchasing it.</p>

                    </placeName> Infantry Volunteer on August 5, 1862, by Governor Austin Blair. From October 24, 1862,
                    to September 9, 1863, he kept a journal. Nowhere in the journal is there a lengthy philosophical
                    discussion or political observation—Chaplain Cogshall was a busy man—but only
                    brief and hurried entries. Nevertheless, the journal is important for there is no regimental history
                    of the Nineteenth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and because of the proximity of the Nineteenth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> with the Thirty-third and Eighty-fifth Indiana. Cogshall seems to have adjusted himself
                    to the milieu of military life with great rapidity and to have concentrated his energies on
                    improving the spiritual welfare of the soldiers. If one reads his journal, there can be no doubting
                    but that he carried his spirit of evangelism with him into the war.</p>
            <p>The journal was written with pencil in two small leather-bound volumes. In addition to the narrative
                    journal there are many miscellaneous entries: notations of money loaned to the soldiers,
                    expenditures for mess, police details, laundry lists, and random thoughts. Only the chronological
                    account is here published. Cogshall gave little attention to the fine points of grammar. The editor
                    has not attempted to rectify this. But to facilitate reading, spaces have been left between words
                    where punctuation marks should have been placed.</p>

               <hi rend="i">David Ross</hi>—<hi rend="i">Modern Pioneer</hi>. By Fred C. Kelly.
                    (Alfred A. Knopf, <placeName>

            <p>David Ross, White County farm- and small-town boy early showed an interest in machinery. As a result
                    of temperament rather than poverty or environment, he spent a fairly lonely boyhood. Although needed
                    on the farm, he entered Purdue in 1889. During the next four years he lived out, participated in no
                    organized activities, belonged to no defined group; he was merely one of the large background group,
                    from which often come distinguished individuals in later life. Ross’ record in academic
                    work was not outstanding, but he had time to think and he did.</p>
            <p>He persuaded his father he could manage the latter's large farm better on his own sole
                    responsibility; showed the community how drainage made productive land out of wet lands; organized a
                    telephone company; made friends. Dave, who had been reading all about automobiles and taking long
                    walks to think about them, invented and patented his first of many ideas—an improved
                    steering gear. Believing he was getting into a rut on the farm, he cut loose, found backing for his
                    ideas, and became the mainspring in the Ross Gear and Tool Company. The man developed with, and
                    ahead of the automobile industry; in time came a fortune.</p>
            <p>From membership on an alumni fund-raising committee to trustee to President of the Board, Dave
                    progressed. A deal with George Ade pooled business sense with fame—result the Ross-Ade
                    Stadium, a field house, in time the Purdue Memorial Union. But these were not his main interests.
                    Land, buildings a University had to have, and Ross was looking fifty years ahead (he could buy as an
                    individual what the institution would need later) but a University is not buildings; it is men and
                    ideas. "I believe in seeking new knowledge." Ross’ money was important
                    but his ideas were more so. His greatest monument is not a stadium (in which he sometimes sat not
                    knowing which team won) but the Purdue Research Foundation, a dream dear to his heart, and his
                    influence in getting others to see that a university should hold to its major goals. In this, of
                    course, he had important help, but he had the interest, the money and the <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-042-1-093"/> time. When some were amazed at his liberal gifts, he laughed and said,
                    "Some men keep race horses or women. I'd rather help support a
                    university." From his bachelor home "The Hills" he continued active as
                    "Trustee Extraordinary" and "Citizen Consultant," inventing,
                    improving and inspiring to the end, which came in 1943.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kelly has written simply, effectively and in keeping with Dave Ross’ personality. The
                    author might have given more of the history of Ross’ business, but has chosen to
                    emphasize his public services. When Bruce Rogers "of Indiana" (Purdue
                    ‘90), A. Colish, The Plimpton Press, the Meriden Gravure Company and Mr. Alfred A. Knopf
                    all combine their talents to the making of a book, one expects it to be a nice-looking book, a nice
                    book to handle. It is. Purdue, Indiana and points beyond should feel pleased with the result.</p>

            <p>"I wrote this book because I was born and brought up in the Whitewater Valley and love it.
                    But I have a special reason for publishing it at this time. In 1908, Josiah Royce said in his <hi rend="i">Philosophy of Loyalty</hi>: ‘We need … in this country, a new and
                    wiser provincialism. … the sort of provincialism which makes people want to idealize
                    … their own province; to hold sacred its traditions, to honor its worthy
                    dead.’ ‘Further centralization of power in the national
                    government,’ he continues, ‘without a constantly enriched and diversified
                    provincial consciousness, can only increase the estrangement of our national spirit from its own
                    life.’ These words are even more apposite today."</p>
            <p>The author, who thus clearly stated his purpose, has carried out his intentions without falling into
                    the pitfalls which lay before him. The little volume which he produced is not strictly speaking a
                    history of the Whitewater Valley, although it is a historical account of many of the important early
                    developments.</p>
            <p>It begins with the forced withdrawal of the Indians and the arrival of the Friends in the upper

                    establishment of local government, are followed by an account of the organization of the Friends
                    Church and the Underground Railroad. In a chapter entitled "Henry Clay makes a
                    Speech," the author is less cautious and critical, and indeed seems to leave the impression
                    that it was this speech that defeated <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>. The Free Produce Movement, the Methodists, Joseph Tarkington, the National Road, the
                    Whitewater Canal, the coming of the Germans, Earlham College, the Gold Rush, and the arrival of the
                    Railroads are treated in successive chapters. The narrative stops at this point, but there is a
                    final chapter on a canoe trip down the Whitewater in 1940.</p>
            <p>Most of the chapters are written from a contemporary narrative or two, from which copious extracts
                    are quoted. The merits of the book include this revelation of the rich store of contemporary
                    materials and the thorough understanding which the author has of the valley. He has produced one of
                    those delightful little books which the reader wishes had been twice as long.</p>

            <p>Here in <hi rend="i">Mid Country</hi> are seventy-eight selections of "writings from the
                    heart of America." Although Mid Country is defined as "the land between the
                    mountains"—from the Appalachians to the Rockies, from the Lakes to the Gulf, the
                    great majority of the reprints presented deal with the great plains region. Many of them uphold the
                    idea contained in Glenway Wescott's definition of the region as "a certain
                    climate, a certain landscape; and beyond that, a state of mind of people born where they do not like
                    to live." Among the authors represented are such well-known names as J. Frank Dobie, James
                    Stevens, Marie Sandoz, Ruth Suckow, Walter Prescott Webb, and Jesse Stuart. Many of the pieces,
                    since they originally appeared in the regional and "little" <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-042-1-095"/> magazines, were missed by the general reader; this representative list
                    makes available some choice stories and essays. Likely as not several of the reader's
                    favorites will be the contributions of authors unknown to him. From the "Long-horn Blood
                    Call," "The Honey House," "They Set a Good Table,"
                    "The Snake Without a Friend" on through to "High Tension,"
                    "Stampede" and "They Shall Arise" the reader will pursue the
                    pieces with varying degrees of interest and appreciation, skipping few; those skipped he will
                    probably go back and read. The introduction by B. A. Botkin and the "notes on the
                    authors" give the setting and useful information.</p>
            <p>The anthology <hi rend="i">America is West</hi> deals with the Middle West, "the Heartland
                    of America," which has been somewhat arbitrarily defined by the editor as the twelve states
                    north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River and the southern boundaries of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. The introduction to the three-century-old literature of this region has been arranged
                    by the editor under eleven main groupings: Folklore and Legend, The Indian, Explorer and Traveler,
                    The Frontier, The Woods, The Farm, The River, The Small Town, The City, Middle-westerners, and
                    Interpretations. From Father Hennepin, Jonathan Carver and Alexander Henry to Carl Becker, Willa
                    Cather and Ruth Suckow, the reprints—mostly prose—have, in general, been made
                    from the works of authors whose life span coincided with the period written about.</p>
            <p>Naturally it is impossible to cover all important phases of the literature of the Middle West to say
                    nothing of its "life" in one volume. A work twice as large might have made
                    possible the inclusion of more material on the Indian, war, politics, pioneer life, education,
                    religion, health and medicine, amusements—all a part of life, if not of literature of the
                    Middle West. On these phases of life the reviewer misses particularly samples of stump oratory and
                    newspaper editorials, certainly among the most influential if not the most artistic of the
                    Midwesterner's literature. Nor is he reconciled to the editor's omission of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> as a part of the Middle West.</p>
            <p>As in <hi rend="i">Mid Country</hi>, the editor has used poetry sparingly. More of the selections are
                    from books, fewer are from contemporary magazine stories and articles. None knows the literature of
                    the Middle West better than Professor Flanagan <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-042-1-096"/>
                    —formerly of the University of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>
                    </placeName>, now of Southern Methodist—and on the whole he has selected wisely. The
                    reader of this "pageant of regional life" will mark some books and authors for
                    certain further exploration; many of the selections he will mark for rereading. Biographical
                    introductory sketches serve as valuable quick reference guides. For the reader acquainted with the
                    literature of the Middle West, this book is a pleasant and convenient volume; for the student or
                    reader just embarking upon its thrills, it is an indispensable asset.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">America is West</hi>, though a war-time publication, is well designed and attractively
                    printed. The reading public in general and Midwesterners in particular should commend the editor and

            <p>Karl Heinzen, who came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with many other "Forty-eighters," was born in Grevenbroich in the
                    district of Düsseldorf, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, February 22, 1809. This small town of the lower Rhine lay on the road traveled by
                    warring armies. When Heinzen was four years old, his mother died, and the next eight years were
                    spent with relatives. He was a problem child, and his record at the Gymnasium "was
                    essentially that of an unruly, prankish youngster who had brains enough but who would not submit to
                    discipline." Trouble seems to have been Heinzen's companion wherever he went.</p>
            <p>After the publication of his book on the Prussian administrative system, he left <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. "Prussia had become, in his mind, the symbol of feudal and medieval
                    obscurantism and absolutism, of intrigue, police, censorship, and broken promises." In
                    Brussels he met Ferdinand Freiligrath and Karl Marx. Later, he went to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName> and there continued his pamphleteering which led to difficulties and finally forced him
                    out of this country.</p>
            <p>Heinzen kept a diary of his trip to America which was <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-042-1-097"/> published
                    in 1859 and 1860 in a series of articles in the <hi rend="i">Pionier</hi> under the caption of
                    "Two Voyages to America."</p>
            <p>Although Heinzen edited a number of papers, his better-known and more successful one was <hi rend="i">Der Pionier</hi>. It did not afford him sufficient satisfaction to be known only as journalist;
                    he sought recognition as a poet, a playwright, and an author of books. He was "frank,
                    blunt, uncompromising, and impervious to popular reactions." "He wrote as though
                    he could command the world from his editor's desk. He never pricked with a needle when he
                    could hit over the head with a hammer." He never enlisted in the Civil War because he had
                    more confidence in the use of his pen than the sword.</p>
            <p>Heinzen did not approve of unrestricted immigration because he was of the opinion that most
                    immigrants came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> "not because of idealism but on account of empty stomachs." He
                    advocated a comprehensive examination in the geography, government, and history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and in the English language in place of the five-year residence requirement of
                    naturalization. He detested the German system of compulsory military training and attacked this
                    system in his "Thirty Articles of War for the New Day," and his <hi rend="i">German Soldiers’ Catechism</hi>, published on the eve of the Revolution of 1848. His
                    formula for world peace was to destroy all thrones and remove all monarchs.</p>
            <p>"Heinzen was an uncompromising, unbending, militant, radical republican, a crusader against
                    censorship, bureaucracy, militarism, and reaction in his native <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, a radical abolitionist, and a champion of equal rights for women and many other
                    political, economic, and social reforms in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    years."</p>
            <p>This is not only an interesting but a scholarly biography. The author has done an excellent piece of
                    work, particularly, in the manner in which he has treated historical events related to the life of
                    Heinzen.</p>

                    Lincoln students." So states the author in the first paragraph of his introduction. The
                    mature Lincoln follower will find nothing new between the covers of this publication; all the topics
                    here described have been treated before in innumerable reams of Lincolniana that preceded this
                    imprint. "Young people" who are inclined to read can spend a few profitable, and
                    even enjoyable, hours by a perusal of this work. People neither ancient nor juvenile will not find

                    Drink-water's "Abraham Lincoln" and went away an embryonic Lincoln
                    enthusiast and collector. This volume of essays marks him as a very definite Lincoln protagonist.</p>
            <p>The book contains five short essays: "Lincoln and His Books," "Lincoln and
                    the Women He Loved," "Lincoln and His Cabinet," "Lincoln and His
                    Generals," and "Lincoln and the Union." While none of the themes are
                    complete, the reviewer can say he enjoyed reading them. It is sometimes a relief to get away from
                    the ponderous, heavily-documented, and cumbersome Lincoln book and read one that is not at all
                    burdened with notes and references.</p>
            <p>The publishers are to be complimented on an excellent job of printing and binding. Not only have they
                    published the first Lincoln book of 1946 but also one that will surely "place" or
                    "show" in the field of attractive books for this year.</p>
