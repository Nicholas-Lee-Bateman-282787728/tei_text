            <p>A survey of the newspapers of the middle western states from their earliest beginnings would cover a
                    period of the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> dating back practically to the close of the American Revolution, and to a date
                    paralleling the beginning of the early form of American government in the Northwest Territory when
                    it was promulgated with the adoption of the Ordinance of 1787.</p>
            <p>To cover such a period would be to commence at a time when civilization's light was first
                    breaking through the rugged foothills of the Alleghenies or creeping over the mountainous passes of
                    the Blue Ridges of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the space of time allotted merely the faintest kind of a summary of the early history of
                    newspapers in this vast territory can be made. Cursory at best, yet intensely interesting, and
                    vitally connected with the development of the government of this "western
                    territory", the story of the founding of newspapers in these states and territories reads
                    like a novel of heroic characters, and brave men—the torch—bearers of the
                    gospel of liberty to light civilization's path over the prairies and in the fertile valleys
                    of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                    </placeName> rivers.</p>
            <p>The exigencies under which these early papers were established and nurtured bore out the fidelity to
                    purpose which these early pioneers had pledged themselves. The hazards of flat—boating
                    materials, together with the terrors of the trails <pb n="348" id="VAA4025-020-4-002"/> from
                    marauding Indians, was none the less as tedious as the actual establishing of these
                    newspapers—whether it was under an elm tree in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, over a public house when pigs interrupted the serenity of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> editor, in a log cabin as in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, or in hazardous fire traps of Hoosier clapboard sanctums.</p>
            <p>The Revolution had been successfully closed, George Rogers Clark a few years before had wrested this
                    vast territory of the Northwest from the British, George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was still president, the great <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> territory was still the property of the Louis’ and the rendezvous of the
                    Indian hordes, when John Bradford, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> planter, was "subsidized" to establish a newspaper in
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>— that portion of the Old Dominion, which was
                    anxious to become a state at the time of the adoption of the constitution.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the seat of government of the western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> country at that time was the center of the ambitious colonists who saw great political
                    advantage of having a mouthpiece to express their views on statehood. Consequently in July, 1786,
                    the town voted to give John Bradford, this <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> planter, a town lot if he would establish a newspaper. Bradford considered the offer
                    seriously and procured a press and outfit from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After a long and tedious flat—boat journey, the materials arrived and on
                    April 11, 1787, Bradford issued the first newspaper west of the Allegheny mountains.</p>
            <p>It was called the <hi rend="i">Kentucke Gazette</hi>, the word "Kentucke" carrying
                    the final "e", which was later changed to "y". The subscription
                    price of the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> was 18 shillings per annum, and "advertisements of
                    moderate length", 3 shillings.</p>
            <p>The first number was without a headline of any kind, and had only one advertisement, two short
                    original articles and the following apology by the editor: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>My customers will excuse this, my first publication, as I am much hurried to get an
                            impression by the time appointed. A great part of the types fell into pi in the carriage of
                            them from Limestone (Mays-ville) to this office and my pardner (his brother Fielder) which
                            is the only assistant I have, through an indisposition of the body has been incapable of
                            rendering the smallest assistance for ten days past.</p>

            <p>The trip from Limestone to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was across swollen streams, over fallen trees and through the sniping crack of Indian
                    rifles, for the trail between the two towns had been blazed with human blood.</p>
            <p>The first issues show that Bradford had to carve his capital letters and rude cuts and ornaments out
                    of dog wood. Many editions of the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> during that early period were printed on
                    paper manufactured in <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, caused the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> to be looked forward to as climaxing the efforts
                    of these back-woodsmen to crystallize the sentiment therefor, and post riders arriving in the
                    hamlets and villages would be a signal for the whole population to turn out while school-master or
                    squire would ceremoniously mount a stump to read the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> aloud.</p>
            <p>An editorial desk made of a smooth slab supported by a pair of crossed legs, a three legged stool, an
                    ink horn and a rifle composed the furniture of Editor Bradford's first sanctum.</p>
            <p>The Bradford family was connected with the establishment of the first three newspapers in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and it is also interesting to know that printers who gained their inspiration in the
                    profession in Bradford shops, established the first newspapers in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>

            <p>The civilization of the colonies which crept across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> mountains was scarcely ahead of the civilization which filtered across the Alleghenies
                    to the north, and attracted the adventuresome to go to the vast <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> territory.</p>
            <p>With the establishment of the government of the Northwest territory at Marietta, 0., William Maxwell,
                    the second postmaster of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, conceived the idea of establishing a newspaper. This he did and on November 9, 1793,
                        <hi rend="i">The Centinel of the Northwest Territory</hi> appeared, pledged as it was as
                    "Open to all Parties—Influenced by None."</p>
            <p>In 1796 Edward Freeman purchased this paper and changed the name to <hi rend="i">Freeman's
                        Journal</hi>, and in 1800 he moved the plant to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. Nathaniel
                    Willis is supposed to have started the Scioto Gazette in 1796, but it is known that in 1800 he
                    purchased the <hi rend="i">Freeman's Journal</hi> and if there <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-020-4-004"/> were two papers existant at that time, the name Scioto Gazette was
                    given to the consolidated papers. The Scioto Gazette is still in existence and carries its
                    foundation date as April 25, 1800–the oldest newspaper west of the Alleghenies in point
                    of continuous publication.</p>

            <p>Indiana was the third territory, the early civilization of which demanded the establishment of a
                    newspaper. Elihu Stout, a young <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> friend of Patrick Henry, gained the incentive to start his newspaper at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> while working in the office of the Bradfords at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the territorial capital of Indiana and a rival of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in importance as a center of the social, legislative and judicial intelligence in the
                    wilderness.</p>
            <p>With the material assistance of the Bradfords, Stout bought three horses at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>, and procured a printing press and the necessary utensils and with
                    his three horses packed his valuable outfit to the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and back up the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His supply of paper he carried on horseback overland.</p>
            <p>The first issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi> appeared July 31, 1804. Stout continued the
                    Gazette until the spring of 1806 when fire destroyed his plant and he had to go back to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> for another outfit. Undaunted he came back and on July 4, 1807, resumed the publication
                    of his paper, this time calling it The <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi> which name continues on the
                    weekly publication of the <hi rend="i">Sun</hi>—the second paper west of the Alleghenies

            <p>As civilization forged its way westward, the water routes furnished the easiest access to the

            <p>Goodhue wielded a vitriolic pen, which led him into personal encounters, and in the last one he was
                    attacked by a Judge Cooper of whom he had written: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </placeName> now is established. This paper was printed September 15, 1854. There was not a <pb n="355" id="VAA4025-020-4-009"/> house to be seen at that time, nor any definite sign of
                    civilization, and its editor challenged the pioneering instinct and proposed to lead instead of
                    follow and to blaze the trail in the Sunflower state. It was called The <placeName>

                    </placeName> Weekly Herald and lasted for five years. A second paper was founded at Kickapoo and
                    early in 1856 two others started in Lawrence. Founding of newspapers became infectious in <placeName>

                    </placeName> especially after <placeName>

                    </placeName> politics began to boil, and the newspaper was the chief outlet of its political
                    partisanship.</p>
            <p>As the dawn of civilization's sun kept moving its horizon westward, it crept next into South
                    Dakota, where the sturdy pioneers into these vast areas demanded a newspaper. The first one to
                    appear was at Sioux Falls July 2, 1859. This paper was destroyed in the Indian uprising of 1862.
                    Samuel J. Allbright was its founder, and he named his paper <hi rend="i">The Dakota Democrat.</hi>
                    <hi rend="i">The Dakotan</hi> established at Yankton June 6, 1861, was South Dakota's
                    second newspaper. It still thrives.</p>
            <p>Not until July 6, 1873, however, did <placeName>
                        <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>
                    </placeName> boast of its first newspaper. Col. Clement A. Lounsberry established the <hi rend="i">Bismarck Tribune</hi> on that date. He was a <placeName>

                    came through to Bismarck over the Northern Pacific railroad. The <hi rend="i">Fargo Express</hi> was
                    the second <placeName>
                        <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>

            <p>Having reviewed the beginnings of the first newspapers in the middle western states, the paramount
                    interest in this resume is to examine the conditions under which the very oldest papers of this
                    section were published.</p>
            <p>The papers were usually of four pages, with three or four columns to the paper. <hi rend="i">The <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                        </placeName> Gazette</hi> started about the size of a half sheet of letter paper. The <hi rend="i">Centinel of the Northwest</hi>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s first paper, was three columns, and the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi>
                    was a four column folio. The type was usually of 12-point size, and the column widths varied,
                    usually 15 to 16 ems wide. Headlines were wanting, advertising displays void, and the editors had
                    little or no use with any column rule pieces except the full lengths.</p>
            <pb n="356" id="VAA4025-020-4-010"/>
            <p>The papers were printed on the old hand-presses, on paper full rag and of durable quality.
                    Hand-rollers were used to distribute the ink, and the finished paper was no more than a proof sheet
                    of the hand-set forms.</p>
            <p>It was necessary to make a salutatory to the generous public by these early pioneer editors, and
                    Editor Maxwell of the <hi rend="i">Centinel of the Northwest Territory</hi> said in part: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            disposed to promote science and have the fullest assurance that the Press from its known

            <p>Editor Stout, whose debut in the Hoosier wilderness was made to a circulation of readers consisting
                    mostly of creole French, Indians, a few pure English stock and a straggling number of old Dominion

                        <p>At length after great trouble and much expense the Public is presented with the first number
                            of the Indiana. Without deviation from the general rule of News-Paper Printers in the first
                            number the Editor addresses the Public, and lays down the principles which shall govern the
                            publication. His object shall be to collect and publish such information as will give a
                            correct account of the productions and natural advantages of the Territory, to give the
                            latest foreign and domestic intelligence—original essays, political, Moral,
                            Literary, Agricultural, and on Domestic Economics. To select such fugitive literary
                            productions as will tend to raise "the genius or mend the heart," etc.,
                            will be the second.</p>
                        <p>The political complection of the paper shall be truly republican; but it never shall be
                            prostituted to party. Essays of any political complection couched in decent language shall
                            find a ready insertion—but the Editor pledges himself that the columns of the
                            Gazette, shall never be tarnished with matter that can offend the eye of decency, or raise a
                            blush upon the cheek of modesty and virtue.</p>

                        <p>With this outline the Indiana Gazette is submitted for patronage, to a generous and
                            enlightened public—and the Editor feels confident of encouragement, equal to his
                            merit—and though it is not always in our power to command success, yet he will
                            ever "endeavor to deserve it."</p>

            <p>The policy of the paper announced, the circulation rates always occupied a conspicuous place. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Gazette charged 18 shillings a year, or possibly $2.25. The <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi> was $2.00 a year if paid in advance but in the event of a
                    delinquency, 50 cents additional was charged.</p>
            <p>No postal zone laws were sources of worry or letters to the editor's congressional friends,
                    as the printers explicitly stipulated in most cases, that "wherever papers are sent by
                    post, the person subscribing must pay the postage." Uncle Sam was running a c. o. d. system
                    then.</p>
            <p>The early papers of the territories were the official papers of their realms—this being
                    the chief source of revenue. The territorial government and the federal government published the
                    laws in the designated official papers and paid space rates for this service. This was the only
                    means of disseminating the laws to the people of the Northwest territory.</p>
            <p>Concerning the advertising and general content of the early newspaper permit me to refer more
                    specifically to research into the files of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi> as an example of
                    the general trend of business and the literary achievements of the early mid-west newspaper.</p>
            <p>The newspaper, however primitive, had to depend on advertising and though we shudder to think of the
                    contracts which the advertising managers, verily the editor himself, could swing with his mercantile
                    clientele of the early days, yet we find that the advertising rates were published each day. There
                    were no sliding scales, no cost plus rates, no display, reader, classified, foreign or domestic
                    rates but the simple: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Advertisements of no more length than breadth inserted three times for one dollar and fifty
                            cents and twenty five cents for each continuance.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The theory of the income increment evidently justified the fourth insertion of advertisements,
                    perhaps not scientifically correct in the cost sheets of today.</p>
            <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-020-4-012"/>
            <p>Nor was circulation of the early newspapers overlooked. No circulation sharks offered insurance
                    policies, cook books, coaster wagons or kitchen utensils as premiums in those days. There were no
                    inducements, save possibly the concessions, save the economic necessity of some editors to accept
                    merchandise in lieu of cash, and the threat of demanding cash when the editor's larder was
                    low.</p>
            <p>Friends were depended upon for the circulation of the papers. In one of the early files of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi> this request is found: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The respective persons in whose hands subscription paper have been placed for the purpose of
                            procuring subscriptions for the Indiana Gazette will be pleased to forward them to the
                            editor as soon as possible.</p>

            </p>
            <p>No A B C statements were required by any of the advertisers of that day, nor was there any squabble
                    over what constituted a legitimate subscriber.</p>
            <p>The movement of the mails in those early days did not require aeroplanes but as the arteries of mail
                    movements were either over wilderness trails or on the flatboats which plied the streams, the
                    editors were often annoyed by their inefficient schedules.</p>
            <p>Imagine an irate sub walking into the office of an early Indiana newspaper down on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river, shaking his cane at the editor and demanding why the paper did not have any more
                    news in it and threatening not to pay for it, nor bring in any more tallow or tobacco, and to have
                    it stopped immediately. To avoid such scenes the editor of this newspaper used discretion by the
                    following apology: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The great dearth of news in this day's paper, is owing to the entire failure of the
                            eastern mail, which was due last Friday. We have received no papers by any mail since last
                            Tuesday week. The waters we believe have not been so high but the eastern mail might have
                            been received if proper exertions had been made by the contractor or carrier. Travelers we
                            are informed crossed them at the time the mail should have done so, which we think will
                            leave the carrier without excuse and he ought in our opinion to suffer the penalty incident
                            to negligence.</p>
                        <p>It is of great importance to the public that the mails should be transported regularly; yet
                            we find that failures are common, and that carriers most generally, we believe, get a
                            certificate from some P. M. on the route, which clears them of a fine. If postmasters would
                            not <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-020-4-013"/> give certificates unless they were confident that
                            there was evident danger of losing the mail, there would be fewer failures and the public
                            would be better accommodated for their money.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the circulation department of the paper was rescued from a week of panic and explanations.</p>
            <p>The news departments of these early papers depended largely on the contributors. Aside from the
                    publication of the laws, the exchanges were freely overworked. Local news did not gain much
                    attention. An occasional marriage was recorded, a fire was given a line or two, but for the most
                    part the columns were devoted to what happened down East, or Napoleon's conquests in
                    Europe.</p>
            <p>However, with all the sparseness of local news, nevertheless the contemporaneous history of much of
                    the territory is gleaned from the files of the newspapers of the early days, and the most profound
                    care is taken of these early files in the state archives and repositories today.</p>

            <p>An incident of passing interest regarding the <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi>, the successor to the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi>, was revived by the <hi rend="i">National Republican</hi> several
                    years ago. In the Lincoln issue of 1921, Albert Reid, had a front page cartoon of Abraham Lincoln
                    standing in front of a <placeName>

            <p>Lincoln, traveling from his old home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> county, Indiana, passed through <placeName>

               </placeName>, in March of 1830. According to
                    the story connected with this incident Lincoln, then a youth of 21 years, spent the greater part of
                    his three days in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                        Republican</hi> printed <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-020-4-014"/> the story and gave the title to the
                    cartoon: "First Meeting of the Nineteenth Century's Two Great
                    Emancipators."</p>
            <p>The fiery pens of these early editors were but as exam- ples of the intense partisanship in the
                    political discussions of the early territorial periods of these mid-western states. One example of
                    this is shown from the files of the Indiana Gazette of August 27, 1804. William McIntosh, a friend
                    of Aaron Burr's, took an exception to the official conduct of Benjamin Parke, the first
                    judge of Indiana territory. Parlre resented the insinuations of McIntosh and made the following pro-
                    nouncement in the Gazette concerning McIntosh: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Circumstances have recently occurred which authorize me in pronouncing and publishing William

            <p>It is more of passing interest in closing to note the humor cf these early newspapers. There was
                    lacking to be sure, the paragraphs columns, the comic strips or the colored sections, but a distinct
                    portion of the paper was usually set aside for humor and literary effort. It was usually called the
                    "Poetic Asylum" or some equally as high-sounding name. It contained extracts from
                    Goldsmith, a poem by Sir Walter Scott, an essay by Sam Johnson and then, too, some good wholesome
                    humor.</p>
            <p>The subject of the humor of that day was not unlike the hackneyed subjects of today-the Irishman, the

                        <p>An old gentleman of venerable appearance passed through this country a few days since, and
                            gave a number of our citizenship the following information:</p>
                        <p>That he was from the neighborhood of the Cayuga Lake, just as he started on his journey, he
                            saw a man, who informed him two men were fishing in the lake, when they beheld at a little
                            distance a monster in the shape of a snake rise out of the lake and stretch himself on the
                            bosom of the water. That his appearance was</p>
                        <p>"Fierce as ten furies, Terrible as hell."</p>
                        <p>That the fishermen with more than ordinary courage ventured near enough to reach him with a
                            rifle ball, and both firing at once fortunately dispatched him. On measurement he was found
                            to be 103 feet 4½ inches in length and his size was proportionately as great.
                            From his head projected a horn of considerable size.</p>

                            </placeName> some 18 or 20 years ago, an uncouth fellow of the age of 18, was introduced in
                            the court as a witness for the plaintiff. The defendant arose and objected to his being
                            admitted as a witness, "For," said he, "he does not know enough
                            to understand the nature of an oath. Therefore he ought not be allowed his evidence in this
                            court, and to convince you, gentlemen, that this is the case, I will ask him a few
                            questions. He then turned to the young fellow and said: To which the fellow replied:
                            "I don't know, I 'twas Moses." "His answer,
                            gentlemen, I think is sufficient to convince you that what I have said respecting him is
                            true, without any further evidence." And he sat down. The young fellow by this time
                            began scratching his head, and feeling somewhat chagrined that he should be thus taken off,
                            and begged leave of the court to ask the gentleman, who had just interrogated him a few
                            questions. "Who made you, sir?" To carry on the joke a little farther upon
                            his awkward lad, he replied : "Don't know, 'spose 'twa
                            Aaron." "Well," said the fellow, "We read in the good
                            book, that Aaron made a calf, but I didn't know how the darned fool got
                            here." "Who made you?"</p>

            <p>The wheat harvest for the present season being now nearly ready for the sickle, and the wet weather
                    we were having the past week reminds the writer that many years ago if such wet weather had set in,
                    many farmers would have predicted that the wheat would be "sick", that is, that
                    the flour made from such wheat when made into bread and eaten would have produced nausea and
                    vomiting. For well does he remember when he has eaten a meal, and eaten new wheat bread, how deathly
                    sick it has caused him to be. But it has been many years since there has been any
                    "sick" wheat in this country. What caused the "sick" wheat was
                    always a debatable question, nearly every one having his own theory to advance. Some seasons the
                    wheat crop would be very much damaged during such wet weather as we have had for the past week, by
                    the wheat sprouting after being cut and shocked, and often to sprout before being cut.</p>

                    performed by persons from this place to different points in the state years gone by. In 1817 or 1818
                    the trip from Vevay to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> was performed on horseback in the spring of the year in about six days, through mud,
                    rain and across swollen water courses. In many cases having to cross a stream through the water for
                    the distance perhaps of some two, three and oftentimes four miles.</p>
            <p>As late as the fall of 1832 the writer, in company with others, was over three days in reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>

            <p>Of steamboat traveling much could be said that would be both amusing and instructive. Some of the
                    first steamboats <pb n="365" id="VAA4025-020-4-019"/> running on the <placeName>

                    the names of many of them are entirely forgotten. The "Velocipede," "Gen.
                    Green", "Plough Boy", "Highland Laddie" and
                    "Eliza" are the names of some of the early steamboats recollected on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river. At one time the "Velocipede" was caught in a storm not far
                    from this place and had her upper deck damaged considerably. The "Gen. Green" at
                    one time struck a snag, sinking and damaging the cargo, which was principally coffee. The
                    "Plough Boy" was at one time running up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

            <p>But steamboat traveling in those days was as expeditious in proportion as the travel by land, the

            <p>It would appear from the frequent and open violation of law in our midst that the population has in
                    no wise improved in morality since the early days of the county, although they have the opportunity
                    of hearing the Gospel preached much more frequently than then. For from about the year 1814 until
                    about 1827 there was perhaps no regularly organized church in Vevay or its immediate vicinity on the
                    Indiana side of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river. But there was frequent preaching by the Baptist and Methodist ministers or local
                    preachers up to 1818 or 1819, when Dr. Jas. Welsh, the Presbyterian minister mentioned in a former
                    number, began preaching weekly of Sabbaths in the courthouse, and although there was no regularly
                    organized Presbyterian church he continued to preach until his suspension from the ministry by the
                    Presbytery of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> about the year 1825.</p>
            <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-020-4-020"/>
            <p>In 1824 a Presbytery was formed in Indiana, comprising seven ministers, thirty-one organized churches
                    and a missionary society, and embraced the whole of the state west of a line drawn due north from
                    the mouth of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> river.</p>
            <p>On the 28th of January, 1828, a meeting of those persons friendly to the Presbyterian church was held
                    in Vevay for the purpose of electing ruling elders of the church to be formed in this place. Rev.
                    Ludwell G. Gaines acted as moderator, by order of the presbytery of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Edward Patton was clerk of that meeting. <placeName>

                    </placeName> R. Whitehead and James G. French were chosen to receive and count the votes. Three
                    elders, William French, Morgan Patton and David Walker, formerly a ruling elder in the church of Log
                    Lick, were elected.</p>
            <p>David Walker, it may not be improper here to state, was the father of Judge Charles E. Walker, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The church thus organized during the winter and spring of 1828 raised by voluntary subscription about
                    $270 in sums from $1 to $30 and bought a lot on which the present
                    Presbyterian church stands, and during the summer and fall of that year had erected a church, built
                    of brick, but so badly put up that it did not last very long. In that building the church worshipped
                    until about 1838, when the church became nearly extinct. During this period of time the church
                    enjoyed the ministerial services of Rev. L. G. Gaines, Joshua L. Wilson, R. B. Dobbins, J. Thompson,
                    — Thomas, Peter Munfort, John Morral, William Lewis, H. Little, William J. Montieth,

                    who was so long connected with the Methodist church, is known to have preached a funeral sermon in
                    Vevay sometime in the year 1816, and Abner Clarkson, who was residing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1813, says he heard Mr. Wiley preach in <placeName>

            <p>There was no regularly organized Methodist church in Vevay until about the year 1825. In 1837 the
                    Methodist congregation built a brick church on the lot where the present Ruter Chapel stands,
                    previous to which their meetings were held in the courthouse, schoolhouse, and in the old
                    Presbyterian church. The writer has forgotten the names of most of the Methodist ministers who
                    preached in this place, but recollects the names of Revs. Mr. Strange, Enoch G. Wood, Tarkington,
                    James Jones, H. J. Durbin and Allen Wiley, who were at different times on Vevay circuit as circuit
                    preachers or presiding elders.</p>
            <p>The Baptists held their meetings for many years in the schoolhouses of the town, but more frequently
                    in a log house which stood on Market street about where Ulysses P. Schenck's ice house now
                    stands. Among the earlier preachers of that persuasion who preached in that house may be named
                    Mordecai Jackson, father of Ibzan Jackson, of Posey township; John Graham, who resided for many
                    years on the left hand fork of Indian creek, H. D. Banta, and occasionally Mr. Clark, the father of
                    Lewis A. Clerk, preached in town. And although Mr. Clark was blind, and had been from his youth, if
                    he once had an introduction to a person, and conversed with him for a short time, if he should meet
                    that person long after, upon hearing his voice he would recognize him and call him by name. Mr.
                    Clark had a son (<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange</region>
                    </placeName> Clark) living in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> whom he visited sometimes, traveling all the way by land with a small boy as his guide.
                    When passing through Vevay on one of his journeys to his son's, when asked whither he was
                    traveling, his reply was "to see my son in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>The Baptist congregation in 1834 contemplated building a meeting house, and in soliciting
                    subscriptoins among the citizens to defray the expense, and to obtain a lot on which to build it,
                    John F. Dufour executed to Henry D. Banta, William Price and Mordecai McKenzie, trustees of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> Baptist church, a bond for a deed to the south-east half of lot No. 71, provided a
                    brick meeting-house were built on the same within 18 months, not less than 30 feet wide by 40 feet
                    long, and 13 feet high between the floor and ceiling. The house was built and completed and is the
                    one now used by <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-020-4-022"/> them. Some two years after, the trustees
                    represented to John F. Dufour that they had lost the bond, but wished him to make the deed, which he
                    did, but as the trustees were anti-missionary, they insisted on having the deed made to the
                    "Regular anti-missionary Baptist Church." This will account for the manner in
                    which the deed was thus made. It may not be amiss to state that the Baptist church in this place was
                    first organized in 1833.</p>
            <p>The engine mentioned in a former number, set up by Joshua Smithson as the first engine ever set up in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was built by Frederick L. Grisard, who was carrying on the blacksmith business, and
                    Lewis Golay, who had served an apprenticeship at engine building with a person by the name of Tift.
                    All the wrought iron work about it was worked by F. L. Grisard, and the polishing and finishing was
                    done by Lewis Golay, and the engine set up and put in running order by him.</p>
            <p>In speaking of preaching in this vicinity in early times, I neglected to mention a custom that
                    existed among the Swiss colonists from their first settlement here until some later period, when
                    preaching became more frequent. It was their custom to meet together on the Sabbath for religious
                    services, such as singing psalms, reading prayers and some one of the number reading a sermon, at
                    which services the whole number of colonists would be present. The reading of the prayers and the
                    sermon was most frequently done by Daniel Dufour who was the oldest of the male colonists. Some of
                    the services were very impressive as the the sermons read were those which had been delivered in the
                    "Fatherland" by some of most eminent ministers of that period, belonging to the
                    Protestant church, and perhaps their delivery had been heard there by some of the eldest persons
                    present who heard the reading here, which must no doubt have recalled to their minds recollections
                    of their former homes, the friends and companions of their youth, far away from the macross the
                    broad Atlantic.</p>
            <p>About the earliest revivals of religion in this neighborhood commenced among the Baptists in Craig
                    township, under the preaching of Rev. Henry D. Banta and John Graham. They <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-020-4-023"/> preached in several different neighborhoods. They preached frequently
                    at the house of Mr. Thiebaud, being on the same farm where Justin Thiebaud now resides; and those
                    persons who were received as members were as a matter of course baptized in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river. In this connection, an anecdote may be very appropriately related which will go
                    in some measure to show the depravity of the human heart when not under the influence of the Gospel,
                    which proclaims "On earth peace, good will to man." On one occasion there were
                    several persons who were about to receive the ordinance of baptism, and the officiating minister was
                    wading out to ascertain the condition of the bottom. It is said a person standing near by seized a
                    good sized dog by the neck and threw it into the water near the minister, exclaiming:
                    "There is one baptized."</p>
            <p>An anecdote that is related by some, that on one occasion Daniel Dufour had on the Sabbath, read a
                    very impressive and affecting sermon, which it is said brought tears into the eyes of many of his
                    hearers. In speaking of the reading of the sermon he remarked to some person who asked him if he had
                    preached, that he had, and that his hearers shed tears on hearing him. Some one remarked that it
                    must have been a very affecting sermon. He replied, yes, for he had shed tears also and "I
                    be damned if you had heard it you would have cried, too."</p>
            <p>There has never been any very extensive revival of religion in any one of the religious denominations

                    </placeName>, except in the Methodist church, about the year 1840, when upwards of 150 were received
                    into the church on probation; but on many occasions there has been very marked interest manifested
                    by numbers who attended public worship in the several churches in the town, and they have slowly and
                    gradually increased in numbers.</p>
            <p>Many years ago, and while James Kirby, the father-in-law of George E. Pleasants, resided here, a
                    Universalist preacher came here, and it was announced that he would preach in the
                    "Barracks", a long frame building which stood on the corner of Market and Union
                    streets, on the lot now owned and occupied by John Melcher, which had received that name as by
                    common consent. Mr. Kirby called on Abner <pb n="370" id="VAA4025-020-4-024"/> Clarkson and wished
                    him to go and hear the true doctrine, and after much persuasion Mr. Clarkson consented to accompany
                    him. After hearing the preaching of the sermon, and on the way home Mr. Kirby remarked to Mr.
                    Clarkson "that's the doctrine," and appeared to be very much interested
                    in the "doctrine." The next day, after having slept over and thought of the
                    sermon, he met Mr. Clarkson and said to him, "Well, Clarkson, I believe the doctrine we
                    heard preached last night will do very well to live by, but will not do to die by."</p>
            <p>This Mr. Kirby, it was now recollected, was the owner of a steamboat in early days, perhaps about
                    1817, which was called "Vesta," and which was used in navigating the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> rivers. It is related that on one dark night, when ascending the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> near to or above Big Bone creek, Mr. Kirby, who was acting as captain, perceived
                    something in the river near to the "Vesta" when he called out "Show your
                    lights!" And receiving no answer, and no light being shown, he directed the pilot to go
                    ahead, when suddenly the "Vesta" came up against a large rock, and the consequence
                    was the sinking of the "Vesta." That rock was for many years afterwards called
                    "Kirby's Rock". Whether that rock retains that name among steamboat men
                    of the present day, is not known to the writer.</p>
            <p>While on this subject it may not be improper to state that before the introduction of steamboats on
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> river and their tributaries, the trading on the river was carried on with flatboats,
                    keelboats and barges. Keelboats and barges were used for bringing groceries and other heavy articles
                    up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> rivers and their tributaries, and were propelled against the current with poles, and by
                    "cordeling".</p>
            <p>In this business James Kirby was engaged for some years, with one or two barges, one of which it is
                    believed he converted into a steamboat, by having an engine put up.</p>
            <p>Joseph Bosaw is about the only person now living in our midst who was engaged in the keelboat
                    business, he having perhaps made one or two trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and back, and <pb n="371" id="VAA4025-020-4-025"/> several trips up to Kanawha Salines
                    with a loan, and returning laden with salt.</p>
            <p>About the year 1815, a person named Jackson made a trip from some place in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, perhaps Steubenville, down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river with a keelboat laden with furniture and such other manufacturers of wood as was
                    much needed in this new country, stopping at Vevay for a few days. This Mr. Jackson made several
                    trips down the river with his keelboat laden each time with furniture. There is still in Vevay a set
                    of chairs purchased of Mr. Jackson about 1816, and any person having the curiosity of seeing a set
                    of chairs, which in those pioneer times were considered the best that could be made, may do so by
                    calling in at Mrs. Polly Dufour's on Liberty street.</p>
            <p>As these articles may now begin to be uninteresting to the readers of the Democrat, the writer will
                    begin to give something of more recent times, and will try and get up a few numbers, relating
                    incidents from about 1823 and a few years later.</p>
            <p>Anything that may have been related of individuals, has not been so related with any other view than
                    to give a history of the times, so far as the writer knows, and has been informed by others, without
                    the least intention of doing an injury to the feelings of any.</p>
            <p>Sometime in 1818, William C. Keen, who was brigadier general of Indiana militia, and resided in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, received two six-pounder iron guns from the state authorities, being the quota of that
                    grade of arms to be distributed in his brigade. One of those guns was sent to Rising Sun, where an
                    artillery company had been organized. The other was retained at this place, and a company was
                    organized, and Daniel V. Dufour was elected captain of that company. There was no person at the time
                    who knew much or anything of artillery practice, except the captain, he having attended a military
                    school in his native country. The company was organized and were regularly drilled, so that in a
                    short time it was what might be termed a No. 1 company, so far as manoeuvering with the guns was
                    concerned. The company was, after it had been organized three or four years, composed of young men
                    from <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, and sons of the Swiss about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a few <pb n="372" id="VAA4025-020-4-026"/> Americans. The names of some of them as
                    far as can be ascertained were: Captain Daniel V. Dufour, privates S. C. Jones, W. H. Jones, Chas.
                    Thiebaud, A. Raymond, R. Morerod, F. Morerod, J. Detraz, B. Detraz, G. Kessler, F. Desserens, J.
                    Vairin, A. Bornaud, P. Bettens, B. F. Siebenthal, Fred L. Grisard. After the first organization of
                    the company, many others became members, but none appear to have been near as expert gunners as some
                    of the old members, who were drilled and exercised in the management of the gun occasionally on
                    Sunday afternoons.</p>
            <p>In 1825, when it was known that General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> would certainly visit <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the company determined to visit that city at that time, and take with them their gun,
                    which, in after years received the name of "Old Betz." Some members of the company
                    were prevented from going to see the general, but a number of them embarked on a steamboat and
                    reached the city about an hour after the general and escort had crossed from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and were not present at the reception, but they had a fine time of it generally.</p>
            <p>Some members of the company who remained at home, predicted that on their arrival at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, those who did go would not be noticed by any persons among the thousands who would be
                    present to welcome the nation's guest.</p>
            <p>The company, on their arrival, were met at the landing by members of the committee on arrangements,
                    and of the artillery company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and when "Old Betz" was rolled off the boat on to the beach, and the
                    boys were ready to haul her up the bank by hand one of the officers of the day came riding up and
                    told them that in a short time a span of horses would be sent to take the piece up into the city and
                    enter the procession that was about being formed. In a short time a span of fine blacks was hitched
                    to the gun, and the boys marching along in martial order, soon became the observed of all observers.</p>
            <p>After the procession had marched through the principal streets, and had been dismissed, a firing of
                    cannon was commenced by the Vevay company, and soon after by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> company. The exercise of firing was very good, and the two companies vied with each
                    other which should excel. The <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-020-4-027"/> Vevay company by the rapidity
                    with which they loaded and fired their piece, so far outdid the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> company that they received the praise of every person, and even Gen. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> who was introduced to the captain and his men by John J. Dufour, the father of the
                    captain, gave them the praise of being the most accurate in artillery tactics of any company he had
                    met with on his visit to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He enquired of the captain and his men where they had been instructed in the tactics
                    of artillery, and had quite a long conversation with them. He enquired very particularly how far
                    they had travelled to be present. When informed that they had come about 70 miles, he replied:
                    "My friends, you have put yourself to a great inconvenience to come so far to see me, who
                    am only a man."</p>
            <p>On introducing the general to the Swiss artillerists, John J. Dufour took occasion to make a speech
                    in which he referred to the services of the general during the War of the Revolution, and that the
                    Swiss who then stood before him, had come to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to enjoy the blessings of the government he had been instrumental in securing for his
                    fellow man.</p>
            <p>After firing their gun for several hours, the cartridges gave out, and they had to procure others. It
                    is said that the members of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> company, chagrined on account of the correctness and the rapidity with which the Vevay
                    company went through the exercise of loading and firing, made cartridges for the Vevay gun too
                    large, with the view of retarding them in the rapidity of their firing, but still the Vevay company,
                    although the cartridges were too large, were still able to fire twice or three tomes to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> company's once.</p>
            <p>The two companies tried their skill in rapid firing on the following day, and bets of from one
                    hundred to one thousand dollars were freely offered that the Vevay company could fire two to one,
                    none of which bets were taken.</p>
            <p>The uniform of the company was rather an awkward and heavy one for summer wear. It consisted of a
                    blue dress coat trimmed in scarlet, a bear skin cap about one foot high, rather bell-crowned, and
                    trimmed with scarlet cord and tassel. Well does the writer, who in later years was a member of the
                    company, <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-020-4-028"/> remember how oppressive the great black cap and blue
                    cloth coat buttoned up to the chin, were on fourth of July occasions, when drawn up in line in the
                    hot sun. The uniform of the "Old Specks" of 1862 and 1863 although very oppressive
                    in warm weather, was nothing to compare with that of the old Swiss artillery company.</p>
            <p>Among those members who took part in manning the gun on the visit to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and participated in the festivities of the occasion were the Captain, J. and B. Detrax,
                    S. C. Jones, W. J. Jones, A. Raymond and F. Deserens. Others were of the numbers, but their names
                    are not now recollected.</p>
            <p>Some members of the company were unexpectedly prevented by unforseseen circumstances from being
                    present. Of that number R. Morerod, G. Kessler, J. Vairin and F. L. Grisard can be named, and it is
                    said that some of them were very much disappointed in not being with their comrades.</p>
            <p>The occasion of the visit of Gen. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> was an event that was heralded in the papers of that place and the surrounding country
                    for months before the appointed time for his arrival there.</p>
            <p>After the ceremonies of his reception and the incidents attending, the newspapers of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
               </placeName>, and
                    all the smaller towns, for weeks after, were filled with accounts of the ceremonies, and of the many
                    incidents that occurred on that day; and all of them had to award the praise to the Swiss artillery
                    company of Vevay for the precision and rapidity with which they managed and fired their gun; and it
                    may be said that every member of that company felt proud of belonging to it, whether he was present
                    or absent on the occasion, which elicited so much praise from strangers.</p>
            <p>Many of the statements made in this number are from personal recollection, and others from facts
                    related by some members of the company who took part in the managemnet and firing of "Old
                    Betz" on that occasion.</p>
            <p>At some of the elections held in the early days of the county, some very amusing curcumstances in
                    relation to the candidates and the canvass might be given to show that often the voters cared not so
                    much for the talents of the candidates who were seeking their suffrages as to gratify their passions
                        <pb n="375" id="VAA4025-020-4-029"/> of revenge, malice, and for sporting with the places of
                    honor and trust.</p>
            <p>At an election when a representative to the state legislature was to be chosen Samuel Merrill was a
                    candidate. Certain persons who were opposed to his election, and wishing to defeat him, met together
                    and determined on supporting Daniel Haycock as a candidate in opposition to Mr. Merrill. The canvass
                    was conducted with much spirit by the friends of both candidates. Mr. Merrill's claims on
                    the score of qualifications for the position, were not in the least questioned by any, but his
                    opponents urged against him that he was a Yankee adventurer; that their candidate was a man of the
                    people, and ought to be elected; and all the usual appliances of those early days were used to
                    induce the voters of the county to vote for Daniel Haycock, the peoples’ candidate,
                    against Samuel Merrill, the Yankee adventurer, who had come among us only to get office, which as
                    was urged, he could not get where he came from.</p>
            <p>In those days "whisky" might be said to be king, for with the aid of whisky, many
                    times men of bad habits were elected to fill the offices, while the deserving were left to take
                    "back seats".</p>
            <p>Mr. Merrill was elected, by the friends of Mr. Haycock in one of the townships, voting for a Mr.
                    Lacock, through mistake; or, as some of Haycock's friends alleged, Merrill's few
                    friends in that township putting out tickets with Lacock's name instead of
                    Haycock's on tickets which they had thus prepared for the express purpose of defeating
                    Haycock; be that as it may that error in the ticket secured Mr. Merrill's election to the
                    legislature, and contributed in no small degree to his future position in the state, as treasurer of
                    state for several years, and president of the State Bank of Indiana; for had the votes cast for
                    Lacock been cast for Haycock, he would have been elected by a small majority.</p>
            <p>At another election for a representative in the state legislature there was a candidate before the
                    people who was very acceptable to a great majority of the voters, and it was thought until within
                    ten days or two weeks of the election, he would have no opposition. However, some persons, for mere
                        <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-020-4-030"/> sport, prevailed upon a person living above <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to consent that his name might be used by them as a candidate for representative, to
                    which he consented, and his name was thus announced as a candidate: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>To the voters of <placeName>

                            </placeName>: Having, at the solicitations of my friends and neighbors, consented to become
                            a candidate for Representative in the Legislature of Indiana, I pledge myself, if elected,
                            to use to the utmost my abilities to support such measures only as will be beneficial to the
                            county I represent, and the State at large.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now, be it known that Mr. Miller was an honest old farmer, and. as was the case with many who were
                    raised in the western wilds, was an uneducated man; and in thus consenting to become a candidate no
                    doubt, was like his friends and neighbors, anticipating some rare sport during the remainder of the
                    canvass, and on election day.</p>
            <p>The day for holding the election came, and as Mr. Miller was a resident of Jefferson township, he
                    came to Vevay on the morning of election day, full of fun and frolic, electioneering to secure
                    votes, which he did with a great deal of success at the polls of Jefferson township. During the day,
                    his friends and he himself appeared to be confident of his election, for he went to some of the
                    prominent men about Vevay and assured them that he did not wish to be elected, that he and some of
                    his neighbors, seeing there was no opposition to the person who was a candidate, had determined to
                    have a candidate and some sport out of the matter.</p>
            <p>He appeared to be fearful he might be elected, and stated to some of his friends that if he was
                    elected he did not know what in the devil he would do, for he was not able to fill the place as he
                    ought to fill it, and such other expressions. He received a very fair proportion of the votes cast,
                    but was defeated by a majority of about fifty votes.</p>
            <p>On election days about that time, say from about 1818 to 1838, on entering a grocery where liquor was
                    sold a spectacle presented itself to the eyes of the beholder, that, in these <pb n="377" id="VAA4025-020-4-031"/> days would be such a sight as to horrify many. Persons who, in days
                    gone by, have seen such sights, and have been participants in them having the spectacle placed in
                    such a conspicuous position as to be seen of all the voters who might chance to step into one of
                    those groceries. The spectacle here meant was this: On the morning of elections, each candidate
                    would have a bottle filled with whisky, and his name printed in large letters on his bottle, so that
                    his supporters might drink of his whisky, and thus at a general election on the first Monday in
                    August when several officers were to be elected, and several aspirants for each office, there might
                    have been seen on the the counters from ten to fifteen bottles filled with whisky, with the name of
                    a candidate on each bottle; and as the voting proceeded through the day, those who were watching the
                    interests of their favorite candidates, would step into the grocery to see how the whisky of their
                    favorites was being drank. If the bottle of the friend was full enquiry would be made of the
                    barkeeper how many times he had filled that bottle: If it had been filled oftener than the bottle of
                    his favorite's opponent, he went away with a light heart, assured that his
                    favorite's friends were in the ascendancy.</p>
            <p>And thus the whisky bottle was regarded as the thermometer of the state of the public mind, in
                    relation to the success or defeat of the candidates who were asking them for their suffrages. The
                    time of such sights as this has passed, and many who have been candidates for office, and have had
                    their names placed on one of these thermometers, have been heard often to say that "Whisky
                    and whisky-sellers rule the legislature of Indiana."</p>
            <p>But even in those days, Indiana can boast of some of her most honest legislators; men who had the
                    best interests of the state at heart; men who were not always trying to initiate some scheme or new
                    measure, whereby they might fill their pockets at the expense of the honest farmers and tax payers
                    of the state. It is true, some of them had very crude notions of the best manner to develop the
                    resources of the state.</p>
            <p>As an example, a worthy senator who represented <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ripley</settlement>
                    </placeName> counties in the senate, conceived the singular idea of having a penitentiary erected in
                    such a manner that <pb n="378" id="VAA4025-020-4-032"/> it could be placed upon wheels and hauled
                    along some of the state roads that were then being opened and worked, and made so secure that
                    convicts might be locked up by night and employed during the day in working on the road. In that
                    manner he contended the labor of the convicts could be made available in opening and working the
                    roads throughout the state, that were established by legislative enactment. He advocated his
                    "rolling penitentiary", as it was termed, with much zeal, but failed in having it
                    made a law. This senator was George Craig, and let others have what opinions they may on the
                    subject, would it not be a profitable undertaking at this time?</p>
            <p>At a time when railroads were first spoken of in the legislature of Indiana it is said that a worthy
                    representative, representing one of the counties bordering on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and in whose county the land was in many localities swampy, that in order to have
                    roads that would be of sufficient firmness tc bear up the travel, it was necessary to make what is
                    usually called "corduroy bridges", which are made by placing round poles or split
                    rails lengthwise across the road—replied to a speech made by a real railroad member,
                    "In my county we have as good railroads as in any county in the state of Indiana, or in the
                    world for they are made of oak rails that can not be surpassed by those in any part of the country
                    for durability."</p>
            <p>It is said of another <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash county</region>
                    </placeName> representative, that when a canal was spoken of being built in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> valley, and speaking of the cost of its construction, he declared it as his firm belief
                    that "the cost of the construction of a canal from Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> could be entirely paid in coon skins."</p>
            <p>Thinking some additional facts in relation to navigating the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> rivers and tributaries with barges, keel and flatboats, fifty and sixty years ago,
                    might not be unacceptable to the readers of these numbers, some few of those facts and some
                    incidents connected therewith, will be mentioned in this number.</p>
            <p>John and Joseph Bosseau, who came to Vevay in 1813 with their father and family, were both engaged in
                    navigating <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-020-4-033"/> those rivers soon after their arrival here; Joseph
                    being at this time 78 years of age, and residing on Bee-Tree Run, two and one-half miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and his brother John, being his senior by five years, resides in Wood county, West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Joseph, perhaps, made but one or two trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and back, but made several to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and back, on one occasion making the homeward bound voyage by land, on foot, which was
                    performed in six or seven days. One trip was made up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> river to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> du Chien, with provisions for the garrison stationed at that place. He also made two or
                    three trips up Cumberland river to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>; one or two trips up <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> river to the Mussel Shoals, and but for the obstruction to navigation by those shoals,
                    would have gone farther up that river, having arrived at the shoals too late in the season to be
                    assisted in getting over them.</p>
            <p>Many trips were made by him up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> river as far as Sublett's ferry, to which point iron and groceries of all
                    descriptions were taken and from which tobacco, whisky and bacon were brought down on the return
                    trip. The boat on which he was employed up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> river was in the service of Lewis Sanders, who, about that time, was engaged quite
                    extensively in manufacturing near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, and in merchandising. It is said that
                    John Sanders and Ab. Sanders were engaged in running boats up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> river about this time, but the exact year the writer has not been able to ascertain.</p>
            <p>"Uncle Joe" has also put his shoulder to the pole and assisted in propelling keel
                    boats up the Monongahela river as far as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brownsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which, in those days was known by the appelation of "Redstone."</p>
            <p>It is said that in the very early days of navigating the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and its tributaries, the following dialogue, if it may be so termed, occurred between a
                    person on shore and the captain of a keelboat out in the stream, descending the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>: "Hallo the boat." "Hallo." "What is the
                    name of that boat?" "Yellowstone." "Where is it
                    from?" "Redstone." "Where are you bound
                    to?" "Limestone." "What are you <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-020-4-034"/> loaded with?" "Grindstones."
                    "What is the Captain's name?" "Whetstone."</p>
            <p>Uncle Joe has gone up the Muskingum river in his keelboating to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Zanesville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, several times up to Pittsburg and more times than he has fingers and toes up to
                    Kenawha Salines, taking up whisky, bacon, coffee, sugar and other groceries; and in all those
                    voyages he was said to be the most active and at the same time the best natured person of all the
                    crew, which was generally composed of from six to ten men with poles, and the captain or steersman.
                    The last trip he made in keelboating up to the Kenawha Salines, for Jacob R. Evertson, laden with
                    whisky, bacon, groceries, and a few dry goods, he had as companions several persons from this
                    vicinity, but cannot recollect any of them now except Andrew Roberts, the father of John James
                    Roberts of this place. Uncle Joe says, that, fearing Mr. Evertson would not be willing to allow them
                    rations of whisky, he provided himself with a gimlet, then removing a hoop on the barrel, he bored a
                    hole with his gimlet at which he filled a coffee pot with whisky, stopped the hole, replaced the
                    hoop, and in that way procured a sufficient supply of whisky for himself, Andrew Roberts, and two
                    others (which four made up the mess) during the trip.</p>
            <p>At one time, on leaving Pittsburg, a bet was made by the captain of the keel Uncle Joe was on board
                    of, and the captain of another boat, as to which would beat to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The boat on which Uncle Joe belonged was to start one day ahead of the other boat. On
                    arriving at Biffingtons island, the water being quite low and not of a sufficient depth to admit the
                    passage of the boat, about 100 barrels of whisky were put overboard, and with a rope made fast
                    together by tacking the rope to the barrels. They were sent ahead to their destination at the mouth
                    of Big Sandy, and yet the boat could not pass until stone at the bottom were removed to deepen the
                    channel; and the boat, by this means, was gotten through the shallow channel. But that their
                    competitors might not profit by the channel being thus cleared, the stones thus removed together
                    with others, were thrown back into the channel from which they had been taken—thus making
                    the channel perhaps shallower than they found it. So, when the <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-020-4-035"/>
                    other boat arrived at that point, they could not pass, and were compelled to deepen the channel,
                    which delayed them and Uncle Joe and his companions landed their boat at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> about three days in advance of their competitors.</p>
            <p>John and Joseph Bosseau are said to be the only survivors of those who were engaged in navigating the
                    western waters in those early days with keelboats.</p>
            <p>These facts and incidents are here related as told the writer by Uncle Joe himself, some days since,
                    not for any worth or merit attaching to them, but with the thought that perhaps fifty years hence
                    some of those who may then be on the stage of action may chance to read them, and learn what those
                    who preceded them in the voyage of life had been called upon to do and to suffer that the
                    necessaries of life might be conveyed from one point to another in this now great and prosperous
                    valley of the "father of waters," and his numerous tributaries.</p>
            <p>It is said that John Bosseau is to visit this county soon, and if so, let any ones who are curious to
                    hear from him and his brother Joseph's own lips a recital of their trials, hardships,
                    privations and pleasures, too, call, and perhaps what is here written of them and much more may be
                    learned.</p>
            <p>Some incidents which are said to have occurred at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1825, on the occasion of the visit of the Marquis de <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which have been related and brought to the recollection of the writer by a member of
                    the artillery company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was one of the party, it may be well to have recorded in these numbers, to be
                    handed down to those who come after the present generation.</p>
            <p>It is related that while the Vevay Swiss Artillerists were firing with great rapidity, by some means
                    some fire was dropped on the cartridges, which must have caused the explosion of the whole contents
                    of the box, but for the coolness and presence of mind of Andrew Bornand, whose position was to apply
                    the match to fire the gun, and whose attention was called to notice the coal of fire on one of the
                    cartridges on perceiving which he stepped up to the box very coolly and in a slow, cautious manner,
                    took the fire in his hand, threw it away, and thus saved the cartridges in the box from being set

                    probability might have caused the death of some one of those engaged in manning the gun.</p>
            <p>On some other occasion, Mr. Bornand was priming the gun, the priming burned without setting off the
                    gun. Stepping up to the gun, he commenced to pour the priming from the powder horn by his side, when
                    the gun went off setting the powder in the horn on fire, causing it to explode, burning Mr.
                    Bornand's hand and face considerably, which caused him considerable pain for a few days.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1826, Edward Patton was married, and as was then the custom among the members of the
                    company, "Old Betz" was on the day of the infair brought into requisition to
                    proclaim the joy of the members of the company. While in the act of ramming down a cartridge which
                    proved to be rather large, and which Phillip Betten who was ramming, was unable to get down, Rodolph
                    Morerod (the husband of Mrs. Henrietta Tardy), stepped up, took hold of the rammer with such force
                    as to cause the cartridges to burst, which it was thought was the cause of the gun going off, while
                    he was still in the act of ramming the cartridge home, horribly burning and bruising Mr. Morerod,
                    and melting the buttons on his coat. He was taken home, and after lingering in great suffering for
                    some days he died.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it is said that although the cartridges were made so large that it was with great
                    difficulty they could be rammed home they went through all the artillery exercise in loading and
                    fired twenty-nine times in a little over three minutes, which as heretofore stated, was very
                    generally spoken of by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other western newspapers, as the best artillery exercises ever performed in the

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, up to that time.</p>
            <p>It is related that while <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> was on the platform surrounded by many who were anxious to take by the hand the friend
                    of America when she stood in need of friends, there was observed in the crowd an old and feeble
                    female, who was evidently making her way through the crowd towards the <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-020-4-037"/> platform where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, surrounded by the "bonton" of the surrounding country, was being
                    shaken by the hand and congratulated. At length the old lady gets through the crowd, ascends the
                    platform and taking <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> by the hand, with streaming eyes calls on God to bless him; and addressing herself to
                    the brave and generous <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, she speaks to him thus: "Do you remember me, General?" He
                    informs her that he did not remember or recognize her. She then informed him that while he was
                    imprisoned in the castle of Olmutz she had waited on him during his imprisonment, carrying
                    refreshments to him. Then the General, with tearful eyes, recognizes her, and praying God to protect
                    and defend her, they separated.</p>
            <p>Among the Swiss who first came here were some who, besides being vine dressers in their native
                    country, at which they were occupied during the summer and autumn, some of them went to the
                    mountains with the cows to pasture, and there remained to attend to the cows, made the butter and
                    cheese, during the season best adapted for that purpose, some of the cheese made by them being of an
                    excellent quality. About 1824, some jersons came to this country and brought cheese that had been
                    made by some of the relatives of the Swiss colonists, which was said to be three or four years old,
                    and was so hard that it required a saw to cut it into slices. It was so rich that it would melt when
                    taken into the mouth, and was of an excellent flavor.</p>
            <p>Jean D. Morerod was one of the experts in making good butter and cheese, and many of the older
                    settlers here can bear witness of the quality of the cheese.</p>
            <p>It was remarked some time since that in the early days of the colony, three families united in the
                    purchase of a cow for their joint use. This remark was made by an old settler, but of its
                    correctness the writer cannot say anything, as he does not recollect ever having heard anything of
                    the circumstance until lately.</p>
            <p>It may be strictly correct, for in those days money in the wilderness was not so plenty as in these
                    days of "greenbacks," "bluebacks" and
                    "redbacks", and the settlers had as yet nothing to sell that would command money.</p>
            <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-020-4-038"/>
            <p>The writer well recollects that even as late as 1827, there could not be raised by any one person a
                    sufficient amount of money to pay for the brick house and the lot at the corner of Main Cross and
                    Market streets, which was sold at sheriff's sale. John F. Dufour, <placeName>
                        <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                    </placeName> R. Whitehead and Thomas Armstrong, joining together, could raise money enough to pay
                    the bid, which was made in the name of the three, and that amount was $307.</p>
            <p>At that time money was scarce and hard to be had, even though a person had produce to sell. Then
                    wheat was selling at about 311/4 cents per bushel; corn about 121/2, and other productions farmers
                    had to sell in proportion.</p>
            <p>Seeing an article in some newspaper lately, giving an account of the condition of Steven C. Stevens,
                    who has had the sad misfortune to have his mental faculties so shattered that it has been necessary
                    to have him placed in the Insane Asylum, has called to the mind of the writer that Judge Stevens,
                    who was first admitted to the practice of the law at the bar of the <placeName>

                    legislature of Indiana, and then a senator, and was appointed one of the judges of the supreme court
                    of Indiana; and that although he had talents of no ordinary kind, yet an Allwise Creator has
                    permitted disease, in the worst form, to overtake him in his riper years.</p>
            <p>Judge Stevens and Hon. Jeremiah Sullivan are the only surviving attorneys of the territorial courts
                    in this part of the state.</p>

                    good schools, such as the youth of Vevay have at the present day.</p>
            <p>In 1816, 1817, and 1818, the first school was opened, in which Greek and Latin, and the higher
                    branches of English literature were taught. The school was conducted by Alexander Holton, who gave
                    public notice of his school in the following card, published in the Indiana Register in November,

            <p>Mr. Holton was an accomplished scholar, and his school was well patronized, considering the small
                    number of scholars in the town and vicinity to be taught.</p>
            <p>A Mr. Wilson, a Baptist preacher, taught school in Vevay in a small log house which stood on Ferry
                    street, on the lower part of the lot on which the Russell house now stands. That house had
                    previously been occupied as a horse mill, but about the time of its occupancy as a place where the
                    young idea was taught to shoot, the mill was removed from town. This was in the fall of 1815. In Mr.
                    Wilson's school, Orthography, Reading and Writing only were taught.</p>
            <p>James Rous, the father of Ladig and Percy Rous, in 1814 and 1815, taught school in the Seminary of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was a one story hewed log house, about twenty or twenty-five feet long by twelve
                    or fifteen feet wide, with a door in one end, and for windows, one log on each side, was cut out,
                    and a sash with perhaps twenty or twenty-five glass in each, in a single row, was fitted into the
                    opening made for the window. In this house the writer was a scholar for a year or more and among his
                    schoolmates who attended that school he can now name but few who are living: John Scott, now Dr.
                    Scott, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    Esq., who left this place about a year ago for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, and perhaps Wm. W. Huston, of York township.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Julia L. Dumont, whose reputation as a successful teacher is well known in this community,
                    commenced teaching about the year 1820, and for many years delighted to give <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-020-4-040"/> instruction and her kind advice to the boys and girls who were placed
                    under her care for educational purposes. She was perhaps the most successful and efficient teacher
                    that ever imparted instruction in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This, by no means is said to detract from the merits of any who have been called to
                    teach in our public schools since she ceased from teaching. Many of the present fathers and mothers
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who were pupils under Mrs. Dumont, and obtained their education under her teaching,
                    lived to see their children receive their education, so far as the English language was taught, by
                    her and under her instruction.</p>
            <p>Sylvanus Waldo, a brother to the father of 0. 5. and J. F. Waldo, taught school here, but the length
                    of time is not recollected nor the year during which he taught. He was taken sick while his school
                    was being carried on, and it is thought he died from the effects of that sickness.</p>
            <p>One James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> taught a school in the log house which stood on the lot on Main street now occupied by
                    R. F. Grisard. This school was kept for several years, and although Mr. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> was reputed a cross and severe teacher, yet his scholars improved rapidly under his
                    tuition. In that school the writer made most of his advance in his studies. Most of his schoolmates
                    in that school have removed from this place; but a majority of them have been called to
                    "that bourne from whence no traveler returns." This school was taught perhaps in
                    1820, ‘21 and ‘22.</p>
            <p>At one time, the exact date not recollected, one Wick commenced a school in a frame building which
                    stood on Main street nearly opposite the court house, which was continued but a short time, for want
                    of sufficient patronage. Sometime during the year 1822 or 1823, Isaac B. Kinsman, a downeastern,
                    from the banks of the Kennebec river, in the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>, came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and commenced school teaching. He was a good scholar, and capable of teaching Latin,
                    Greek and Hebrew. He continued teaching school at intervals until perhaps in the fall of 1825. He
                    was in the habit of indulging too freely in the use of intoxicating liquors, which unfitted him at
                    times for his avocation. He had a very good school, and gave general satisfaction in his teaching,
                    for he never <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-020-4-041"/> kept his school open while intoxicated. In April,
                    1824, he concluded to abandon school teaching and turn his attention to trading. Accordingly he gave
                    notice that he wished to purchase a large quantity of turkeys, ducks and good chickens, to be
                    delivered in Vevay on three days of the week following, for which he promised to pay in specie, for
                    chickens 50 cents per dozen for a single dozen or 621/2 cents per dozen for five dozen or more,
                    brought at one time by the same person. Same price for ducks and 25 cents apiece for turkeys.</p>
            <p>He collected together a good number of each and took them down the river, making quite a good
                    speculation by the operation. He was a ready writer, and the paper published in Vevay at the time
                    was made interesting by his contributions. One of his articles published in the Indiana Register,
                    September 17, 1824, reads thus: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>In September, 1824, a man and wife were living near <placeName>

                    </placeName>, not very harmoniously together, the wife left the husband and went to live in the
                    family of a neighbor. As usual in such cases, the deserted husband gave notice in the public paper
                    that his wife had left his bed and board, and was living in adultery with the neighbor where she had
                    gone to stay. Kinsman hearing of the affair sought an opportunity to see the man with whom the

            <p>In the legislature of Indiana during the session of 1823 and ‘24 which was the last held

                    </placeName>, was represented by Stephen C. Stevens and Ralph Cotton. During that session the laws
                    of the state were revised, and in the revision of the bill relative to crime and punishment, the
                    following section was inserted, (see page 145 of Journal of proceedings of the Senate): <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The mass of the people were much opposed to such a law being in force in Indiana, and thought it

            <p>Some of the prominent men and aspirants for office in this part of Indiana, particularly in the Third
                    congressional district, were opposed to the candidates for President on different grounds. Some

                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and Jackson because they were slaveholders, and lived in slave states. Some opposed Mr.

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> City, and was an owner of slaves.</p>
            <p>Some of the aspirants for congress in the Third district were said to favor the election of Jackson
                    while here in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland county</country>

                    </placeName> or Adams were more prominent, they advocated the election of the one or the other, as
                    the one or the other was the most prominent.</p>
            <p>At length the election came and it would appear from the result that outside of Vevay and the
                    vicinity the people cared nothing about who was the President. The result in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland county</country>
                    </placeName> was as follows: Jackson, 161; <placeName>

            <p>The election over, everybody glad "on it", as Brother Jonathan said. The friends of
                    the several candidates who previous to the election could not say a civil word of or to each other
                    soon began to harmonize and associate together as was their usual custom. The unusual small number
                    of votes cast was owing to several causes: Polls were opened in three townships only, and the votes
                    of but one counted— the returning judge from one township came in without the
                    return—the other brought his return, but not being in legal form it was rejected;
                    however, the judges reported it to the secretary of state specially. In Posey township Jackson had
                    66 and Adams 46 votes. In Cotton township Jackson had 25, Adams 23, and <placeName>

            <p>In these times of high taxes and burdens upon the tax payers of the county of which we hear so much
                    said every day where an assemblage of people are met, and of which we read in every newspaper
                    published in our land, it may be interesting to those who read these articles to know something
                    about the burdens and taxes borne by the people forty or fifty years ago.</p>
            <p>These things can be seen by any person who would take the trouble of examining the records of county
                    affairs on file in the auditor's office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, so far as relates to the county of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the archives of state at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> so far as relates to the state finances. But that every person and tax-payer of the
                    county who reads the Democrat may have a glimpse at these matters, a few statements in relation
                    thereto will be given in these numbers from time to time. The first will be a
                    "statement" of the financial concerns of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland county</country>
                    </placeName> from the 16th of November, 1822, to the 12th of November, 1823, inclusive. It appears
                    that on the 15th of November, 1822, there was a deficit of $914.20, in other words the
                    county was in debt to that amount at that date. The amount of the duplicate placed in the hands of
                    the collector for the year 1823 amounted to the sum of $1,126.80, and the amount of the
                    other receipts were $288.64, making the total amount of receipts for the county provided
                    the whole amount on the duplicate was collected, $1,415.44. The total amount of
                    expenditures, including the $914.20, the amount of the <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-020-4-047"/> deficit for the year 1822 as above stated, was $2,387.05; from which it will be seen
                    that the indebtedness of the county on the 12th of November, 1823, was $971.61, showing
                    that instead of paying off the debt of the previous year, the indebtedness of the county was
                    increased.</p>
            <p>This statement shows that the whole amount of taxes collected and on the duplicate for that year
                    amounted to $1,415.44.</p>
            <p>At the August election, 1824, the number of votes cast for the three candidates for congress in the
                    county was 621. By dividing the amount of taxes imposed on the voters of the county for that year by
                    the number of votes will show that the taxes was about $2.28 for each voter. And yet
                    there was a deficit of $971.611/2 which would have required an additional tax of about
                    $1.56 on each voter to pay that deficiency, and would have required a tax of about
                    $3.84 on each voter for that year.</p>
            <p>About this time county orders were offered for sale by those holding them at 50 cents on the dollar,
                    without purchasers, except in suitable amounts for tax payers to pay their county taxes. How very
                    different from what these matters are at this time. The amount of taxes charged on the duplicate,
                    the receipts and expenditures of the county, and the number of voters in the county at present only
                    can make the reader realize the difference.</p>
            <p>It appears that the receipts and expenditures of the state from the commencement of the State
                    government in 1816 to the first of January, 1823, made an aggregate of $113,230.34
                    received at the state treasury during that period from taxes alone, to which is added revenue of the
                    territory, receipts on account of seat of government, salt springs and incidental receipts to make
                    the aggregate of receipts from all sources amount to $183,185.51 while the aggregate of
                    expenditures amounted to $170,686.53, and leaving a balance in the treasury on the first
                    of January, 1824, of $12,498.53; which, to the casual observer would appear to be a very
                    satisfactory financial condition for the young state to boast of, after an existence of only seven
                    years.</p>
            <p>But for all this good showing, the financial affairs of the <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-020-4-048"/>
                    state it is said were in a very unsatisfactory condition, for on the assembling of the legislature
                    on the first Monday in December, 1823, the governor communicated to that body the situation of the
                    affairs of the state. On taking a view of the financial concerns of the state, together with the
                    situation of the departments of the auditor and treasurer, it was deemed advisable to make a
                    thorough examination and exhibit of those departments from the beginning of the state government up
                    to the first of January, 1824. To do this would require the constant labor of a master book-keeper
                    and accountant for something near thirty days. Numbers of the members of the legislature could have
                    ably performed that service but none of them were willing to leave the house and their other
                    business entirely to attend to that; hence it became necessary to employ some person to perform that
                    service. The Hon. Isaac <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Blackford</region>
                    </placeName> was called upon, and although the task was almost Herculean yet he undertook it and in
                    about thirty days went through both departments from the first day of the state government up to the
                    first day of January, 1824, and made a detailed report in writing, exhibiting in a clear, plain and
                    satisfactory manner the true situation of the financial concerns of the state. The report was a
                    document of great importance, inasmuch as it was the foundation of a new era in the management of
                    the departments of the auditor and treasurer of state. The treasury department at the beginning of
                    that session of the legislature was much embarrassed and pressed for payment, and the legislature
                    was compelled to provide either by the re-issue of treasury notes or by loan, the sum of about
                    $20,000 to meet the payments of the state debts which were then due and daily becoming
                    due. The governor had recommended a loan and that plan for raising the required amount was adopted,
                    without hesitation, and an act passed authorizing a loan of any sum not exceeding
                    $19,000.</p>
            <p>The re-issue of treasury notes were opposed on the ground well known to all, that there were no funds
                    to redeem them, and that it would have been countenancing the odious principle of banking without
                    capital which in their opinion would have been an indirect species of swindling. It was supposed <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-020-4-049"/> by some that the system of loaning might at first be unpopular,
                    but firmly believing that it was the only true policy which could be adopted by which the credit of
                    the state could be preserved, and that it would stand the test of honesty, wisdom and time, it was
                    finally adopted without a dissenting voice.</p>
            <p>A law was passed by that legislature removing the seat of government from Corydon to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the first day of January, 1825; and the next General Assembly was to convene there
                    on the second Monday in January, 1825.</p>
            <p>That General Assembly was constituted as follows: The House of Representatives consisted of 27
                    farmers, 3 mechanics, 5 doctors, 1 private gentleman, 4 merchants and 6 lawyers, making in all 46
                    members. The Senate consisted of 11 farmers, 2 tavern-keepers, 1 doctor, 1 merchant, and 3 lawyers,
                    making in all 18 members, including the lieutenant governor.</p>
            <p>At that session of the legislature the votes cast for and against the calling of a convention to
                    change the constitution of the state were examined and officially announced as follows: No
                    convention, 11,991; convention, 2,601; majority against a convention, 9,390. Nearly half the
                    counties neglected to make returns to the secretary of state.</p>
            <p>The financial operations of the state treasury for the year 1824 were more successful than was
                    anticipated by the most sanguine. Of the $19,000 supposed to be necessary to be procured
                    by loans only $5,971 was procured, and of that sum $975 was seminary funds
                    unemployed in the treasury. So beneficial to the treasury was the change of system that the current
                    expenditures were more easily and promptly met with that amount than they were the previous year by
                    a re-issue of $15,000 of treasury notes; and with the additional advantage, that on the
                    expenditures authorized by the legislature of the previous year the state paid interest on
                    $5,971 only, while on that authorized by the legislature at its preceding session
                    interest was paid on $15,000. In addition the public credit was maintained, the currency
                    restored to soundness and much of the public expenditure economized, in proportion as the currency
                    was rescued from depreciation.</p>
            <p>The receipts into the treasury during the year 1824 <pb n="396" id="VAA4025-020-4-050"/> amounted to
                    $40,435.94, by which the treasury notes were redeemed in good faith, and the audited
                    warrants paid, and there was on the 10th of January, 1825, in the treasury in available funds
                    $12,508.</p>
            <p>The state debt amounted on the 1st of January, 1824, to $27,044.19. On the 1st of January,
                    1825, it amounted to $17,499.17 exclusive of interest. That indebtedness consisted of
                    $4,655 treasury notes then in circulation, $5,971 loan, $5,000 of
                    which the state owed to roads and canals and $1,373.17 on bonds transferred to the
                    treasury of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The state debt on the 10th of January, 1825, exclusive of interest, exceeded the
                    actual cash in the treasury, $4,991.15.</p>
            <p>The revenue for 1824, after deducting the per cent for collecting amounted to $39,294.86.
                    The current expenditures of the year 1825 were estimated not to exceed $21,000, and a
                    reduction of all contingent expenses was confidently expected.</p>
            <p>Sometime in the spring of 1824, the murder of some Indians on the frontier settlements of the state,
                    by whites, created a great sensation in the northern portion of the state. The perpetrators of that
                    murder were arrested and imprisoned in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> county. As <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> county was a new county, sparsely settled, having no public buildings, it became
                    necessary for want of a proper jail in which to keep the prisoners, to maintain a guard over them
                    for safe keeping. The expenses of keeping up such guard from the month of March, 1824 until some
                    time in January, 1825, considering the newness of the county the sparseness of its population and
                    the deleterious effects of the case on its general prosperity the governor, in his message to the
                    legislature on its convening at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on the 10th of January, 1825, recommended that the expenses incident to the safe
                    keeping of the prisoners for which the county might be liable, be paid out of the state treasury.</p>
            <p>The further details of this most unpleasant transaction appear to be that James Hudson, one of the
                    persons charged with the murder of Logan, an Indian chief, was at the October term, 1824, of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> county circuit court, convicted and sentenced to be executed on the first day of
                    December, 1824; that previous to the day appointed for his execution he <pb n="397" id="VAA4025-020-4-051"/> escaped from prison, and that he might not escape the punishment of his
                    crimes by becoming a fugitive from justice, the time of his execution was, on the suggestion of the
                    presiding judge and the prosecuting attorney of that court, respited and postponed by the governor
                    of the state till the 12th of January, 1825.</p>
            <p>Whether the prisoner, James Hudson, was ever retaken and made expiate for his crimes by being
                    executed, the writer does not know.</p>
            <p>As a part of the history of the "slavery" controversy which has been brought to an
                    end by having slavery prohibited by the constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, it may be something new to many and may bring to the minds of others who have
                    forgotten it to here state that in 1824 the legislature of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> passed a resolution proposing an amendment to the constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> which would prohibit "the importation or ingress of any person of color into

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, contrary to the laws of such State;" and that resolutions were passed in <placeName>

                    </placeName> disapproving of that resolution.</p>
            <p>The legislature of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> about the same time adopted resolutions recommending to the legislatures of the several

                    </placeName>, a system providing for the gradual emancipation of slaves, and recommending the
                    passage of an act by the general government (with the consent of the slave holding states), by which
                    the children of such persons born after the passage of such act should on certain conditions be free
                    at the age of twenty-one years. These resolutions were received by the governor of Indiana and were
                    accompanied with requests that they be laid before the legislature of the state.</p>

                    a host of persons came also seeking as usual to be officers and waiters on the noble representatives
                    of the people, as well as of the good people of the state, some who were willing for the good of the
                    people to exchange good, fat honorable offices for better ones, and many others who had none at all,
                    willing to take upon themselves the duties of any officer, provided they were well paid for it. Some
                    men in those days for a little money and an easy berth were willing to do anything to make an honest
                    living. How much better it would have been for many of those stout, able-bodied fellows, if they had
                    turned into the woods as many were doing and there have laid the axe at the <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-020-4-053"/> root of the tree, and have assisted in clearing away the rubbish. They
                    would have then have been doing permanent service to themselves, their families and the state, too.
                    But this would have been hard work, they did not like to undertake it. If they were talked to on the
                    subject, they would say "I cannot do it; my family would not like it,
                    &amp;c.," making an hundred excuses to turn the subject to that of the favorite
                    subject, an office. One wished to go to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate, B. wished to be secretary of state, C. supreme or presiding judge, and so on to
                    the end of the alphabet.</p>
            <p>Then would come a long story to enlist the feelings of the representative addressed in favor of the
                    office seeker. One had been unfortunate; one was poor; one has a large family to maintain; with a
                    long list of arguments which had already become as familiar as the old mail carrier's horn,
                    when he had arrived in the vicinity of your postoffice. These things have not changed as rapidly as
                    many other things within the state and nation, for at every assembling of our legislatures there are
                    about half a dozen office seekers for each member, and instead of this thirst for office abating it
                    only increases as the population increases, and will continue increasing until every man shall be
                    compelled to take his turn in discharging the duties of the offices for a mere pittance as our grand
                    and traverse jurors are compelled to serve, each one taking his turn.</p>
            <p>Not long since the writer was looking over an old paper and came across the following notice, which
                    is given here as a specimen of what was done in Indiana nearly fifty years ago; the article reads
                    thus: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>If such transactions took place in Indiana fifty years ago, may we not expect to hear and see the
                    same transactions enacted in this, our day and generation. Whether true or false think and ponder on
                    the probabilities of such affairs being of frequent occurrence in our midst, and that before many
                    years roll around.</p>

                    track or all use the then existing city lines, was not brought to the front until several months
                    later when the number of prospective lines into the city made it necessary to establish a policy. If
                    each company constructed its own entrance the city was threatened with an unsightly and dangerous
                    network of tracks; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents opposed such a scheme. On the other hand the use of the city street car lines
                    would hamper the service of both the city and intercity cars. The city railway asked a larger rent
                    than the interurban officials thought reasonable. City officials, with the eye always open for new
                    ways of obtaining public revenues, obdurately refused to grant any more franchises for use of city
                    lines or for private right-of-ways unless the contracts provided for a certain desired car rate. The
                    Union Traction company accepted the terms of the city officials with very little protest, while the
                    other lines waged a fight for a reduced rate. In March, 1900, Mr. C. L. Henry<hi rend="sup">1</hi>,

                    being taxed, a single equivalent tax directed against the terminal company be levied. The blocking

                    one of the first states to develop electric traction she is not so favored in population and
                    geographic conditions as others. The interurbans spread over the state rapidly. The rapid rise and
                    decline of interest in electric railway building is difficult to account for. The first to
                    demonstrate that electric traction was a feasible means of transportation over rough country
                    districts as well as over city streets, were the lines constructed around <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> and Anderson in 1898 and 1899, and from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1899. These lines returned a larger profit than their builders expected and
                    immediately there was a rush to obtain franchises and charters authorizing the construction of lines
                    that would likewise surely reward the builders most lavishly. The very suddenness with which this
                    conviction swept the investing public probably caused men to be carried away with undue enthusiasm.
                    The energy of each promoter's neighbor excited him all the more, until an astonishing
                    proportion of citizens in the commonwealth were sanguinely awaiting rich reward each from his
                    $100 share of capital stock. The first five years of the twentieth century was the most
                    active period; as a writer in the <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Sentinel</hi> said concerning these early years, "The people of the Gas
                    Belt count that day lost whose sun in setting, shines on no new electric railway scheme."</p>
            <p>The earlier promotions took place in the Gas Belt and the larger cities. Each group of promoters had
                    its rivals; and when the competition became too strong in those places the small towns in the less
                    densely populated districts were visited by the ubiquitous surveyor or way-getter. The vast number
                    of schemes that progressed so far as to secure charters and franchises and to sell enough of the
                    capital stock to make a survey is a remarkable fact. In general the first promotions and most of the
                    later ones projected in the small towns contemplated short lines. This fact betrays the prevalent
                    idea that electric railways were adapted to short hauls. The carrying of freight and through
                    traffic, it was thought, could never be wrested from the powerful steam roads who were already on
                    the ground. A few years’ experience convinced traction men that the electric railways
                    were adapted to long hauls as well as short ones.</p>

            <p>Like the steam roads the electric railways are depending more and more upon their freight traffic as
                    a source of income. Because the volume of the freight traffic and the operating cost per ton-mile is
                    more advantageous for long hauls, there is a considerable field for new business that the
                    interurbans can draw upon. During the last ten years the receipts from freight traffic have
                    increased much more rapidly than from the passenger traffic. For the fiscal year 1912-1913 the
                    Evans-ville, Suburban &amp; Newburg railway earned $77,797 conveying passengers and
                    $43,795 freight hauling; in 1921 there was an increase of 194% in passenger receipts and
                    an increase of 256% in freight receipts.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>It is now evident after pursuing the wrong policy from the beginning, that short radiating lines from
                    the larger cities ending at small towns can make but poor returns on an investment. Indiana has no

                    the Calumet region, though the latter extension would be of doubtful success because of the few
                    cities along the route.</p>
            <p>While these connections would reward the electric railway owners with a great increase in traffic,
                    there is small likli-hood of their construction because of the impossibility of financing any new
                    interurban project. Traction officials are unanimous in saying that no more new lines are needed;
                    only a few badly needed connections are advisable. The early builders invested so much capital in
                    unwise ventures that the industry must suffer enormous loss until it can without too much waste
                    abandon or connect the various units. The owners of the unprofitable ventures have been loathe to
                    abandon their lines because they hoped that ultimately the investment of so much capital would be
                    rewarded; but many of the short lines that are a financial burden must be abandoned.</p>
            <p>A powerful enemy was found in the steam roads who opposed the traction lines by every means that
                    could be employed. A railroad which had expended enormous sums of money upon its road-bed and
                    rolling stock very naturally considered the interurban an unscrupulous rival when it boldly built
                    its roadway alongside that of the older line. The operating charges of the railroad are nearly
                    constant, regardless of fluctuations in the volume of traffic; when the interurbans deprived the
                    steam lines of a portion of their passenger and light freight traffic it would seem that the profits
                    were eliminated while the expense of maintaining the schedule was the same as formerly. The real
                    effect upon the old lines was not so serious as might have been expected; although it may have been
                    due to a disinclination to admit loss, the railroads denied any large losses, asserting that the
                    very gradual encroachment of the interurban lines upon their business was more than offset by
                    natural increase in traffic. A very prevalent opinion in those days was that the new form of
                    transportation would win the passenger traffic and leave the heavy freight hauling to the old lines.

            <p>A means of combatting the traction lines was to compel them to construct expensive crossings. By the
                    provisions of an Indiana statute when a railway crosses another line the building company must bear
                    all the expense of constructing the crossing; this provision afforded the older steam lines a
                    convenient weapon. The opposition of the <placeName>

            <p>Another means of combating the interurbans was to refuse to interchange freight. This was not a very
                    serious handicap for the electric lines in their early existence because no strong effort was made
                    to secure the freight trade. In September, 1907, however, the Indiana Railroad commission, in the
                    case of Farmland Stove company, Farmland, vs. Big Four and Union Traction company held that the
                    interurbans were "common carriers" and, therefore, the steam roads were bound to
                    interchange freight with them.</p>
            <p>Besides the financial waste in duplicating expensive equipment when the traction lines constructed
                    lines parallel to the steam roads there were other serious mistakes committed in the industry itself
                    that will require many years of unprofitable service before the industry can be placed upon an
                    economical basis. At first the newly constructed roads required very little repairs and the novelty
                    of electric traction gave an unnatural though short-lived stimulus to the building of lines of
                    railway. Moreover electric street cars had been used less than a score of years before inter-city
                    traction was begun, and the first cars used in the country were city cars. To meet the sudden demand
                    for cars better adapted to the high speed and greater capacity necessary for the rural lines the
                    manufacturers hastily designed a new type of car. The use of electricity as a motive power was a
                    recent application. While motors, generating machinery, and transmission of current at high voltage
                    for long distances were still in the experimental stage there was a sudden and wide spread demand
                    for electric cars and stationery equipment.</p>
            <p>As a consequence the investors in interurban stocks and bonds <pb n="432" id="VAA4025-020-4-086"/>
                    invested enormous sums in machines and materials that were experiments which could result only in
                    loss-a loss which could have been avoided if the growth of interurban systems had been more slow and
                    engineering problems worked out during a long period of years.</p>

                    Indiana interurban railway builders because of the investment of so much capital in the untried
                    machinery. The cost of electrical equipment has increased so much within the last few years that an
                    operating company cannot afford to discard antiquated and inefficient equipment as long as it is
                    possible to use it at all.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within the last nine years there have been no electric railway lines built. Just before the World war
                    there was a revival of interest in interurbans, many new projects were promoted, and, in some cases,
                    considerable grading was done. Since the year 1913, when the shadow of the crisis was first seen in
                    the financial world, there has been no extensions or new constructions except for double tracking,
                    sidings or switches.</p>
            <p>An evil that early began to handicap the rapidly growing industry was the inflation of stock. The

                    excursion trips to "the city" no longer attract crowds of pleasure seekers: those
                    erstwhile excursionists are now driving half way across the state to spend the evening with an
                    intimate friend. The cost per passenger mile for the man who drives his own car is very much greater
                    than for railway transportation; but the freedom of a private car is the deciding factor.</p>
            <p>The recent application of the gasoline vehicle for commercial transportation is a grave menace to the
                    freight and passenger traffic of the interurban lines. The highest development of the jitney bus has
                    been in the east; in a certain town in <placeName>

                    </placeName> several suburban lines have been forced to stop running cars, and many others have

                    the same difficulty that they themselves thrust upon the steam roads two decades ago. A very
                    pertinent question is, "Does the interurban railway possess a means of preservation from
                    successful competition such as the steam road had in its freight traffic" and through
                    passenger service? That means may be found in a development of light parcel delivery or
                    of heavy freight transportation; or it may be discovered in long distance passenger carrying. Again,
                    there may be no need to surrender even short distance hauling to the jitneys, either because of the
                    inability of the jitney to bear up under traffic conditions, or because the jitney may largely
                    develop its own trade, perhaps working in harmony with the interurbans. Many traffic officials very
                    wisely refrain from assailing the jitney on the grounds that it is an uneconomical and unreliable
                    carrier, and advocate co-operation with it.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> As a forerunner and developer of
                    traffic in new districts and as a feeder in regions unsuited to railway building, the jitney would
                    no longer be a rival. Such use is that of the Anderson-Nobles-ville jitney line whose schedule
                    appears in the Union Traction company time table, and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Owing to the lack of detailed, authoritative, and long-time data upon jitney operation there can be
                    but little said upon the relative utility of the two forms of transportation under discussion.
                    Interurban operators are arguing that it is unfair to permit the jitneys to operate over publicly
                    maintained highways, while the electric railways must build their own roadway. The jitneys are
                    accused of being irresponsible and tending to create traffic jams on city streets; the jitneys are
                    more irregular in schedule and are likely to withdraw from operation during unfavorable weather. The
                    absence of any responsibility by the jitneys for adhering to a schedule is unfair to the interurbans
                    who must maintain a fixed schedule under all conditions; but it is doubtful whether a jitney or a

                    policeman at the street corner. An honest contest between commercial jitneys and the interurbans
                    would result in a readjustment that would be for the best interests of the carriers and the public.;
                    but an unregulated warfare, especially by the Ford owner who finds himself out of employment and
                    "picks up" a few passengers while operating for an indefinite period is
                    economically destructive. Time will test the utility of the jitney and relegate it to its proper
                    economic sphere.</p>

            <p>Any account of the development of electric railways in Indiana would be incomplete without some
                    attention being paid to the vast number of fruitless promotions. All schemes that related to the
                    existing lines have been mentioned in their appropriate place; but a surprising number of proposed
                    electric traction lines that were never built were planned in regions not only where no lines are
                    now operating but where no line could profitably operate because of the sparce population and
                    engineering difficulties that interpose. As separate historical facts, these schemes possess little
                    value but considered in relation to the other successful promotions, and studied as facts indicative
                    of the popular and professional attitude toward the new and rapidly spreading system of traction
                    they are of considerable interest.</p>
            <p>During the early years of the present century speculators were impressed by the success of the few
                    lines then operating and wished to have their share of the gains. A charter for the construction of
                    an electric line was thought to be of great value while entailing but small personal liability to
                    the owners.</p>
            <p>A few of these early promotions are to be treated separately and with some detail; but in order to
                    avoid monotony the remaining companies are arranged alphabetically and the date of incorporation,
                    capitalization, names of organizers, proposed route and all other available information is given in
                    a very brief form. All incorporated companies sold enough capital stock to make a survey; if any
                    construction was done, mention is made of the fact. In general, the cause of failure of the schemes
                    was lack of capital. Most of the promotions <pb n="437" id="VAA4025-020-4-091"/> were not feasible;
                    and many of the few which were practicable died during the financial crises of 1896, 1906-7 and
                    1913—14.</p>

            <p>The prologue consisted of a dance of the years escorting TIME, clad in gray with silver coat of mail

                            year Time bids you pause— Why call to mind this history? Because The
                            lives these people lived, the deeds they've done Are what we call tradition; this a
                            cloth begun Of which we weave the pattern; they the warp and woof. Their lives to us a
                            standard, some a stern reproof To keep our pattern beautiful; the fabric hold aloof. Nor
                            time, nor change, nor passing years can dim The love and reverence mem'ry holds
                            them in.</p>

            <p>First Episode-The naming of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This scene was historically accurate. Named for a large granite boulder located on a
                    high spot in what is now the center of the town. In the first interlude the Spirit of the Rock
                    becomes the Spirit of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> through her awakening and crowing by Progress accompanied by History and Vision. These

                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to be Love, Honor and Fraternity.</p>
            <pb n="466" id="VAA4025-020-4-120"/>
            <p>The dances of the Flowers and Butterflies followed by those of the Laughing Waters and the Clouds
                    made a most beautiful and artistic setting for this interlude.</p>
            <p>Episodes and interludes followed in prompt order, depicting the unfolding of the religious,
                    educational, political, commercial and social development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and also of the Spirit of Patriotism which has ever been a characteristic of town and
                    county.</p>
            <p>The Postlude-The dances of the Hours and the Years, during which TIME escorts the Spirit of
                    Rockkville giving her and the attendants into the hands of Futurity. All exit led by Progress,
                    History and Vision. The Epilogue spoken by MUTATION the inexorable companion of TIME: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>This beautiful production was witnessed by an audience variously estimated from five to eight
                    thousand of Parke's population and returned exiles who never lose their love for the county
                    of their nativity.</p>
            <p>Among these visitors was the Honorable Joseph G. Cannon, who motored from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Ills</region>
               </placeName>., to witness the centennial exercises. When the audience learned that
                    this distinguished visitor was present a persistent call for a few words from him was made. Mr.
                    Cannon responded in a few gracious words of greeting and congratulation. Another visitor of whom
                    Parke county is proud was Dr. Harlow Lindley, director of State Historical commission-a Parke county
                    boy.</p>
            <p>Many other returned wanderers might be mentioned did time and space permit.</p>
            <p>Thus closed the 100 years of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s existence and we passed to larger and more unique phases of historical
                    activity in the second and greatest distinctive historical accomplishment of our society, viz: The
                    photo play of the entire county, setting forth on the screen authentic records of events past and
                    present, of beautiful and picturesque scenery, historic relics and remains, etc., in 12,000 feet of
                    film, almost 200,000 pictures comprising more than 600 scenes.</p>
            <pb n="467" id="VAA4025-020-4-121"/>
            <p>All who were privileged to witness the reels of The Chronicles of America, which were shown during
                    the State History conference in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> last December were duly impressed with the fact that from the standpoint of social
                    service, the enterprise undertaken by the Yale University Press to summarize and set forth on the
                    motion picture screen the entire history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in a series of Chronicles of America, was and ever will remain an undertaking of the
                    highest and finest educational and patriotic value conceived in this Century, because it not only
                    makes history visual, but makes it both interesting and educational.</p>
            <p>The thought came-Why, in a small way, should not our state or even the counties do what the Yale
                    University press is doing in a large way?</p>
            <p>The opportunity to test this theory came to us of Parke county in an unexpected and very gratifying
                    manner. Mr. Barnett Harris, of <placeName>

                    private to captain for meritorious service and who since that period has attained high honor as an
                    artist in the filming world, has perfected inventions in movie picture machinery of very great

            <p>When this busy man of large affairs, through happy memories of his boyhood days, offered to film our
                    county, contributing his time and labor, the completed film to cost us nothing except actual
                    expenses of material, travel, etc., we were wise enough to grasp such a magnanimous offer. But
                    historical societies, i. e., county ones, are generally poor as the proverbial church mouse, Parke
                    county is no exception. Again we <pb n="468" id="VAA4025-020-4-122"/> were under a lucky star. The
                    directors of our independent Chautauqua offered us a day in the Chautauqua programme to finance the
                    filming and pageant,if the historical society would assume the responsibility of the entire
                    enterprise; which offer we gladly accepted.</p>
            <p>Thus to the co-operation of Prof. J. A. Linebarger and his associates, we owe the completion of the
                    Parke county photoplay, as well as the production of the pageant.</p>
            <p>Capt. Harris began his filming in the spring before the schools of the various townships closed;
                    hence every school and school building in the county appears on the screen. Close-ups of the pupils
                    and teachers,-and their varied out-door activities.</p>
            <p>The churches and congregations, including the Sunday schools are given prominence. At Bloomingdale,
                    the Friends church is shown with congregation at fourth day service. This is the only church in our
                    county which still observes this midweek worship.</p>
            <p>The fraternal organizations, clubs, societies and industries, sites and remains of extinct
                    industries, such as tan-yards, potteries, iron foundries, etc., all filmed. Many of the oldest
                    citizens of the county also have their places of honor. Among these many interesting pictures is
                    that of the Hon. Joseph G. Cannon, at the home of a friend, Mr. A. C. Crays here in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and also at the old Cannon home in <placeName>

                    </placeName> visitor during this filming and we are happy to have him caught in the movie with Capt.
                    Harris.</p>
            <p>Parke county is rich in beautiful and picturesque scenery. Capt. Harris with true artistic eye caught
                    many of these exquisite bits of nature's handiwork as well as some lovely results of
                    cultivation. One of these is an old-fashioned flower garden. A thing of delight in itself, but the
                    interest is greatly enhanced by the appearance of two old-fashioned young lovers in the quaint
                    costumes and manners of by-gone days. During this scene "An Old Fashioned Garden" was sung by Mr.
                    Joseph Ellett.</p>
            <pb n="469" id="VAA4025-020-4-123"/>
            <p>The views along Sugar creek, Big and Little Raccoon, Mill creek and other streams of the county are
                    beyond my descriptive powers.</p>

            <p>This pictured production of biography, history, natural scenery, agriculture and industries consists
                    as was said, of about 12,000 feet of film, in 12 reels. Captain Harris’ dedicatory lines,

            <p>A fine community spirit prevailed and made this vast undertaking possible. Perhaps special mention
                    should be made of the active and enthusiastic assistance of the county superintendent of schools, J.
                    H. Jollief, and the county agricultural agent, J. R. Meeks, for their invaluable work throughout the
                    county.</p>

                    </placeName> Day, 1924. The work of preparing and putting on both the pageant and the film has
                    already produced a marked quickening of interest in local history. It has been well said, that:
                    "A people who takes no pride in the achievements of remote ancestors, will never achieve
                    anything worthy to be remembered by remote descendants." This cannot be said of Parke
                    county.</p>
            <p>As the production is shown from time to time with additions as the years come and go who can predict
                    what the results may be in creating an ever increasing respect and love for our country, our state
                    and our county, because under our government-`of the people, for the people, by the
                    people’ -such things are possible.</p>

            <p>About ten years ago Mr. Iglehart became interested in the history of southwestern Indiana. A casual
                    survey impressed him with the idea that his community had contributed a number of worthy characters
                    to the country. An examination of the historical literature dealing with the section left with him
                    the impression that a great part of it was inaccurate and still more was partial. A half century in
                    the practice of law had equipped him well for the task of weighing evidence.</p>
            <p>Judge Iglehart's first contribution was an eighty-page article in Volume XVII of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> on Methodism in Southwestern Indiana. This was a
                    scholarly article and was widely appreciated.</p>

            <p>The story opens with the settlement in Hingham, Mass., in 1637, of Samuel Lincoln, the
                    great-great-great-great grandfather of Abraham Lincoln. He was a weaver by trade, although in these
                    early times it was necessary for men to know a little of all trades in order to cope with the
                    dangers and hardships that were present in the infant colony. Mordecai Lincoln, the son of Samuel,
                    chose as his trade black-smithing and moved across the bay to Hull and later to Cohas-set an
                    outgrowth of Hingham. From <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> the story takes us into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> where Mordecai II with his brother Abraham settled in Monmouth county. They soon began
                    to acquire property both in Monmouth and Middlesex counties. In 1730 Mordecai II bought some 300
                    acres of land in Berks county, <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> where Abraham Lincoln, the son of John, came to live in 1782 with his wife, Bathsheba,
                    and four children-Mordecai, Josiah, Mary, and Thomas. The exact boundaries of Abraham's
                    land is not known, although it is known that he owned much land along Green river. While clearing
                    his land one day he was shot by an Indian. In 1793 Bathsheba died and Thomas Lincoln, about whom we
                    are most interested, then spent most of his time with his brother Mordecai who was living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> county. He soon bought some land about 12 miles from Elizabethtown. In 1806 he <pb n="472" id="VAA4025-020-4-126"/> was married to Nancy Hanks and went to live at Elizabeth-town.
                    However, Abraham Lincoln was born on a farm near Hodgenville, where the family had gone to live.
                    Another move took them into Knob Creek valley and some few years later to the free soil of southern
                    Indiana near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was here that the mother of Abraham Lincoln died. Eleven years later we find the

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, where Abraham started out for himself. The rest of the book is filled with the long,
                    hard struggle through which Abraham Lincoln passed before his final success, a plain, honest, hard
                    working man meeting and solving the battles of life with unflinching courage. We know him as a
                    boatman, a store-keeper, a student of law, an orator, a member of the legislature, a debator.
                    Everywhere he made friends and kept them. His life of course was not without romance. One of the
                    greatest tragedies of his life was the death of his sweetheart, Ann Rutledge. He was married to Mary
                    Todd in 1842 and settled down in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From then on his life was that of a politician. His staunch stand against slavery, his
                    public speeches, his successful debates against Douglas brought him to the front and made him one of
                    the most prominent men in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. His fame soon spread until Abraham Lincoln was known over the whole country. In 1847
                    he began his first term in congress, after which in 1849 he went back to his law practice. The next
                    ten years of his life were given to successful public work, to the work of "educating <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>" to the existing conditions of the times. In 1860 he was the successful
                    candidate for the Presidency. Here the book leaves him.</p>
            <p>Ida M. Tarbell is one of the well known Lincoln writers. Some of her other books on this subject are
                    "He Knew Lincoln," "Life of Abraham Lincoln," "In
                    Lincoln's Chair." Her material is selected first hand, having made a
                    "pilgrimage" in 1922 for the purpose of collecting material for her work and for
                    correction of former material. More than one former tradition is broken down. She succeeds in
                    clearing up many vague and wrong impressions of the Lincolns. In no instance does she make a
                    correction which is not backed by sufficient evidence. Her book is written in a clear, readable
                    style.</p>

                    editorial explanations in the form of footnotes are given. How much this will mean in the distant
                    future cannot be estimated now. It is a beautiful volume on good paper and substantially bound.</p>

            <p>In this pamphlet Mr. Wilson has added another to his list of Indiana biographies. Those who have read

                    has done on Judge Lockhart. This biography was prepared for and read to the Southwestern Indiana
                    Historical Society, February 28, 1923. Judge Lock-hart was one of the most prominent citizens of
                    early Evans-ville, born in <placeName>

                    </placeName> 1857. His death was due to consumption brought on perhaps by over-work <pb n="475" id="VAA4025-020-4-129"/> and exposure in early political campaigns. Indiana has lost a number of
                    very promising men-Dunn, Bigger, Wright, Willard-in a similar man. Lockhart was well-known for his
                    work as a lawyer, judge, congressman and constitution maker. Mr. Wilson has done his work
                    thoroughly, adding a few selections from speeches delivered by Mr. Lockhart.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, was the rendezvous of the characters, who struck terror to the hearts of the pioneers
                    during the latter part of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries. Here have been
                    enacted some of the bloodiest and foulest deeds of the period. The cave, situated as it is, enabled
                    its tenants to prey upon the boats navigating both rivers, and also to waylay and rob the boatman
                    returning over the old trace. The Harpes, those peculiar and terrible arch-criminals, used it as a
                    base while perpetrating their outrages. Here, too, were made many crisp, new bills which passed for
                    legal tender on the frontier, where there was no standard money. The cave was also the hiding place
                    of the Masons with whom Little Harpe later sought refuge. This band stole money for the sake of
                    stealing and killed only when necessary. Many an immigrant has been robbed of his possessions by the
                    outlaws of Cave-in-Rock, and left to make his fortune again in the West, or perhaps was never heard
                    of again.</p>
            <p>The cave was one of the beauty spots along the river, and was visited by many famous travelers. Among
                    these were Victor Collot, Andrew Ellicott, Christian Shultz, and the naturalist Audubon, who have
                    left some mention of the fact in their writings.</p>
            <p>It was not only a den of outlaws, but sometimes was used as shelter for the families, moving into the
                    northwest, while new homes were built. At other times it was used as a place of religious worship,
                    as was proved by the finding of a small statue near the cave in 1918.</p>

            <p>After reading the second volume with considerable care one retains his high opinion of this scholarly
                    piece of work. It follows in good order the first volume, givng a full account of the activities of
                    the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> during the days of early statehood, of the loyal support of the union during the Civil
                    war, something of the troubles at home with the Indians during this formative period, and an
                    interesting account of the first railroad of the state. Throughout the book the author keeps in
                    close touch with the people and gives the reader vivid pictures of the struggles of the early
                    pioneers of that state.</p>
            <p>The volume has received some adverse criticism on the ground of perspective. Such criticism is not
                    merited. A historian is bound by the facts of his investigation. The Indian wars monopolized the
                    attention of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> for three or four years and a history failing to leave this impression would be less
                    than truthful. In my judgment there is nothing better in the two volumes than the author's
                    account of these Indian troubles. The footnotes and bibliographical work maintains its former high
                    level. It is to be hoped the author will preserve
                    <pb n="478" id="VAA4025-020-4-132"/> his critical attitude down through the period when

            <p>This volume is the twelfth of the Indiana Historical <hi rend="i">Collections</hi> and the third in
                    the series of Governor's Messages and Letters. It includes the messages and other official
                    papers o fthe three governors who served the state of Indiana from 1816 to 1825. It also presents a
                    number of speeches and letters of Governor Hendricks from the periods preceding and following his
                    term as governor. Very little of the correspondence of Governor Jennings has been discovered. In the
                    case of Governor Boon, simply his message of December 2, 1922, is included. In fact, this was his
                    only message, since he acted as governor for a few weeks only following the resignation of Governor
                    Jennings near the close of his second term.</p>
            <p>Doctor Esarey furnishes an introduction of twenty-five pages dealing in an interesting and
                    instructive manner with the political history of the territory and state from 1800 to 1825. In
                    addition, he presents brief biographical sketches of each of the three governors. He adheres to his
                    policy, followed in the preparation of the two preceding volumes in the series, of avoiding as far
                    as possible the use of footnotes and other editorial detail. Perhaps he is too modest in this
                    regard. The volume is well-printed, well-bound, and attractive. It gives pleasure to all who are
                    interested in the history of Indiana and the Middle West, to see these volumes come from the press.
                    The people of the state and the members of the General Assembly should be proud of the opportunity
                    to continue their support of the Indiana Historical Commission in the good work of publishing the
                    sources of the State's history.</p>
