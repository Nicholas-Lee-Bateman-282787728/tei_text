                    anniversary of the first meeting of its Board of Trustees. The school's Act of
                    Incorporation represented one of the first realizations in the Old Northwest of the ideal expressed
                    in that part of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 which had promised that "schools and the

            <p>An organized attempt to secure "the means of education" for Indiana Territory was

                    advocates of a "seminary of learning" now turned to the territorial legislature
                    for incorporation and recognition as legal custodians of the land grant. Both objectives were
                    achieved in "AN ACT to Incorporate an University in the Indiana Territory"<hi rend="sup">7</hi> which was approved by Governor Harrison on November 29, 1806. The law
                    specified that the school "be called and known by the name, or style of the <placeName>

                    as its Board of Trustees. The body of the law invests the Board of Trustees with the powers of suing
                    and being sued, selling and leasing the "seminary lands," filling vacancies,
                    making bylaws, and drawing up "ordinances for the government and discipline" of
                    the school. The act also comprises a summary of early nineteenth century educational philosophy,
                    curriculum planning, and administrative procedure for higher education.</p>
            <p>The educational philosophy embodied in this act of 1806 is couched in Jeffersonian terms; the
                    preamble states simply and clearly the case for a liberal education: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            affording relief under the pressure of misfortune, and hope and consolation in the hour of
                            death, And considering that in a commonwealth, where the humblest citizen may be elected to
                            the highest public office, and where the Heaven born prerogative of the right to elect, and
                            to reject, is retained, and secured to the citizens, the knowledge which is requisite for a
                            magistrate and elector, should be widely diffused.</p>

            <p>Taken altogether the fifteen articles of the act reveal several details of frontier social and
                    intellectual history. The university was to "provide for the instruction of youth in the
                    Latin, Greek, French and English languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Antient [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] and Modern History, Moral Philosophy, Logic, Rhetoric and the Law of Nature and
                    Nations. â€¦" No "particular tenets of religion shall be taught
                    â€¦ by the president and professors. â€¦" It was hoped that "the
                    establishment of an institution of this kind in the neighborhood of the aborigines of the country,
                    may tend to the gradual civilization of the rising generation, and if properly conducted be of
                    essential service to themselves, and contribute greatly to the cause of humanity and brotherly love
                    which all men ought to bear to each other of whatever colour. â€¦" Moreover, the
                    Indian children who were "sent to the said university for education" were to be
                    "maintained, clothed, and educated at the expense of the said institution.
                    â€¦"</p>
            <p>Students and professors were to be "exempt from militia duty," the trustees were to
                    "establish an institution for the education of females" when funds were available,
                    and a "Grammar school â€¦ for the purpose of teaching the rudiments of the
                    languages" was to supplement the university offerings.</p>
            <p>A final article empowered the Board of Trustees to conduct a lottery "to raise a sum not
                    exceeding twenty thousand dollars," a project which was quickly undertaken but which soon
                    proved unsuccessful.</p>
            <p>Less than two weeks after the passage of this Act of Incorporation, seventeen of the twenty-three men
                    named by <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-054-4-009"/> it as trustees met in the territorial
                    secretary's office on December 6, 1806. These men, as the footnote sketches of them which
                    follow suggest, were the political and social leaders of the area, and in their roles as political
                    leaders they were not infrequently bitter, implacable adversaries. Within the group were <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> men and anti-<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> men, pro-slavery and anti-slavery men, alleged Federalists and Republicans, territorial
                    divisionists and those who supported territorial unity. It was not to be expected, perhaps, that the
                    effect of such rivalries and animosities would be entirely absent in the proceedings of the Board.</p>
            <p>The minutes of the Board's meetings describe in detail the problems confronting men who
                    would build "a seminary of learning" on the frontier in the early nineteenth
                    century. The variety and complexity of these problems make it difficult to summarize them
                    adequately. There were, for example, problems of finance: at what prices should the
                    "seminary land" be sold; under what conditions might it be leased; how much should
                    be paid for the "site of the university" and where should it be located; how could
                    the greatest profit be realized from the lottery; what price should be paid for labor and materials
                    for the buildings; what kind of buildings were needed; how might additional aid from the federal
                    government be obtained; what tuition fees could be charged; what salaries should teachers receive;
                    what compensation should the clerk and treasurer of the Board receive; and what would be the annual
                    expense of running the school.</p>
            <p>There were also various problems of administrative procedure and of the duties and responsibilities
                    of the teachers: what rules should the Board follow in order to "transact its business with
                    due Order and decorum"; what powers were to be delegated to the president of the
                    university; what was to be the president's relationship with the faculty; what
                    "academic and moral discipline" should the teachers be expected to enforce. And
                    finally, there were problems related to curriculum planning and basic educational doctrine: was
                    there justification for offering the French language; what were "the most needful
                    subjects" to be offered; how long should the school terms last and how many vacations
                    should there be; how often should the Board of Trustees "examine the scholars";
                    what benefit might parents reasonably expect their children to derive from attendance; and what did
                    the <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-054-4-010"/> Board members believe were the justifications and rewards
                    of education.</p>
            <p>The Board's first steps in the direction of "solving" such problems were
                    recorded in the Minutes which follow, covering the period from December 6, 1806, through September
                    12, 1807. The attempted solutions were not always unanimously agreed upon, and they were frequently
                    not successfulâ€”as the Minutes make abundantly clear. It is possible, however, that
                    today's readers will find the failures as interesting as the successes, and that the total
                    record will have some value as a chapter in the story of frontier culture.</p>
            <p>The minutes of the Board of Trustees from December 6, 1806, to April 13, 1811, were recorded in two
                    small notebooks, which are marked "Book A" and "Book B" and are
                    preserved in the office of the president of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. At the meeting of April 13, 1811, the Board authorized the clerk to
                    purchase a new journal in which all the previous meetings' minutes were to be transcribed
                    as well, of course, as all those taken down thereafter. The present transcription has been made from
                    the minutes book dating from 1811 which is also preserved at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University.</p>
            <p>In editing these Minutes original spelling has been retained and, in general, original punctuation.
                    Periods have been inserted, however, after initials of persons and abbreviations; they have also
                    been used at the ends of paragraphs and in a few other places where their addition was unmistakably
                    indicated. No commas were added except to separate a series of nouns or names. Unclosed quotation
                    marks were left as they were in the original, but the abbreviations "A.M." and
                    "P.M." were standardized by uniform use of capital letters and periods.
                    Inconsistent and unusual spacing used in the original Minutes sometimes dictated modification of
                    paragraphing for the sake of clarity and uniformity. Space limitations prompted the listing of
                    members present at each Board meeting in a series, rather than in the columns which usually appeared
                    in the original.</p>
            <p>The preparation of these Minutes for publication has been a cooperative enterprise from the outset.
                    Professor Donald F. Carmony, of Indiana University and Editor of the Indiana Magazine of History,
                    first suggested the possibility of such publication. Numerous suggestions and much help have been
                    received from him and from Mary Lou Thielking, <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-054-4-011"/> Assistant
                    Editor. Dr. Isaac K. Beckes, President, and Judge Curtis G. Shake, Chairman of the Board of
                    Trustees, of <placeName>

                    </placeName> University granted permission to publish the material and have cooperated in many ways
                    in furthering the project. Mrs. Florence T. Watts, currently a member of the Board of Trustees,
                    generously shared her knowledge of early <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> history in general and of the university in particular. A grant from the Graduate
                    School of Indiana University helped to pay the expense of photostating some of the material. I
                    cannot overstate my debt to all of these people and to my wife, who typed and helped read proof on
                    the entire transcription.</p>

                    school immediately that his proposals would be accepted upon Terms that would meet his approbation.
                    But as the Board are extremely desirous that the opening of the school should not be unnecessarily
                    procrastinated they cannot at this time engage him. But from their opinion of his Qualifications as
                    above expressed they are persuaded that if no other person is employed previously to the time which
                    the Doctor has fixed for returning to this Country there is every probability that his services will
                    be accepted.</p>

                    be necessary for the establishment &amp; yearly support of a school which should embrace the
                    teaching of the English language, the rudiments of the Latin language, the French language, History,
                        <pb n="352" id="VAA4025-054-4-048"/> Geography, and the mathematics and also the sum which could
                    probably be raised from scholars that might be sent to the said school.</p>
            <p>Report: That they have had the said subject under consideration and have agreed that teaching the
                    English language, the rudiments of the Latin language, History, Geography, and the mathematics might
                    be had for five hundred Dollars per year. The concomitant expenses per year, stove, benches, and
                    tables at one hundred Dollars and the repairs of the house during the current year at ten Dollars
                    would make the costs of the establishments for teaching the above branches of learning amount to
                    seven hundred and ten Dollars, but as the stove, benches, and tables would remain on hand at the
                    expiration of the year and very little injured and would answer for the use of a school the
                    succeeding year, It would be proper to deduct as the price of those articles the sum of seventy
                    Dollars which could make the neat [net] expence of the said establishment for one year six hundred
                    and forty Dollars.</p>
            <p>In regard of the French language, your Committee are of opinion that it might be taught for three
                    hundred and fifty Dollars per year and that the contingent expences would be embraced in the above

            <p>In these it was proposed that any one who subscribed for a scholar to be taught the English language,

            <p>That the Legislature of Indiana Territory in the year 1806 passed an Act incorporating an University
                    in the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> styled the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University and in the same act your Petitioners were authorized to dispose of a small
                    part of the Township of land appropriated by an Act of Congress (for the use and support of a public
                    school in the said District) for the purpose of erecting the necessary buildings for said
                    institution and your Petitioners being convinced that an enlightened and virtuous people is the only
                    depository of public liberty and wishing to carry the said institution into immediate effect but not
                    being in possession of any funds which will at this time yield an annual income whereby your
                    Petitioners would be enabled to establish the said institution on a liberal plan so as to be reached
                    by all classes of citizens without encroaching on the Capital of said institution which your
                    Petitioners conceive was only placed in their hands to make use of the profits thereof and the said
                    Township of land being the only capital which they possess and being situate in a new Country and
                    unimproved; where land is cheap and therefore will not lease to advantage it will of course yield no
                    annual profit, probably for fifteen or twenty years during which time the citizens of the Territory
                    will be subject to the inroads of ignorance, superstition, and faction which are inevitable
                    consequences of the want of the benign influence of education and the liberal
                    sciencesâ€”Your Petitioners seeing that our excellent Government (which was purchased at
                    the expence of the lives of thousands of brave men) is liable to be assailed by the various arts of
                    cunning and intrigue of designing, ambitious and desperate individuals, and also subject to the
                    attacks of the silly and often deadly arts of foreign Politics, your Petitioners therefore being
                    convinced <pb n="357" id="VAA4025-054-4-053"/> that the only safeguard and secure shield against the
                    dark cunning of individuals and of foreign Governments is the blaze of science which will reach the
                    mind of the plowboy as well as the most wealthy citizen and wishing to secure to the Citizen
                    domestic happiness and stamp the principles of our Government upon their plastic minds, but not
                    having the means to apply the remedy with a strong and steady hand we therefore pray that you may
                    pass a law levying a small tax on Salt made at public works in this Territory and also lay a tax on
                    Indian traders for the use of said institution untill the other institutions to which Congress hath
                    granted Donations of land in this Territory are organized then to give said institutions a
                    proportion of said taxâ€”Your Petitioners likewise pray that you may grant them the Commons

            <p>Judge Taylor in behalf of the Managers of the Lottery scheme Reported:</p>

                    money to aid in erecting and endowing a University at this place beg leave to report to the Board
                    that they have caused to be printed the number of Tickets necessary to raise the sum at present
                    contemplated; they have likewis[el caused to be printed forty copies of the scheme for the purpose
                    of diffusing information of it [as] extensively as possible for which and printing the tickets they
                    have paid Mr. Stout<hi rend="sup">65</hi> the sum of fifty Dollars out of the money collected from
                    the members of the Board and from others who subscribed to defray the expenses necessarily incurred
                    to put the scheme in operation. The printers receipt for the money paid him and the report of the
                    Chairman appointed to collect the money subscribed will shew the situation of the funds in the hands
                    of the managers.</p>
            <p>The managers beg leave further to report that they have issued and deposited in the hands of
                    different persons in the States of <placeName>

                    respective receipts numbered from one to twelve and which are now handed in as part of this report.</p>
            <p>It is with considerable regret that the managers feel themselves constrained to declare that in their
                    opinion there is not the smallest probability of ever raising the sum contemplated or in fact of
                    raising a sum of any importance by a lottery.</p>

            <head>The Story of the West Baden Springs Hotel</head>
            <byline>John W. O'Malley, S. J.<hi rend="sup">*</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>"The Eighth Wonder of the World"â€”that was the phrase which drew
                    thousands of guests to the West Baden Springs Hotel in southern Indiana during the early decades of
                    the twentieth century. The hotel may not have justified this extravagant claim to fame, but it was
                    indeed an unusual building. Its unique circular structure displayed the world's widest
                    unsupported dome, two hundred feet in diameter, surpassing in breadth the majestic St.
                    Peter's Cathedral in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> on which it supposedly was modeled. Even today visitors to West Baden College, now
                    housed in the former hotel building, marvel at the strength and beauty of the dome of this colossal
                    "roundhouse."</p>
            <p>The history of the hotel-college is as interesting as the building itself. It mirrors trends in
                    American social history and touches the larger stories of George Rogers Clark, Thomas J. Taggart,
                    "Scarface Al" Capone, and the Hagenbeck-Wallace circus, whose lions, tigers, and
                    elephants performed upon the hotel's beautiful marble mosaic floor. The hotel's
                    transformation into a seminary in 1934 seems to have added finality to its history. At that time the
                    spacious dining room was changed into an austere monastic refectory, the lobby was transfigured into
                    the seminary chapel, and the band shell under the dome of the Pompeian Court was replaced by a
                    life-sized figure of the Savior.</p>
            <p>In 1783 the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> made the area which included what is now Indiana a part of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The young American nation, however, soon faced serious problems in this frontier land,
                    especially in and around the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> settlement. Besides ineffectual local government and friction between the French
                    settlers and incoming Americans, there simmered the explosive mixture of whiskey and Indian
                    temperament. By August, 1786, Indians of the Old Northwest were threatening to go on the warpath,
                    and American lives and property were unsafe. When the Congress of the Confederation failed to take
                    strong measures to halt the trouble, the <placeName>

                    expedition directed against these Indian uprisings. This force of nearly one thousand men met in the
                    summer of 1786 at the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    search for water and salt when they came east from the western prairies during the late spring or
                    early summer. The sulphur springs in the West Baden area, later to be important in the growth of the
                    West Baden Springs Hotel, seem to have drawn as many as five hundred buffalo during the summer
                    months. This trace, already cut through the wilderness and therefore easy to follow, became a
                    natural overland route to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> as that settlement began to attract Americans. The good hunting usually to be found at
                    the "licks" was another reason for following the trail. It was natural, then, for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>
                    </placeName> to choose it for his expedition. On his way overland he camped at French Lick, less
                    than a mile from the future site of the West Baden Springs Hotel, and thus his expedition, by the
                    hand of Captain Bernard Gaines, gave us the first authoritative record of the white man's
                    presence in that vicinity.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    gave attention to the salt crusts left by the springs in the West Baden area. The Enabling Act of
                    1816 granted to the state a maximum of thirty-six sections of land for saline reserves, to be
                    controlled by the state legislature and not to be leased for any period longer than <list type="footnotes">

                    springs was selected for a reserve.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The early lawmakers hoped that the saline reserves would be a plentiful source of salt for the
                    settlers, but their hopes were in vain. In less than two years after the reserves had been set up,
                    even the governor realized that they would be of no value in the manufacture of salt and he promptly
                    suggested their sale to the general public.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In 1833 Doctor William A. Bowles
                    bought the saline lands. A native Marylander, Bowles had moved to Indiana and later implicated
                    himself with the Knights of the Golden Circle and became with Milligan one of the defendants in the
                    famous <hi rend="i">ex parte Milligan</hi> decision of the <placeName>

                    waters might be of some use as medicine. At any rate, in 1845 he founded the first hotel in the
                    springs area, a hotel which eventually blossomed into the fabulous French Lick Springs Hotel of
                    Democratic boss Thomas J. Taggart and which is today the French Lick-Sheraton Hotel.</p>
            <p>On May 13, 1846, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> declared war on Mexico. Three days later the Secretary of War called upon the governor
                    of Indiana to furnish three regiments of volunteers. Among the many to respond was William A.
                    Bowles, who promptly was elected a colonel by the Indiana men gathered at Camp Clark.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> It was probably at this time that Bowles leased the French Lick House and its property
                    to John A. Lane, a traveling salesman of patent medicines.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lane prospered during the years he held the French Lick House and probably enjoyed the security of an
                    existence more stable than that of an itinerant salesman. As his lease ran <list type="footnotes">

                    north of French Lick House as soon as possible. It was probably in 1855 that Lane's Mile
                    Lick Inn opened its doors for the first time.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Located on lower ground than
                    French Lick House, it occupied a less desirable site. Lane, however, went to work with vigor and,
                    inspired by his success at French Lick, set out to make Mile Lick just as successful. In addition to
                    his original capital he borrowed $1,800, built a sawmill, and from its lumber constructed
                    his frame hotel and a bridge across French Lick Creek.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Later Lane changed the
                    hotel's name to "The West Baden Inn." This change, he felt, would make
                    the inn more attractive to guests and at the same time disassociate it from French Lick House.</p>
            <p>By 1860 both inns were well established and were considered among the more prosperous mineral spring
                    resorts in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Lane and his successors continued to spend money improving
                    the West Baden Springs Hotel, as it was known by this time. During these early years the hotel was
                    open only during the summer months, the "watering season," and drew its guests
                    almost exclusively from the southern Indiana region.</p>
            <p>A turning point in the story of the West Baden Springs Hotel came on April 1, 1887, when the

                    soon as the present season closes. â€¦ A building boom has struck this place."16</p>
            <p>The railroad brought many new guests to the West Baden Springs Hotel, but none of greater importance

                    into an American resort in less than a decade. Local residents were surprised when it was announced
                    in February, 1888, that Sinclair had bought one-third interest in the West Baden Springs Company for
                    $28,000. Before the summer season was over Sinclair bought another third interest in the

                            bought the paper and put W. J. Prow in charge as editor. The paper was a success as

                    a safe dome of such great diameter which would be able to stand the effects of expansion and

                            that the building is patterned after any historical structure. The original blueprints in
                            the West Baden College files indicate that the basic design is Sinclair's. The
                            persistent legend, however, is that Sinclair conceived the structure as a combination of the
                            lines of the Roman Colosseum and Saint Peter's Cathedral dome. Haupt,
                            "French Lick Springs Hotel," 103, cites Raymond P. Stout, late president
                            of. the Paoli State Bank and friend of Sinclair's, as maintaining that Sinclair got
                            the idea during a trip to Europe before the fire. Mr. Stout died in 1955 before the author
                            was able to check with him. Mr. William W. Cave, president of the French Lick State Bank,
                            life-long resident of French Lick, and business acquaintance of Sinclair's
                            indicated his acceptance of this explanation in an interview on June 30, 1955. Others also
                            have accepted it, but no conclusive proof is available.</item>

                    water from these marvelous springs "cured or helped cure" over fifty ailments,

            <p>Under Ballard's management the hotel attracted more conventions and used gambling more
                    extensively as a come-on for guests. One spectacular attraction was added to the West Baden Springs
                    Hotel during these yearsâ€”circus performances in the Pompeian Court. At the west entrance
                    was erected a regular size circus ring and, inside it, a cage with a protective top. Lions, tigers,
                    and even elephants were brought into the Court and made to perform for the amusement of the hotel
                        guests.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> After the performance, the ring and cage would be torn down and
                    the Court set up for a convention banquet to seat one thousand to fifteen hundred diners. In the
                    twenties business boomed, and so did the West Baden Springs Hotel. (See insert facing page 326.)</p>
            <p>Then Wall Street crashed, and with it crashed the little world that was the West Baden Springs Hotel.
                    The ticker tape of Logan and Bryan, brokers, brought the incredible news to a shocked and despairing
                    group of men who crowded into the little room just inside the "Springs Entrance."
                    The telephone exchange outside the lobby brought confirmation of the news. It was true. The market
                    had crashed.</p>
            <p>Within hours guests began to check out, determined to get home and there, perhaps, find some measure
                    of security against the utter destitution which threatened them. The trickle of departing guests
                    swelled into something of a torrent as the panic spread. For a few days the lobby of the West Baden
                    Springs Hotel was feverish with the rush. For a few days the bell boys, room clerks, and cabbies
                    worked at top efficiency to keep up with check-outs and departures. Then it was quiet. In the midst
                    of the fall season the hotel was practically empty of guests as though its life-blood had been
                        drained.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

            <p>The fall season, ending with tremendous financial loss, stretched into winter. On January 1,1930, one
                    guest registered at the hotel; two registered the following day. The average number of guests for
                    December, 1930, was five. Fewer guests than ever registered for the spring of 1931. The summer was

            <p>Finally in the fall of 1931, the hotel closed its doors. This was the first time the management had
                    deliberately closed them since 1887, the year before the arrival of Sinclair. The hotel promised,
                    however, to reopen for the spring season of 1932 to care for a few previously scheduled conventions

                    no better than had been the two previous ones. In June, therefore, the manager of the hotel called
                    the heads of the various departments to his office, told them that the hotel was closing and that no
                    one knew when, if ever, it would open again. All beds and furniture were covered with newspapers,
                    the hotel silverware and dishes carefully stored away, and arrangements made to have the grounds
                    tended for an indefinite period of time. On June 30, 1932, the last payments were made to the cooks,
                    maids, florists, bell boysâ€”to that immense army of manpower which makes up a
                    hotelâ€”and the hotel auditor left that same day. On July 1, 1932, the executive office
                        closed.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

                    religious or educational purposes. The Reverend Hugo F. Sloctemyer, member of the Society of Jesus

            <p>When almost sixty years of age, Chanute became interested in Otto Lilienthal's experiments
                    with gliders. Lilienthal, a German, is regarded as the most important of the "modern
                    fathers" of aviation. Chanute collected and sifted every bit of information he could find
                    about aeronautical work done in Europe, even from the earliest times. The result was a volume, <hi rend="i">Progress in Flying Machines</hi>, published in 1894, which became one of the bibles of
                    aeronautics. This work was said to have been the first reasoned analysis of aviation experiments to
                    be published; it was symbolic of one of Chanute's chief functions in the history of flight,

            </p>
            <p>Having published his book, Chanute decided to experiment with gliders of his own design. His
                    immediate objective was not to perfect a machine that would fly farther than any other had flown not
                    to excel in any of the spectacular aspects of aviation. Instead, Chanute believed that of all the
                    problems involved in aeronautics the most important was equilibrium; for until automatic stability
                    at all angles of flight and conditions of wind was achieved, and safety therefore secured, it would
                    be premature to place a motor in a flying machine. Chanute was certain that lack of balance was the
                    chief weakness of Lilienthal's machines and that the German's success was due
                    largely to his superb physical and mental coordination. Lilienthal's death as a result of a
                    glider accident in 1896 strengthened Chanute's opinion that the problem of equilibrium must
                    be solved before men could fly with safety.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Lilienthal experimented with both monoplane and biplane gliders, the operational principles of
                    the two were fundamentally the same. The pilot "stood in the middle of the apparatus,
                    thrusting his arms through padded openings in the frame, so that the weight in flight rested on his
                    elbows." Thus he sailed through the air with a portion of his body and legs hanging below
                    the machine. He maintained balance while in flight by moving his body and swinging his legs back and
                    forth or from side to side as the occasion required. Lilienthal made his flights from hills, one of
                    which was artifically constructed, and from low mountains.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In 1896, aware of
                    the need for a better method of control, he installed a movable rudder on a biplane glider, the
                    apparatus being operated by a rope fastened to a band around the pilot's head. The plan
                    called for the machine to climb when the head was moved forward and to descend when it was moved
                    backward. While testing this device Lilienthal apparently became <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In contrast to Lilienthal, Chanute's objective was to discover better means of control than
                    that of shifting the weight of the pilot and also to obtain some measure of automatic stability. He
                    sought to achieve these ends with the use of adjustable surfaces and parts which could be controlled
                    with a minimum of effort on the part of the pilot. Because of the success of his efforts, Chanute
                    must be given credit for the development of the first reasonably stable flying machine.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chanute selected Miller Beach, in what is now the northeastern part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for his experiments because the high sand dunes there were reasonably devoid of
                    vegetation and because of the frequent north and northwest winds, which were best for glider flights
                    in that area. Moreover, the soft sand assured maximum safety for the operators of the machines.
                    Chanute also hoped, but mistakenly, that at Miller he would escape the attention of the newspapers
                    and curiosity seekers. His party, which arrived in Miller on June 22, 1896, consisted of Augustus M.
                    Herring, a pupil of Lilienthal who had been associated with Samuel P. Langley at the Smithsonian
                    Institution; Paul Butusov, a young Russian aeronautical enthusiast; William Avery, a carpenter; and
                    James Ricketts, a young <placeName>

                    fantastic stories were told in later years about the "Crazy Old Man of the Sand

                    A famous naturalist, when spending his boyhood summers in the sand hills, was impressed by the

                    for some distance. A few hundred feet to the north was another dune which ran east and west; beyond

                    interfered with his work. Instead, the party came on the sailing vessel,
                    "Scorpion," to Dune Park several miles east of Miller, where a site was selected

            <p>Chanute tested three types of machines at Dune Park: his original multiple-winged affair, a glider
                    with three wings, and a monoplane invented by Butusov. The design of the three-winged machine was
                    Chanute's, except for an automatic device perfected by Herring which was intended to secure
                        stability.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> All the machines were constructed at Chanute's
                    expense. Since Butusov's glider was too heavy for the operator to take off from a flying
                    start, a slanting trestle was erected. Its runways were greased with tallow and two men pulled the
                    machine into the wind. The glider never flew more than 75 feet and was soon abandoned as
                        unsatisfactory.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> The greatest distance achieved by the multiple-winged type
                    was 188 feet in 7.8 seconds with Avery as the operator.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>The first trials of the three-winged machine showed that the lower surface was too close to the

            <p>Chanute stands out most prominently as the man who directly encouraged the Wright brothers and
                    provided them with a practical example of biplane construction. In May, 1900, Wilbur Wright, who was
                    acquainted with Chanute's writings and accomplishments, wrote him the first of numerous
                    letters exchanged by the two during the next ten years. The Chanute-Wright correspondence is said to

                                    Herring in regard to the "Chanute type" of glider. Herring and his
                                    friends insisted that Chanute was not giving Herring sufficient credit for his part
                                    in the development of the machine. Although Chanute in his diary refers to the
                                    biplane tested at Dune Park as the "Herring machine," he also
                                    speaks of it in the same document as the glider Herring "called his
                                    own." On several occasions Chanute gave Herring full credit for the
                                    "automatic regulator" which operated the rudder. At one point of
                                    the controversy, Chanute declared that he "did not claim to have made any
                                    invention at all, but simply designs to study automatic stability." For

            <p>Had a nail not punctured the foot of a young man on August 12, 1905, the history of aviation might
                    have carried one other name to fame. On that date this young man was waiting to put the final
                    touches on an airplane of his own design and construction when he stepped on a nail. In five days
                    tetanus developed and in two more days he was dead.</p>
            <p>This is the story of Albert Ulysses Rupel who was born July 1, 1880, at Wall in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jay County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Wall is no longer on the map but at one time had two general stores, a
                    telegraph office, a saloon, and a post office. It was a community that had sprung up with the coming
                    of the oil wells and finally disappeared with them.</p>
            <p>Albert attended the local public school, graduated from the eighth grade and went on into high school
                    at Poling-the central point of the township. There were only two or three students in the high
                    school and it soon closed, leaving him no choice but to return to grade school to repeat his
                    studies. He did just that for a couple of school years.</p>
            <p>This was the time when the gas boom in Indiana was at its height. Flames from gas pipes of large
                    dimensions lighted the area at night and burned as beacons in the daytime, instilling every one
                    living in OT passing by the "field" with a desire to be a part of that great
                    adventure. The ambition of every young man in that area was to be a factor in producing oil, and a
                    prominent person in getting a well into production was the "driller." But to be a
                    driller one had to be a "tool dresser" first. The tool dresser was of lesser
                    importance than the driller since he was the official assistant in sharpening the drill bit. He
                    stood on one side of the bit swinging a sledge hammer while the driller swung from the opposite
                    side. This rythmic beating so sharpened the bit that it took considerable drilling to wear it down
                    before it would need resharpening.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">*</hi> Ernest Rupel, an <placeName>

                        </placeName> physician, is a brother of Albert Rupel. Although the Wright Brothers had made
                        their famous flight at Kitty Hawk late in 1903, Albert Rupel's efforts to build a
                        successful airplane, as well as Chanute's earlier experiments with gliders, suggest
                        that the time was at hand for the coming of the airplane in the early 1900's.</item>

            <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-054-4-088"/>
            <p>These and other mechanical operations caused interested persons to familiarize themselves with all
                    that had to do with the production of oil. Steam boilers, steam engines, gas engines, power units,
                    and the like, fascinated young Albert Rupel. One day in 1903, while repairing a gas engine, the
                    flywheel fell on his foot crushing it. This accident incapacitated him, and he immediately signed up
                    for a course in stationary engineering with the American Correspondence School.</p>
            <p>With natural gas plentiful in his area in 1902 and 1903, Albert made many small engines with
                    cylinders ranging from a hand bicycle pump to a two-inch piece of brass tubing. These motors were
                    all made on the principle of a one cycle type, using gas for pressure and allowing it to escape at
                    the end of the stroke. All bearings, pistons, crankshafts, flywheels were made by him using babbitt
                    for the metal; he also made his own patterns and molds. With the engines he furnished power for
                    running washing machines and churns that were originally designed for hand power but could be caused
                    to run indefinitely if not turned off.</p>
            <p>Then came the newspaper story of the flying machine. This intrigued him. Here was a new device that
                    offered possibilities. He had fashioned kites of various designs and then decided to build an
                    airplane.</p>
            <p>From hickory wood, selected for its strength and pliability, he fashioned long strips five-sixteenths
                    of an inch in thickness that were glued or wired to make a frame. Then by using similar strips, he
                    made what he called "ribs" which radiated from a central or focal point on either
                    side of the frame so that a wing spread of considerable proportion could be obtained when these
                    ribs, or wings, were covered with oilcloth. The tips of each wing were supported by small wires
                    running from an upright on the framework, thus holding the wings at an angle somewhat like those of
                    a soaring bird. A similar group of wires reached out from the base of the central frame to the tips
                    so that any lift of the wings would carry the central framework with it. The wing spread was eight
                    feet; each wing was four feet long.</p>
            <p>Extending backward, made of the same hickory, was a tail not unlike that of a pigeon's tail
                    spread in flight. The desired angle of lift was determined and the tail held in place by a brace to
                    the frame.</p>
            <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-054-4-089"/>
            <p>With a small wire stretching from the front of one wing to the other, and a similar wire holding the
                    back tips, the whole plane was fairly solid. In it Albert placed various objects, even as much as
                    two bricks weighing four pounds each. Using a long cord he tested his model by simply running and
                    pulling on the string. It sailed into the air, carrying its load, and settled down without accident.
                    Time after time these trial flights were made after varying the wing angle and tail upturn in an
                    effort to decide about what angles seemed most efficient.</p>
            <p>After satisfying himself that a machine could be made large enough to carry a person or persons and
                    to do all that the model had done, only proportionately more, Albert set out to make a real one.
                    Here the frame was constructed of angle iron, the ribs of cold-drawn seamless steel
                    tubingâ€” bicycle frame tubing made by the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby</region>
                    </placeName> Steel Tube Co. Instead of oilcloth for wing and tail covering, he used eight ounce duck
                    with tunneled sleeves, sewn on by the Jay Garment Co., <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and through which the smooth steel tubes easily slipped. A rudder placed on
                    top of the tail had similar construction.</p>
            <p>Beneath the frame there were four specially constructed wire wheels covered with pneumatic tires.
                    These wheels were fourteen inches in diameter, one placed at each corner of the frame. Rupel had two
                    propellers fashioned somewhat like an electric fan. He used four blades on each propeller. These
                    were bolted to a shaft of steel held by a casting. This casting was so constructed that the
                    propeller blades could be set at a desired pitch to give an optimum pull with available rotating
                    speed. The two propellers were placed one on either side up front on the solid steel shaft that ran
                    to a sprocket on the back. A chain from there could transmit the power from an engine beneath the
                    seat. (See insert facing page 327.)</p>
            <p>Where to get an engine was the next problem. There were only marine motors available so Albert
                    deferred that detail. He decided to make a trial flight by having the machine pulled by a hay rope
                    attached to an automobile.</p>
            <p>At the trial, when the car reached a moderate speed the plane lifted, but a gust of wind tipped a
                    wing so that the wheels on the opposite side were crushed. As a substitute, ordinary boards like
                    skis were used. Then the one cylinder Cadillac (or Buick) stalled without getting the plane off the
                        <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-054-4-090"/> ground. Horses just had to be used. A team of draft horses,
                    ridden at a gallop by Jim Hollingsworth, R. R. 3, Winchester, Indiana, pulled the rope and caused
                    the plane to soar as high as the tree tops. It settled to the ground without incident. Albert turned
                    it around and the plane soared back across the field. This was in October, 1904. Being satisfied
                    that his invention would work, he rested a bit to investigate engines that might be practical.</p>
            <p>To house this enormous flying machine with its 475 square feet of wing surface required that the
                    bracket to which the wing ribs were attached be rebored in a staggered pattern so that the wings
                    could be laid back to be more or less parallel, one with the other. Thus, the machine could be
                    pushed or drawn through a door and stored in the barn. This facility had been provided for and the
                    machine was laid aside for the winter.</p>
            <p>During the summer some of the details in construction were perfected, and early in August that year
                    Albert stepped on a nail that punctured his foot. From this puncture wound, tetanus developed and in
                    a week he was dead.</p>

                    history, Mr. Beers describes the history of the activities of American and Canadian institutions,
                    historians, and others who obtained reproductions of relevant documents from archives and manuscript
                    collections. The author is concerned primarily with compilations of public records, ecclesiastical
                    records, and private manuscripts which relate to the history of the region now included in the <placeName>

                    manuscripts falls outside the scope of the study, although such documents are mentioned

               <hi rend="i">The Negro in Indiana Before 1900.</hi> By Emma Lou Thornbrough. Indiana <hi rend="i">Historical Collections</hi>, Volume XXXVII. (<placeName>

            <p>This study of the Negro in Indiana before 1900 is a pioneering effort to depict his status in a
                    Northern state during the nineteenth century. It supplies a needed historical base for understanding
                    the situation of the Negro in the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>The volume is essentially divided into the two chronological periods of before 1860 and after 1865,
                    with an interlude chapter on the "Civil War Years." Chapters are devoted to the
                    legal, economic, and social patterns of Negro life in the two respective periods. Data are supplied
                    to the reader for a comparative analysis of these patterns as they exist for the enslaved Negroes,
                    the indentured servants, and the free persons of color before and after the Civil War.</p>

            <p>Many present-day Indiana citizens will be as "shocked" as was the <placeName>

                    Ordinance and the Constitution of the state" (p. 25), and that even after 1816 indentured
                    servants continued to be bought and sold within the state. As the author contends, the antislavery
                    sentiment in these years "stemmed more from a desire to preserve the soil of Indiana for
                    white men than from any humanitarian interest in black men" (p. viii). Nor did this desire
                    for white supremacy vanish after the Civil War. This thesis strongly reminds the reader of
                    "the theme of Southern history" as presented by Ulrich B. Phillips for the
                    Southern statesâ€”the determination to keep the South a white man's country.</p>
            <p>Possibly it is at this point that the reviewer begins to wonder whether this excellent and
                    well-documented study could have been presented in somewhat better perspective if it had been more
                    consciously and specifically placed in the setting of national history. Perchance this point could
                    be illustrated in terms of Chapter II, "Population Movements 1816-1860." Brief
                    reference is made at the beginning of the chapter to the transformation of Indiana from "a
                    pioneer wilderness into a flourishing agricultural state" and to the growth of the
                    population of the state during these ante-bellum years, but no analysis is given of the sources of
                    the white settlers. Discussion of population movement is practically confined to Negro migration.</p>
            <p>Repeatedly through the volume it is pointed out that both Negroes and practices of discriminations
                    against themâ€”practices intended to keep the Negro in "his
                    place"â€”were relatively concentrated in the southern counties of the state.
                    Geographical proximity to the South and consequent weight of numbers obviously would tend to magnify
                    the problem there, but the settlers in the area of the state lying south of the fortieth parallel
                    were disproportionately from the states of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Could it be that these migrants from the South (with such exceptions as the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> Quakers) carried their Southern mores and attitudes with them into Indiana? Comparably,
                    could the migrants emanating from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, Pennsylvania, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> have affected the climate of opinion of the area of the state lying north of the
                    fortieth parallel in terms of the mores and attitudes transferred from their sources of origin?</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the student of the subject can only be grateful for this highly informative monograph
                    and hope that other Northern states will emulate the author and the Indiana Historical Bureau in
                    making available an equally invaluable contribution toward a history of the embattled Negro in the
                    whole North during the years covered.</p>
            <p>Much patience, persistence, and research skill are manifest in ferreting out elusive, fugitive, and
                    fragmentary sources of the history of the Negro, whose own literary inarticulateness makes the task
                    of the historian infinitely more difficult. This fine product sponsored by the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau should challenge the writing members of local historical societies to lend a hand in the
                    utilization of their local resources on the subject.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Frontier in Perspective</hi> is the outgrowth of a series of lectures in honor of
                    Lyman Copeland Draper which were delivered in 1954 under the sponsorship of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Summer Session. One hundred years earlier Draper had become corresponding secretary,
                    without salary, of the State Historical Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. But Frederick Jackson Turner, not Draper, was expected to be the central personality
                    and common catalytic agent of these lectures which were given under the general title "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Reconsiders the Frontier." "In gathering these essays to form a
                    volume, the editors urged the authors to take the Turner thesis on the significance of the frontier
                    in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history as a reference point, to keep documentation to a minimum, and to accompany
                    their essays with selective reading lists rather than full bibliographies" (p. viii).</p>
            <p>This volume, however, like much of the writing about the Turner thesis does not adequately come to
                    grips with Turner's ideas. That the Turner thesis was a rather definite and fairly
                    persistent set of views and interpretations of the frontier in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> seems generally to have been one of the implicit assumptions of this volume. But how
                    could Turner's writing serve as a true reference point without explicitly and carefully
                    considering whether there had been a Turner thesis or Turner theses about the frontier in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>? Secondly, since Turner's ideas were to be a "reference
                    point," one naturally expects to find almost constant review and evaluation of his ideas in
                    this volume. To the contrary, however, some of the essays hardly mention Turner, while few of them
                    show visible signs of careful wrestling with and thoughtful reflection upon Turner's views
                    and interpretations as a whole.</p>
            <p>Part I of this book includes seven essays under the general title of "The World
                    Frontier." Professor Paul L. MacKendrick obviously labors to find comparisons and contrasts
                    between frontier life in the ancient Roman Empire and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. But our understanding of Cato is perhaps confused rather than increased by his
                    description of Cato as "a stern <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName>," as one who assumed "a hillbilly pose," etc. The reader is
                    further confused when men such as Cato, Marius, and Cicero are offered as samples of "the
                    Lincolns and the Jacksons of the ancient world" (p. 12). Professor Walter Prescott
                    Webb's "The Western World Frontier" has infinitely more of Webb than of
                    Turner in it and, though it offers much historical and philosophical food worthy of careful thought,
                    it perhaps outdoes Toynbee in offering keys and generalizations about human experience! Professor A.
                    L. Burt, in raising the question of what might have happened had Turner examined the history of
                    Canada, Australia, and New Zealand when he wrote about the significance of the frontier, exhibits
                    substantial understanding of Turner and adds evidence in support of much that Turner wrote.</p>
            <p>Part II adds six essays under the overall title of "The American Frontier."
                    Professor Thomas Perkins Abernethy gives snapshots of various southern frontiers, but again Turner
                    remains largely in the <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-054-4-094"/> background. Professor Paul W. Gates
                    perhaps correctly believes that Turner overemphasized the role of small farmers on the frontier and
                    underestimated the roles of farm laborers, farm tenants, land speculators, etc Gates also charges
                    that such eminent historians as Paxson, Riegel, Billington, and Shafer have made similar errors. But
                    his presentation of this alternative view is much weakened by his heavy use of documentation drawn
                    from the post-frontier era. Professor Walter A. Agard offers valuable evidence of the impact of the
                    "Classics of the Midwest Frontier," but he quotes Turner somewhat out of context
                    with regard to the impact of classical learning. In addition, he distorts Turner's views by
                    associating them inappropriately with some Fourth of July oratory suggesting that the Midwestern
                    frontier had "literally nothing to do" with the past of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Greece (p. 166). Fortunately, however, his essay as a whole tends to correct the
                    one sided picture of Turner drawn in its two opening paragraphs. Professor Henry Nash Smith writes
                    of Mark Twain as an interpreter of the Far West, but by the time he plows through his literary and
                    structural analysis of <hi rend="i">Roughing It</hi> this reviewer, and apparently Smith as well,
                    finds it difficult to relate the essay to Turner "as a reference point." Professor
                    A. Irving Hallowell has a thoughtful and interesting essay on the impact of the Indian on American
                    life.</p>
            <p>It was a legitimate endeavor for these essays to inquire about the possible relevance of
                    Turner's views and interpretations to other countries and civilizations in varying periods
                    of time. But if Turner was to be "a reference point," then more effort than is
                    indicated in most of these essays should have been given in an attempt to present more clearly
                    Turner's views and interpretations in the context of the American frontier. Interesting as
                    most of these essays are, still most of them are less penetrating and significant than they might
                    have beenâ€”for like much of the writing by both critics and defenders of Turner and the
                    Turner thesisâ€”they generally fail to come adequately to grips with what Turner himself
                    wrote and what he himself thought about the impact of the frontier on American life and
                    institutions.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> in relation to <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> archaeology. The volume is a
                    technical accounting of several years' work on the part of several individuals with the
                    results ably drawn together by McGregor.</p>
            <p>The problem is outlined in the Introduction wherein it is explained why the Pool and Irving villages
                    were chosen for detailed study, and justification of this selection is apparent from the detailed
                    and descriptive text which follows. The orthodox manner of presentation has been <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-054-4-095"/> avoided through omission of a detailed, and possibly boring, account of
                    the actual excavations. But from maps, plans, and halftone illustrations it is obvious that the work
                    was methodical. The manner of designating test areas excavated at the two sites is a bit laborious
                    but generally acceptable.</p>
            <p>Of special interest is the evidence of structures and/or dwellings found at both sites. Entirely too
                    little is known of this facet of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> life. These additions to available information are, therefore, monumental. Not a bit
                    less important was the finding of charred corn in unquestioned association with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> debris. Those who have viewed the major earthworks of these folk have invariably been
                    impressed by the magnitude of labor and time involved in their construction. Such projects surely
                    must have involved at least a semi-sedentary people with an economy based in part upon some
                    agricultural activity. Also, there have been "reports" of corn from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> sites, and stone and shell hoes which have been found also implied agricultural
                    activity. But now the discovery of corn under controlled conditions by a competent observer lays to
                    rest all inferences and implications.</p>
            <p>Diligent effort was made by McGregor to exhaust the potential of material he had recovered by
                    excavation and reconnaissance. Specialists in several fields were called upon to identify the flora
                    and fauna thus derived. Especially interesting and valuable are the studies of corn by Dr. Hugh C.
                    Cutler and of fresh water shells by Professor Max R. Matteson.</p>
            <p>The entire undertaking is neatly summarized in one chapter clearly defined under the heading
                    "Hypotheses." In this section several questions are posed, then answers are
                    presented by stating a "theory" with supporting "evidence." At
                    no point is there dogmatism; to the contrary, there is displayed a realistic view of the situation
                    as regards what is now known about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName>. And, briefly, this reviewer found favor with the manner in which the carbon 14 dates
                    for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> were handled.</p>
            <p>There are three appendices. One lists sites surveyed and dug in 1950 and 1952. Another, by William E.
                    Taylor, Jr., lists the sites from which materials were used to test the validity of the method being
                    used; this appendix also includes the ceramic chronology which had been established. The third lists
                    the ceramic wares and types involved in the study and provides the specialists with detailed data
                    permitting comparative studies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Pool and Irving Villages</hi> will be of value to the archaeologist interested in
                    the field of <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> prehistory. Moreover, it could well serve as a
                    stimulus for similar studies to be made elsewhere, including Indiana, and especially in the greatest
                    of all <placeName>

            <p>Too often memorial volumes of essays are collections of miscellany which are of slight value as
                    contributions to learning but excusable as a gesture of respect to an honored figure in the
                    profession. This volume is, however, of a different pattern. The essays have unity of theme and
                    something to say, and at the same time bring out repeatedlyâ€”not as interjected
                    eulogiesâ€”the wide interests of that indefatigable entrepreneur of historical research
                    materials and aids, Herbert A. Kellar.</p>
            <p>Both the history and the contemporary aspects of the ancillary fields of history dealing with
                    materials, methods, and aids are covered in nine essays as follows: "The W. P. A.
                    Historical Records Survey," by David L. Smiley; "Manuscript Collecting,"
                    by Lucile M. Kane; "Public Archives in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>," by G. Philip Bauer; "Mechanical Aids in Historical
                    Research," by George L. Anderson; "Foundations and the Study of History,"
                    by Richard D. Younger; "Historical Organizations as Aids to History," by David D.
                    Van Tassel and James A. Tinsley; "The Growth of Agricultural History," by Wayne D.
                    Rasmussen; "The Historian as Editor," by Lester J. Cappon; and
                    "Historical Restorations," by Edward P. Alexander.</p>
            <p>Particularly recommended for neophytes is Professor Anderson's essay on mechanical aids. He
                    envisions a happier mechanical future for plodding scholars once they are equipped with electronic
                    computers, punch-card machines, electrical sorters, voice recording machines, and a few other
                    devices still in experimental stages. Microfilm and microprint, of course, they appreciate already.
                    Less optimistic is Professor Younger's discussion of philanthropic foundations. It reveals
                    that social sciences fare worse than natural sciences in obtaining grants, that history rates lowest
                    of the social sciences, that individual projects trail behind group projects.</p>
            <p>Other essays present a wide assortment of facts: manuscript collecting now requires staffs of trained
                    collectors; the National Archives has 7,000 rolls of microfilm publications (5,000,000 documentary
                    pages); by 1950 there were 130 quarterly or monthly history magazines; the major function of most
                    historical societies is to "sell" history to the public through every type of
                    appeal without too much distortion of truth; by 1955 there were some 1,000 historical restorations
                    and 61,301,000 cars potentially able to take people to them.</p>
            <p>In this depersonalized world of automation and organized specialization, the old-fashioned scholar
                    with his fountain pen, his three-by-five note cards, and his precious sabbatical year seems near
                    extinction. In any case this is a most enlightening book, lacking only an index.</p>

            <p>It may not be the province of a book reviewer to debate the publishing philosophy behind a book, yet
                    one cannot but wonder why a university press spends money which might have been devoted to genuine
                    historical research upon an undocumented series of brief and generalized historical essays. Why,
                    furthermore, does the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName> History of American Civilization</hi> series require two books to cover the same
                    subject? Although the emphasis in <hi rend="i">The War for Independence</hi> is primarily military,
                    while that of Professor Edmund S. Morgan's <hi rend="i">Birth of the Republic</hi> is
                    political, economic, and diplomatic, there are inevitable repetitions and major disagreements in
                    interpretation between the two volumes. Together they simply constitute another narrative history of
                    the American Revolution which, although running a poor second to the Civil War, is one of the most
                    hackneyed topics in the gamut of the American past. What can Peckham and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName>, in their combined 378 pages, say that has not already been said by a thousand other
                    writers in every conceivable wayâ€”from Lossing's picture book to
                    Churchill's mellifluous tomes?</p>
            <p>This question seems to be especially pertinent when directed to the military aspect of the
                    Revolution. The revived interest in military history has inundated the market with recent books on
                    the campaigns and battles of 1775-1783. Ten years ago John C. Miller published his <hi rend="i">Triumph of Freedom</hi>, and this excellent survey was followed almost immediately by Willard
                    Wallace's brief summary and Christopher Ward's blow by blow account. Then came in
                    rapid succession the colorful narratives by Montross and Bill; the significant biographical studies
                    by Freeman, Alden, and Crane; monographs and articles too numerous to mention by Kyte, Willcox,
                    Barnhart, Nettles, and Knollenberg; and Alden's summary of the research of half a century
                    in his contribution to the <hi rend="i">New American Nation</hi> series-to say nothing of a plethora
                    of really good historical novels. The work of this remarkable decade has virtually rewritten the
                    history of the American Revolution, and while there are still some gaps in the research, the general
                    outlines have been fully sketched.</p>
            <p>If, nevertheless, still another book on the Revolutionary War had to be written, it could not have
                    been done by a better man than <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Howard</region>
                    </placeName> Peckham. During the author's residence in Indiana he imbibed from his Hoosier
                    surroundings a literary polish which, added to his originally felicitous style, makes any book he
                    writes worth reading, regardless of its contents. Add to this the fact that he is now the librarian
                    in charge of the best collection of British Revolutionary manuscripts in the country, and his
                    selection as author of this particular volume in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> series becomes eminently logical. Few historians could so well have combined solid
                    familiarity with the vast literature of the field, ready access to important source materials, and
                    technical skill. This becomes apparent in the introductory chapter with the following eloquent
                    observation:</p>
            <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-054-4-098"/>
            <p>"For a century and a half the story of the Revolution was a frequent topic of Fourth of July
                    orations delivered in the open under sunny skies. In truth, it should be a winter's tale,
                    told around a hearth on a windy night when there are no distractions, when images rise easily in the
                    flames, the crackling of logs suggests musket shots, and the comfortable warmth is enjoyed as a
                    dividend of that remote victory" (p. 5).</p>
            <p>One should not expect, however, to find anything new in so brief a treatment of so familiar a
                    subject, yet it may honestly be said that Peckham brings a certain freshness of viewpoint and a
                    great deal of enthusiasm to his work. He is especially helpful in clarifying such matters as chain
                    of command and immediate tactical responsibility, although perforce he pays little attention to
                    recruiting, finance, medical pervice, and logistics. He devotes less space to the interplay of
                    politics and warfare on the American than on the British side, where his explanations of the
                    seemingly incomprehensible moves by Howe, Clinton, Cornwallis, and Germaine are fully satisfactory.
                    One excellent feature which might have been sacrificed to the demands of space is the treatment of
                    the war after 1778 as a world-wide struggle, with due attention to the campaigns in the West Indies
                    and the Mediterranean as well as on the American continent. All of this makes the behavior of
                    Estaing and Grasse more reasonable than nationalistic historians have pictured it. On the other
                    hand, Peckham nobly resists the revisionist's compulsion to make a lucky blunderer out of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, unheralded strategists out of Gates and Lee, and a misunderstood patriot out of
                    Arnold. The story told in these pages is for the most part the traditional one, with the same
                            heroesâ€”<placeName>
                  <region type="county">Washington</region>, <region type="county">Greene</region>, <region type="county">Clark</region>, <region type="county">Wayne</region>, <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>, <region type="county">Morgan</region>
               </placeName>, Jonesâ€”that one learned to venerate in childhood,
                    presented with their halos slightly askew but still there, and with the reputations of the same
                    villainsâ€”Gates, Lee, Arnold, Tarleton, Butler, and Burgoyneâ€”tarnished as
                    usual, but painted with a little more realism.</p>
            <p>Like all the books in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> series, this one has no footnotes but contains an excellent essay on pertinent
                    bibliography, an adequate index, and a useful chronological table. The indispensable maps are sadly
                    missing but important place names are at least located on end paper diagrams. As one reads this book
                    and is about to write it off as an exceptionally good potboiler, Peckham suddenly throws in
                    something that gives it genuine superiorityâ€”such as the fighting record of a Negro Rhode
                    Island regiment (p. 100), or the fact that a state navy led by officers with such distinguished
                    names as Saltonstall and Revere could still be wiped out on the coast of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> (pp. 123-124).</p>
            <p>One of Peckham's most interesting chapters is the final one, "The Summing
                    Up," where he comes to grips with the imponderables of history. This will be highly
                    satisfactory to patriots. The author concludes that the American victory, obtained in spite of logic
                    and statistics, was not the result of French aid or British ineptitude, but of three American secret
                    weaponsâ€”the dedication of her officers, the higher morale of her soldiers, and George
                    Washington. One may not agree completely with Peckham's analysis but one cannot quarrel
                    with <pb n="403" id="VAA4025-054-4-099"/> his final sentence. "And the great
                    lesson," he avers, "the final discovery of the Revolutionary generation in its
                    search for political order, is revealed to us: that although the first payment for freedom is
                    courage, the installments due to keep it are unity and vigilance."</p>

            <p>This is one of the better volumes in the <hi rend="i">History of the South</hi> series. In the main,
                    it is clearly and concisely written; it shows extensive use of secondary and monographic studies,
                    adequately knit together with source materials; and a middle-of-the-road approach gives historical
                    balance.</p>
            <p>The author, well aware that there were many Souths at the beginning date (1763) of his study,
                    concludes that the South had emerged as a section by the end of the revolutionary epoch. The major
                    portion of the study is devoted to the five colony-states and their "western
                    lands," but the Floridas receive appropriate attention. In covering the twenty-six years
                    after the Seven Years' War, Alden sketches the general picture in some distinguished prose,
                    describes the post-war British program and the South's reaction to it, narrates the
                    expansion of the colonies, details the military engagements, analyzes the political, social, and
                    economic changes of the period, and tells of the role of the South in the formation and adoption of
                    the Constitution. The southern Indiansâ€”in a very different position after the defeat of
                    the French in 1763â€”move in and out of the story in proper perspective.</p>
            <p>In analyzing the new role of the British troops in North America, Alden feels that the sixteen
                    regiments were "unnecessarily numerous," the movement of the troops in 1768 from
                    the interior toward the Atlantic Coast denied the British claim that their purpose was the
                    protection of the colonies (and the colonials understood the significance of the move), and that any
                    such claim was "indefensible after 1770." Though British government in the
                    colonies "annoyed rather than seriously injured," increasing opposition was
                    nurtured by ineptness of the mother country officials. At the same time, internal conflict in some
                    of the colonies was becoming serious, and it is perhaps worth noting that while the North
                    Carolinians struggled against the "pernicious system of local government," the
                    South Carolinians were clamoring for more local officials and control. The author is strong in his
                    conviction that too much has been said about the Regulators as champions of democracy.</p>
            <p>Military events are allotted almost one hundred of the four hundred pages of text. This represents
                    unbalance, especially since only actual fighting is related. Further imbalance is found in this
                    section, for the battle of King's Mountain is given only one page.</p>
            <pb n="404" id="VAA4025-054-4-100"/>
            <p>Alden believes that the social and economic changes wrought by and during the Revolution have been
                    over-stressed. He thinks the term "Internal Revolution" is not justified since
                    economic shift was slight (p. 338) and since human slavery did not promptly disappear (p. 348). More
                    authors would do well to follow Alden's practice of carefully distinguishing among the
                    Conservatives, Democrats, and Liberals of the period.</p>
            <p>Usually there is no problem in understanding the meaning of the author, but there are a number of
                    instances of "antecedent trouble," for example, the second sentence of the
                    paragraph beginning in the middle of page 263. The fourth sentence on page 373 does not make sense,
                    and the last two on page 267 are strange bedfellows. In fairness, it should be noted that these are
                    counterbalanced by some finely turned phrases and sentences.</p>
            <p>Alden's volume is a good synthesis of developments in the southern colony-states during the
                    generation prior to the establishment of the Federal government. It will be especially valuable to
                    historians of the South, but other American historians can read it with great profit.</p>

                    $8.50.)</head>
            <p>In the midst of a plethora of Civil War histories Professor Freidel, biographer of Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt, presents a documentary and pictorial history of the Spanish-American War. History
                    professors have tended to emphasize the "quasi-comic-opera aspect" of the brief
                    struggle, admittedly with much justification, but Freidel reports the tough military campaigns
                    fought by the army and navy. He feels that the heroes of this struggle were not the spectacular
                    Roosevelts, Schleys, Deweys, Sampsons, or even Hobsons, but "some of the sailors
                    â€¦ the sweltering stokers â€¦ many of the soldiers, especially those in regiments
                    decimated before Santiagoâ€¦" (p. 3). These men, who had to fight in addition to a
                    tenacious enemy, disease, an oppressive and deadly climate, as well as to endure the antics of an
                    inept War Department, have not received the proportionate gratitude accorded their counterparts in
                    other American wars.</p>
            <p>The thousands of soldiers gathered at the various camps awaiting embarkation were issued obsolete <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> rifles and heavy blue uniforms more suitable for the arctic than the tropics, while
                    they were denied for some months modern rifles, smokeless powder, medical and hospital supplies. The
                    fighting at Las Guasimas, El Caney, San Juan, and Kettle Hills was severe and gave American troops
                    their baptism of jungle fighting. The Spaniards, despite the leadership of officers fatalistically
                    resigned to ultimate defeat, fought better than is generally believed. American naval personnel had
                    an easier time than did army personnel if one discounts the sweltering heat endured by those below
                    decks. Naval units at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Santiago</settlement>
                    </placeName> may not have been the most efficient <pb n="405" id="VAA4025-054-4-101"/> fleet ever to
                    engage the enemy, but it is doubtful if there ever had been a more enthusiastic one. When the four
                    destroyed Spanish ships were examined the investigating board counted 122 visible hits. American
                    forces had fired 9,433 shots.</p>
            <p>Professor Freidel has constructed this narrative from accounts by participants or other observers of
                    the action. Diaries, journals, and other writings of officers and enlisted men are extensively
                    utilized. Many famous American war correspondents wrote of the various campaigns; Stephen Crane
                    described the great sufferings of the Americans; Richard Harding Davis and others did much
                    substantial reporting from the front. Writings of foreign observers such as Winston S. Churchill are
                    also cited.</p>
            <p>The highpoint of this volume, however, lies in the extraordinary illustrative material. The sketching
                    of the talented Fredic Remington, Howard Chandler Christy, and William K. Glackens is outstanding.
                    Artists, nonetheless, must give precedence to the photographers. If there is no successor to Matthew
                    Brady among them, certainly Dwight L. Elmendorf, John C. Hemment, and James Hare must be considered
                    first-rate cameramen. Hemment, Hearst's man, developed his photographic plates on the
                    "Sylvia." Hare, who was to pioneer aerial photography and to win fame as a World
                    War I photographer, is considered by many to have been America's foremost war photographer.</p>
            <p>Freidel uses his materials intelligently and his narrative is always interesting and informative. He
                    makes no attempt to search out the motives for the war nor to assess its results. Rather he praises
                    those who fought this "popular crusade" and who found that war is never
                    "splendid."</p>

            <p>As the subtitle indicates, <hi rend="i">Times of Trial</hi> is a compilation of essays dealing with
                    some of the "great crises in the American past." These essays, appearing
                    originally as a series of articles in <hi rend="i">American Heritage</hi> were written by men whose
                    scholarly interests have given them close acquaintance with the events under consideration. Allan
                    Nevins and the other contributors apparently are among that group who yet believe that man may
                    profit from his mistakes. In all of the accounts there is an attempt to cut through circumstances
                    that may be deemed uncontrollable and isolate the one factor which might be subject to a measure of
                    control, i.e., the man who holds the reins of leadership.</p>
            <p>In the almost two hundred years covered by these analyses, the record of American leadership in
                    government ranges from the best in positive statesmanship to the worst bungling and foot-dragging.
                    Richard <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-054-4-102"/> B. Morris praises Benjamin Franklin for his role in the
                    precedent making <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Congress of 1754; Claude G. Bowers repaints the dilemma facing John Adams as he tried
                    to forestall a war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in 1798; George Dangerfield points out how President Madison, with an enviable
                    reputation for finesse, tripped himself up in his diplomatic maneuverings with Napoleon. Bray
                    Hammond shows that there was more than Old Hickory's frontier stubbornness behind the
                    attack on Mr. Biddle's bank; Allan Nevins demonstrates that the conventional caricatures of
                    the feeble Buchanan and "rise to the occasion" Douglas are valid; Bruce Catton
                    tells how bloody stalemate at Antietam provided <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> with an opportunity to stage one of his most astute diplomatic triumphs; and David
                    Donald attempts to disspell any heroic myths that may have attached themselves to the memory of
                    Andrew Johnson. C. Van Woodward portrays Ulysses S. Grant as a good general whose naivete in civil
                    matters did not equip him to lead a peacetime nation bordering on moral anarchy; William E.
                    Leuchtenburg exonerates McKinley, but indicts Hearst, Putlizer, and most of all, the American public
                    for launching the country into the imperialistic venture of 1898. In his essay Thomas Bailey credits
                    the failure of America to join the League of Nations to the injured ego of an extremely tired
                    Woodrow Wilson; John K. Galbraith concludes that the "do nothing" attitude of high
                    governmental leaders in the 1920's paved the way for the economic debacle of 1929; Merlo
                    Pusey clarifies the issues in Franklin Roosevelt's struggle with the "Nine Old
                    Men" and sees in the outcome a victory for the check and balance system inherent in the
                    American government. Finally in an epilogue, editor Nevins repeats a theme running through all of
                    the articles: "Our nation will continue to make mistakes and learn by trial and error
                    â€¦; but it at any rate has the armor of a slowly growing earnestness and
                    maturity" (p. 252).</p>
            <p>An obvious stratagem of the entire <hi rend="i">American Heritage</hi> project is to restore the
                    reading of American history as a popular indoor pastime. The average reader will not resent being
                    hypnotized a bit by the glamourous format of an <hi rend="i">American Heritage</hi> publication, and
                    it is likely that he will be better informed as a result of having perused its pages. The
                    "Crises" articles are clearly designed for what is sometimes called the
                    "literate layman"â€”most teachers of American history have, or should
                    have, been exposed to these generally standard interpretations before. But the nature of the
                    collection does not lessen the validity of what these distinguished contributors have to say. They
                    are not claiming that crises are always caused by faulty leadership, but they are here presenting
                    cases in which leadership was a determining element in the outcomes of the crises. In short,
                    Professor Nevins and his co-writers are repeating an admonishment to the American people that may be
                    more tenable today than ever before: if you want a workable, trustworthy government, choose with
                    extreme care the men who are to head it.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A History of the Dollar.</hi> By Arthur Nussbaum. (<placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>: <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
               </placeName>
                    University Press, 1957. Pp. viii, 308. Bibliography, index. $4.50.)</head>
            <p>Rather than a history of the dollar, this book is a history of the monetary system of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The author describes pre-revolutionary efforts to develop substitutes for specie
                    money, the decentralized banking before the Civil War, subsequent struggles against the
                    "silverites," the establishment of the Federal Reserve system, and finally the New
                    Deal and recent international monetary developments. The emphasis of the book is anecdotal, with
                    much attention given to legal and numismatic detail; and the author is not loath to express
                    judgments with respect to characteristics of what he calls the "American mind" and
                    also concerning the monetary policies of various American statesmen. Thus he devotes an equal number
                    of pages to the Legal Tender Cases (pp. 118-123), including an unfriendly analysis of the motives of
                    Chief Justice Chase, as to the "Rise of the Federal and Reserve System" (pp.
                    157-162). Among the items with which the reader is diverted are two of particular interest to
                    Hoosiers: one about a "Bank of Morocco" discovered "after long search, in
                    two Indiana log cabins" (p. 91); and the other about a subtreasury in Indiana (1855) which
                    reminded the "official supervisor" of "what Robinson Crusoe's
                    fortification was supposed to have been" (p. 95).</p>
            <p>With respect to the economics of deflation and inflation, the author is on uncertain ground. He
                    thinks it a "most striking phenomenon" that "the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as well as other countries suffering from inflation seem not to give much thought to
                    devaluation, which in the past has been resorted to as a final solution" (p. 221). This
                    puts the cart squarely before the horse. The price rise of 1956-1957 he thinks, "has been
                    counterbalanced to some degree by rising production, employment, and wages, by an increase in
                    leisure time, by expansion of consumer credit â€¦" etc. (p. 213). With respect to
                    World War I, "prices were bound to rise considerably [inter alia] because of â€¦
                    the <hi rend="i">decline</hi> [my italics] in gold imports â€¦" (p. 168).</p>
            <p>This history will I think be of limited usefulness to readers who want to understand the development
                    of the American monetary system. The book is provided with index, notes, bibliography, and a list of
                    Congressional enactments having to do with monetary affairs. In view of these advantages, the
                    reviewer ought perhaps to overlook inelegant and occasionally misleading phraseology.</p>

               </placeName>

            <p>Professor Marckwardt has used his skill and learning to produce an essentially non-technical work on
                    American English. Unlike so many popularizers before him, however, he has not sacrificed rigor to
                    the assumed taste of a linguistically naive audience, nor does he shy <pb n="408" id="VAA4025-054-4-104"/> away from inherent difficulties of his subject in order to concentrate
                    on the opposite extremes of the commonplace and the bizarre. From the nature of the subject, this is
                    primarily a descriptive work, but Professor Marckwardt does have a thesis: there is a
                    "close interaction of linguistic and cultural factors in the growth of American
                    English" (p. viii). Beginning with a chapter on Elizabethan English, a "highly
                    variable and complex" language which made divergence easier, he attempts to support his
                    thesis through discussion devoted largely to the American part of the English vocabulary. He
                    includes chapters on dialects and proper names, which should be of particular interest to local and
                    regional historians, and a final chapter on the future of English.</p>
            <p>When Professor Marckwardt demonstrates that new words were coined, or borrowed, or old words given
                    new meanings because the physical environment of America differs from that of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and because America has developed unique customs and institutions, his theory is quite
                    sound; and when he traces the American proclivity for hyperbole and "mouth-filling
                    terms" back to the exuberance of the frontier or our great number of euphemisms to the
                    position of women in nineteenth century society, he is still on safe ground. However, when the
                    author finds a cause and effect relationship between a purported "independence of spirit
                    and lack of regard for accepted tradition" (p. 108) and the by no means uniquely American
                    linguistic practices of grammatical change, backformation, blending, and compounding, he jumps from
                    fact to conjecture; and when, in the chapter entitled "The Colonial Lag," he
                    implies that a general American conservatism resulting from transplanting is accountable for our
                    retention of seventeenth and eighteenth century pronunciations, he moves from conjecture to
                    metaphysics. No matter how striking the parallels between facets of culture and linguistic
                    tendencies may seem, it can be proved that purely linguistic features such as pronunciation,
                    inflection, and word formation were affected one way or another by a speech community's
                    desires, spirit, or beliefs.</p>
            <p>Failure to make every aspect of the development of American English conform to a superimposed scheme
                    hardly detracts from the real worth of Professor Marckwardt's study; the language itself,
                    as it was and as it is, is still laid out before us, and that after all, is the purpose of the book.
                    Consequently, this book can be consumed with profit and with pleasure by the intelligent general
                    reader, by scholars from other fields who want to know or need to know something about the English
                    language in America, and by specialists in language study. Unfortunately, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University Press can not be complimented for its part in the work. Necessary words are
                    omitted on pages 16 and 184, the make-up of pages 34-35 is amateurish and confusing; on page 173 one
                    whole line is dropped out and another line repeated; finally, the binding is so poorly done that the
                    reviewer's copy came unsewn before it was read.</p>

            <p>This memoir, written by a granddaughter to preserve for descendants the story of her ususual
                    grandparents, is well worthy of publication. Making use of available letters and diaries, her
                    personal memories, and the recollections of one of the principal actors in the family drama, Mrs.
                    Royse has in delightfully informal style told a tale that takes us back a hundred years or so to a
                    time of simplicities and complications very different from those of our day. The author's
                    understanding of human nature is deep, and her humor keen.</p>
            <p>Joseph Bennet, the grandfather, after a successful business career in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, felt it necessary for reasons of health to remove his family to America. In May of
                    1837, he set sail with an unwieldy family group which included: three small daughters by his first
                    wife, his ailing second wife and their two baby daughters, his mother, and as general helper his
                    cousin, Mary Ann Rolfe. How the family group survived the six-weeks voyage on a poorly equipped
                    sailing vessel and, after brief rests in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the long journey inland by rail, canal, and river-boats, with at last eight changes
                    from one to another, is a matter for wonder in these days of easy travel.</p>
            <p>Their destination was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, near which Joseph bought a home. However, exploration along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> determined him to settle in Car-rollton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, where he invested in various enterprises. The second wife died in about a year,
                    leaving a sixth daughter.</p>
            <p>Here enters Bethania Croker, the daughter of a Cape Cod Presbyterian minister, a graduate of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. She started teaching when only fourteen, and three years later was called
                    to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>, <region type="county">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, to start a school for girls. At twenty, she married George Bishop, the
                    clergyman son of the president of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> University, and went with him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Within two years he died, leaving her with a baby daughter to support. In
                    1837, however, friends in Carrollton called her there to establish a girl's school.</p>
            <p>Here she met Joseph Bennet. They were married in 1840 and she joined the family in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. A new home was built in Carrollton and the family spent eight years there, with two
                    more daughters added. A baby son did not live long, and Joseph's death soon followed.
                    Liquidation of his estate left nothing for Bethania. Assuming full responsibility for the family,
                    she again started a school in Carrollton. From then until her death in 1877 she taught at schools in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Minneapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Not only was she an outstanding and understanding teacher, but she met her
                    responsibilities for Joseph Bennet's daughters as well as for her own. And not until all
                    the girls were gone did Mary Ann marry her "young man" who had followed her from <placeName>

                    and cartoons, biographical sketches, recollections, traditions, puffs about newsmen and newspaper

            <p>The wheat and tares are thoroughly mingled in this often racy but generally unbalanced picture of
                    Hoosier lifeâ€”especially of politicâ€”from the 1920's to the present. In
                    fact, this book displays more bias, less perspective, and more dramatic and gossipy writing than
                    perhaps its authors are aware. In particular, the might-have-beens of politics generally have at
                    least several important variables, though this fact is too frequently overlooked in <hi rend="i">Dateline: Indiana.</hi> Nevertheless, here is grist of value and "leads"
                    worth further study by those interested in recent Indiana history.</p>
            <p>Harold C. Feightner's "Vignettes of the Twenties" is a hard hitting
                    commentary on Indiana politics in the 1920's, plus occasional forays into the
                    1930's. Feightner deflates still further some already tarnished Indiana political leaders,
                    mainly Republicans, since they dominated Hoosier politica in the 1920's. Feightner
                    considers the Anti-Saloon League, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Horse Thief Detective Associations as an
                    unholy trinity which wielded heavy and ruthless hands over Indiana politics in that decade. The grip
                    of these organizations on Indiana was certainly substantial, but Hoosier politics at that time was
                    probably not so much a function of these three pressure groups as Feightner at least infers.</p>
            <p>Westbrook Pegler's 1940 sketch of Wendell Willkie as an example of the provincial Hoosier
                    type is inaccurate as well as very exaggerated. On the other hand, Ed Ziegner's
                    "Party Bosses And The Voting Machine" is a significant account of how the use of
                    voting machines in state nominating conventions decreased the power of party bosses and enhanced the
                    influence of rank and file party delegates. George Henley's "The Press Passes a
                    Bill" reveals much about the power of liquor interests and also of party leaders in
                    politics. He pictures Governor Ralph F. Gates making a courageous decision, supported by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> press, to modify the monopolistic permit system for beer which had been established
                    during the administration of Governor Paul V. McNutt.</p>
            <pb n="411" id="VAA4025-054-4-107"/>
            <p>Lester M. Hunt's "The Governor Takes a Firm Stand" is amusing satire on
                    the evasiveness of Governor Harold W. Handley at press conferences, but it could just as easily have
                    been written about nearly any Indiana governor or political leader. The selection from Abe
                    Martinâ€”certainly a better interpreter of the Hoosier than Westbrook
                    Peglerâ€”includes the quip that "No normally constituted feller kin read a daily
                    newspaper without congratulatin' himself that he ain't in jail or a candidate for
                    office" (p. 61). This quip takes on additional meaning after reading <hi rend="i">Dateline:

            <p>In 1909 a dirt-surfaced two-and-a-half mile automobile racing track was opened in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and dedicated to the proposition that upon it the infant motorcar would mature. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Speedway was to function as a kind of laboratory. Here all manner of inventions,
                    developments, and innovations could be assayed for use in ordinary passenger cars. This pious
                    pronouncement of the Speedway founders was so firmly implanted in the American consciousness at the
                    time, and has been so skillfully propagandized since, that it lives today with the force of law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Race</hi> is the latest attempt by a news photographer and a sports reporter to
                    preserve the tradition and legend of the Speedway. The Introduction states that "this is a
                    book about human beings and human emotions, illuminated by a sporting event." The cover
                    suggests that "<hi rend="i">The Race</hi> recreates the whole experience, from the moment
                    the first car is unloaded till the last visitor has gone home and only empty garages
                    remain."</p>
            <p>The photographs and text do not, however, accurately recreate the whole experience. Nothing in this
                    volume suggests that the true function of the Speedway is to make money. No words challenge the
                    clichÃ© that the track is a proving ground for the automobile industry. American
                    manufacturers are largely indifferent to it, and the major producers have their own proving grounds,
                    better suited to the purpose than <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The public has been deceived into thinking that the tremendous annual attendance at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> reflects an informed enthusiasm on the part of the American public. Most of those
                    attending have no basic understanding of automobile racing as such. They have no technical
                    understanding of driving skill, and anything but flat-out speed is lost on them. The answer to the
                    question as to why they come will continue to perplex observers for years.</p>
            <p>This publication will certainly preserve the legend and tradition of the <placeName>

            <head>State Museum Recommended as a Project for the Sesquicentennial of Statehood</head>
            <p>The Indiana State Museum Commission, authorized by the General Assembly in 1957, has submitted its
                    findings and recommendations to the members of the General Assembly for 1959. The Commission points
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> as excellent examples of states having effective museum programs of much educational
                    value for students and citizens; it also reports that Indiana has so starved and neglected her
                    so-called museum that the existing situation reflects very unfavorably on the achievements and
                    heritage of the Hoosier state. The major recommendation of the Commission is that a new museum be
                    immediately authorized and then completed as soon as possible. By so doing, museum materials can be
                    exhibited, and some of them used in all sections of Indiana, as an important part of the observance
                    of the Sesquicentennial of Indiana Statehood in 1966.</p>

            <head>General Index</head>
            <head>(XXVI-L, 1930-1954)</head>
            <p>A General Index of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> for the years 1930-1954, Volumes
                    XXVI-L, has been published and is available for distribution. The new index is comprehensive and
                    scholarly, making it an invaluable tool for students, authors, librarians, and teachers. It is about
                    four hundred double-column pages in length.</p>
            <p>The new index has been prepared by Elfrieda Lang, Assistant Curator of Manuscripts, Indiana
                    University Library, who was formerly Assistant Editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History.</hi> It covers all of the fourteen years during which John D. Barnhart was editor of
                    the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi>, except for the early months of 1955, as well as nearly all of the years
                    during which the late William O. Lynch edited the <hi rend="i">IMH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new index will be mailed to Indiana libraries which are regular subscribers of the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> and will also be mailed to all such libraries which become subscribers during 1958 or
                    1959. This distribution is made possible through a subsidy provided by the Lilly Foundation. To
                    other libraries and to individuals, the price of the index is $5 per volume. Indiana
                    libraries wanting more than one copy may obtain them at this price. The index is printed on paper of
                    good quality and bound with a tough paper binding.</p>
            <p>Copies of the first General Index, covering the years from the founding of the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi>
                    in 1905 through 1929, Volumes I-XXV, are available at $3 per copy (paper binding).</p>

                    General Index nor its predecessor is available through subscription agencies.</p>
