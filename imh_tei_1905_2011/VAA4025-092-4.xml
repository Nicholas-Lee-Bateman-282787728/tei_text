            <p>In the dominant historical image of African-American migration, great cities such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> appear as powerful magnets. Acknowledging the attractive power of big cities need not
                    prevent one, however, from recognizing the place of smaller urban communities in the migration
                    process. Such communities tend to be ignored when historians focus their investigations on the
                    largest cities. Yet during the quarter century after Emancipation, many black migrants to the North
                    found their way to small towns and cities.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Moreover, some African Americans
                    continued to migrate to small cities even when thousands of others traveled to <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName>, and
                    other major cities in the mass exodus from the South after 1915 known as the first Great Migration.
                    A few nonconformists even forsook big cities for smaller ones. Thinking of migration as synonymous
                    with big-city urbanization not only effaces the choices made by migrants who settled in small cities
                    and the results of their decisions; it also unduly homogenizes a black folk movement and tends to
                    shift the interpretive focus from the folk who made the movement to the forces that acted upon them.</p>
            <p>Indiana furnishes useful examples of African-American migration to places other than large cities. In
                    a state with only one metropolis, both black and white migrants to the country towns and small
                    cities that dotted the Hoosier landscape could find jobs and <list type="footnotes">

                    Homogeneity, in the Lynds' eyes, required "a small Negro and foreign-born
                        population."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In addition to its apparent ethnic homogeneity,
                    Muncie was attractive to the Lynds because it was an industrial city. <hi rend="i">

                    </placeName>'s black community grew substantially. During this time, the overall population
                    mushroomed from about 11,000 to more than 35,000. The African-American segment of that population,
                    meanwhile, increased from less than 4 percent to nearly 6 percent.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Thus, during
                    a period of rapid population growth the city's black population grew at a faster rate than
                    its white population. This study probes that phenomenon. First, the expansion of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s appeal to African-American migrants will be examined.</p>
            <p>The pace of African-American migration to Indiana varied considerably during the period from 1860 to
                    1930 (see Table l).<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In the 1860s about 11,000 blacks, mostly former slaves,
                    entered the state despite white violence directed against them and the presence until 1867 of a
                    black exclusion law. Most probably came during the war and in the year or two immediately after its
                    end, before Radical Reconstruction began to give southern blacks hope of making new lives in the
                    South free from white domination.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> While the struggles over Reconstruction raged
                    in the 1870s and 1880s, black migration occurred at a slower pace. It then quickened again during
                    the 1890s.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The flow diminished once more in the first decade of the twentieth
                    century, but a new and much larger wave began about 1915. During World War I and continuing through
                    the 1920s, the Indiana stream of the first Great Migration brought more than 50,000 African
                    Americans to the state. Thus, black migration to Indiana fluctuated greatly. In nearly all census
                    decades, however, Indiana's black population grew more rapidly than its white population,
                    since white out-migration consistently exceeded black in-migration.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                        rough approximations, given the inaccuracies of the federal census and the estimation methods
                        used. The federal census clearly underenumerated African Americans, although the frequency with

                        age-specific survival ratios from one census year to the next are calculated for the <placeName>

            <p>African-American migrants, whether moving into or within the state, distributed themselves throughout
                    Indiana's landscape in quite different ways before and after 1890. Before 1890, more blacks
                    lived in small towns and cities (43 percent of the total black population) than in rural areas (36
                    percent) or in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> (20 percent). Black Hoosiers were more urbanized than their white counterparts (see
                    Table 2). Blacks' greater degree of urbanization was caused not only by a higher
                    concentration of the African-American population in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but also by higher concentrations at every level of community size. Blacks'
                    lower concentration in rural areas was probably the result of most blacks' being newcomers
                    to the state at a time when rising land values and new machinery costs during the late nineteenth
                    century made entry into Indiana's mature agricultural economy increasingly difficult.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>After 1890, African Americans in Indiana began a decisive shift up the urban ladder. The rural black
                    population declined by one-quarter between 1890 and 1910, while the black population of the smallest
                    towns (less than 10,000 population) grew more slowly than did the state's black population
                    as a whole. Black urbanization was most evident in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the African-American population more than doubled over the twenty-year period.
                    Most striking, it was only in the largest size category (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>) that the black population grew faster than the white. In country towns and small
                    cities after 1890, white populations continued to grow, while black populations lagged. For small
                    towns and small cities considered as a whole, Table 1 and Table 2 together imply relative growth in
                    black population before 1890 followed by a relative decline that set in over the following twenty
                    years. New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> exemplifies the trend. There, blacks increased from 5 percent of total population in
                    1860 to 9 percent by 1890, but then both black numbers and their proportion of the community total
                    fell over the next twenty years. Farther north, the number of African Americans in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> more than doubled between 1860 and 1890 (from 133 to 304), but twenty years later only
                    34 more blacks were living in the community, which suggests that out-migration had surpassed both
                    in-migration and natural increase. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the percentage of black population <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-092-4-012"/> grew from 3.3
                    in 1860 to 6.7 thirty years later. It then declined to 2.2 percent by 1910. The pattern of
                    African-American movement to large cities, a pattern that first appeared during the 1890s, was to
                    reappear during the first Great Migration of 1915-1930 and again in the second Great Migration of
                    1940-1970, both of which were characterized by black migration directly from the rural or urban
                    South to the big-city North.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    common with the black populations of many other Indiana small towns (see Table 3). During the 1890s
                    blacks' share of total population fell from 3.7 percent to 3.5 percent. This percentage
                    decline was not caused by a declining, stable, or even slowly growing black population. Instead, the
                    number of black Munsonians increased substantially during the 1890s (77 percent), a fact that
                    strongly suggests that in-migration to the community far outpaced out-migration.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> African Americans' relative decline was the result of rapidly expanding white

                    cheap or even free gas to power their plants, many manufacturers moved to the region, and the
                    ensuing factory growth contributed substantially to the state's industrialization. The gas
                    boom accelerated a northward shift of the state's industrial center of gravity from the

                            determining rates of interstate migration, a procedure that involves counting those living
                            in a state during a given census year who were born in other states, is not suitable for use
                            with smaller units than states, since such a measure will omit intrastate migrants. Other
                            methods, which depend upon use of survival ratios drawn from either census data or life
                            tables, require breakdowns of community population by age, sex, and
                            "color" to measure migration by blacks and whites. Such data are available
                            for communities only from intensive analysis of the manuscript census for every census year
                            covered by the study. Such an analysis is impossible for any period including the census
                            year 1890, for which manuscript census data for most states (including Indiana) were

                    came after that date, with the bulk of the second group arriving during the 1920s. Of the pre-1915

                    the offering of lodging for new arrivals. In other cases it was indirect, in the form of information
                    about the journey or about conditions at the destination. Both forms of aid could be provided by
                    friends as well as family. Few migrants arrived completely alone in their new surroundings. Most

            <p>The predominance of chain migration suggests that many migrants accumulated a stock of knowledge
                    prior to uprooting themselves from their homes. Those who had family or friends at a potential
                    destination were likely to know the prospects for jobs, housing, and education and to be aware of
                    the state of race relations before setting off. Their decision to migrate, that is, was likely to be
                    an informed one.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Even without access to a chain of family and friends,

                    a disruptive, disorienting, and alienating experience, Richard Wright wrote in 1941:

            <p>Researchers typically measure migration using cross-sectional measures that identify the places that

                    migration not as a linear phenomenon in which each migrant moved directly from the rural South to
                    the urban North but as a constant flux. At any given time some people were moving south, east, and
                    west, while others were going north. Some were migrating from larger places to smaller places, while
                    many others were shifting from rural to urban environments. While the general tendency for African
                    Americans was to move from the rural South and the rural and small-town North to urban centers, this
                    path did not describe the course taken by every migrant.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

            <p>Researchers studying the "push" factors behind African-American migration from the

                    unskilled industrial jobs, a few were able to find semiskilled or skilled work in the factories. The
                    census noted an electrical engineer, a crane operator, gas makers in glass plants, boilermakers, and
                    machinists. Although most women found themselves in domestic service, some also worked in the
                    factories of such companies as Ball Brothers, Hemingray, and the Butterfield Canning Company at a
                    time when few industrial jobs were open to African-American women. Black cooks could find work in
                    factories as well as in private homes. James D. recalled, "You could always get a job in <placeName>

            <p>In addition to jobs, African-American migrants found integrated neighborhoods, schools, buses, and

                    theaters seated blacks only in the balconies. These two forms of discrimination continued at least
                    into the 1930s. Some parks and swimming pools were closed to blacks. Interviewees reported that

                    </placeName> continued to enjoy the fruits of the frantic industrialization spurred by the gas boom,
                    as firms such as Ball Brothers and Hemingray remained. Ball Brothers, for example, reduced its need
                    for labor as a result of extensive mechanization beginning in the 1890s, but the company still
                    employed 2,500 workers in 1936.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

            <p>With this industrial base, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> contributed, along with larger centers in both the North and the South, to the process
                    of prole-tarianizing the African-American work force, molding a population of mostly agricultural
                    laborers into industrial workers.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> For some migrants who experienced this
                    process, industrial work meant an intensification of work patterns learned in seasonal engagement
                    with the southern industrial economy. From the migrants' perspective, at least equally
                    important was the higher and more regular pay their labor in northern industries could command.</p>
            <p>For employers, hiring black workers may have meant hindering unionization by fostering division among
                    their workers—an action employers may have seen as especially necessary in a community
                    that attracted relatively few immigrant workers. Since the jobs black factory workers found were
                    generally the most menial and poorest paid, white employers and co-workers may have been able to
                    maintain racial stereotypes even in the face of black achievement. The ability of northern
                    industrialists to attract blacks to their least desirable factory jobs depended upon the
                    continuation of even worse prospects for African Americans in the South and in the rural and
                    small-town North.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it may be helpful to think of migrants' perceptions of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> as colored both by characteristics of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and by the southern and northern backgrounds against which migrants weighed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s qualities. Both <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> and these backgrounds changed over time. These changes, together with the developments
                    already discussed in this paper, suggest that the growth of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s black population occurred in three distinct stages. During the Civil War and
                    the quarter-century following emancipation, African Americans migrated from the Upper South to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> as they did to other small towns and small cities in the Midwest. They found settings
                    similar to the rural worlds they had left behind. During this period, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s appeal to black migrants depended on its similarity to other Indiana small
                    towns.</p>
            <p>After 1890, as the tide of migration in the Midwest began to turn toward the region's
                    largest cities, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> continued to attract black migrants. Factors contributing to its continuing appeal
                    probably included the countercyclical timing of its industrialization, the paucity of immigrants who
                    could compete for factory jobs, and its relative freedom from antiblack public violence.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, after 1915 African Americans from the Deep South joined a continuing stream of migrants from
                    the Upper South to fill the jobs created by a booming industrial economy. By this time, a black
                    community had formed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> of sufficient size to support migration chains that allowed the <placeName>

                    itself apart from the pattern of black out-migration that characterized other midwestern small towns

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                    heading north. Northern-born migrants relied upon prior experience of northern conditions, and
                    migrants from both North and South depended upon information gathered from family and friends about
                    potential destinations. Foreknowledge was necessary because northern towns and cities presented to
                    the migrant not a uniform field of opportunity but a patchwork of jobs varying in quantity and
                    quality, black communities differing in size and readiness to welcome newcomers, and race relations

            <p>During the Civil War Hoosier Republicans claimed that a very large proportion of their Democratic
                    neighbors were avoiding military service. In the wake of their party's disastrous 1862
                    defeat, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene County</region>
                    </placeName>'s Republican newspaper asserted that the loss "proves conclusively
                    that a large majority of the soldiers from Indiana are Republicans." To back their
                    contentions Republican newspapers throughout much of the war printed straw polls of Hoosier military
                    units that registered huge majorities for state and national Republican candidates.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most modern historians have discounted the wartime accusations of Hoosier Republicans as little more
                    than overheated political hyperbole. Young men volunteered in such great numbers at the beginning of
                    the war that it is hard not to believe that members of both parties volunteered in large numbers.
                    "Certainly," Kenneth M. Stampp has written, "Republicans could not
                    surpass the Democratic masses in devotion to the war effort" at the beginning of the
                    conflict. Democratic opposition to the war and the policies of the administrations of President
                    Abraham Lincoln and Indiana Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton did not develop, it is generally
                    held, until later with the advent of the Militia Draft and the preliminary Emancipation

            <p>The commonsense views expressed by Stampp and others have been reinforced by statistical evidence.
                    Gilbert R. Tredway found that predominantly Democratic congressional districts in Indiana actually
                    outperformed many Republican districts in raising recruits during the war. Analysis of county-level
                    data for the period before the draft similarly reveals no meaningful correlations between
                    volunteering and either Democratic or Republican dominance in <placeName>

            <p>With common sense and statistics arrayed against the Republican charges, no one has bothered to
                    undertake a detailed investigation of which Hoosiers volunteered for service during the Civil War.
                    The more closely one examines the political situation in Indiana and the letters of ordinary
                    residents, however, the more evidence one finds supporting the Republican charges. The public
                    statements of Democratic politicians, for example, suggest that Democratic opposition to Republican
                    policies was, in fact, quite strong from the beginning of the war. In an April, 1861, speech, John
                    G. Davis, the Democratic congressman from the Seventh District during most of the 1850s, proclaimed
                    that the South had not seceded, which was illegal, but was in revolution, which was legal. This
                    being the case, Davis concluded, it was wrong for the Lincoln <list type="footnotes">

                        rosters of Indiana volunteer companies usually give the enlistee's place of residence,
                        date of muster, and date of death or of release from the army. The place of residence provided
                        is usually a county, but in some cases a town is given instead. Town names can be tricky because
                        recruits apparently sometimes gave the name of the nearest town with a post office, even if that
                        town was in a different township or even a different county. The manuscript muster roles for the
                        11th provide the ages of the recruits but no other significant information. For the published
                        rosters, see Terrell, <hi rend="i">Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Indiana.</hi>

                    units to have included more transient young men than units from rural counties. This appears to have
                    been the case. The rural county unit chosen for study was Company E of the 43rd Indiana Regiment of
                    Volunteers, a unit raised in predominantly rural <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the period before conscription existed. The percentage (57.5 percent) of the
                    seventy-three Sullivan enlisted men recruits who appeared in the manuscript census was twice that of
                    the Vigo recruits. While many of the men listed in the census fit a nonpersister profile, there were
                    more sons of landowning families and a few more men with wealth of their own than was the case with
                    the Vigo recruits. Despite these differences a substantial percentage of privates (42.5 percent) did
                    not appear in the Sullivan census, and a number of the men who did appear seem to have been marginal
                    to the economy and society of the county.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>The noncommissioned officers of Companies C and D of the 11th and Company E of the 43rd were more
                    likely to be present in the 1860 census and less likely to exhibit characteristics associated with
                    marginal, nonpersister individuals. While the sergeants and corporals of Companies C and D were more
                    likely than the men they commanded to be present in 1860, still only a minority of them were in the
                    census. Some 42.9 percent of the twenty-four noncommissioned officers of Companies C and D were
                    present. Although they possessed little wealth, these men were much more likely to be skilled
                    workers. Of the thirteen noncommissioned officers in Company E some 76.9 percent, including all of
                    the sergeants, were in the 1860 Sullivan census. These men were more likely to be landowners than
                    were the men they commanded or their peers in the two companies of the 11th.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Based on these three companies, it appears that a substantial number of the volunteers from
                    west-central Indiana were drawn from the large pool of single, low-skilled, poor young men who did
                    not persist for long in any one place that social historians have discovered and described.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> This was especially true of the <placeName>

                    but more of those who did appear fit the nonpersister profile than was the case for the 43rd. Thus
                    it appears that a significant number of the men who volunteered for service had not been socialized
                    in the cultures or political ideologies of the Seventh District.</p>

                    </placeName> after their military service? Very little information about the volunteers of Companies
                    C and D is extant. What evidence there is suggests tentative identifications for six enlisted men
                    and one noncommissioned officer who were listed in the 1860 Vigo census. All seven appear to have
                    been Republicans. The characteristics of the volunteers and of the historical materials available
                    make it nearly impossible to identify more members of the two companies by party. With the exception
                    of Riley Township, which is discussed below, what is known about party affiliations is based on
                    lists of party activists and biographies in county histories written years after the war. These
                    sources generally contain information only on individuals who persisted and thrived in the county.
                    Most of the volunteers, however, appear to have been young, single, transient men, only a few of

                            have had an influence on who volunteered. The three-year 11th was preceeded by an 11th
                            Regiment with a three-month enlistment. While many of the characteristics of the men of the
                            two regiments were similar, the three-month men were more likely to be in the census, and
                            some of these men came from prominent families, including the important Republican
                            Fairbanks, Ross, and Paddock families and a son of Richard W. Thompson, one of the most
                            important Republican activists in the county. Most of the men from the three-month 11th who
                            reenlisted in the three-year 11th were nonpersisters. An exception was John E. Wilkins, the
                            only volunteer from Companies C and D of the 11th who is known to have left a written
                            record. His diary indicates that he was very devoted to the Union cause.</item>

                    <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-092-4-039"/> records for two townships together provide party
                    identifications for hundreds of the county's families. Among the officers, noncommissioned
                    officers, and enlisted men of the 43rd, some twenty-two can be identified by party. Four of the
                    enlisted men were War Democrats from the same family. James W. Lloyd, the head of this family, felt
                    so strongly about the war that he joined the 43rd in spite of family obligations, a substantial farm
                    to run, and other restraints. Lloyd was reported in a county history to have been the first man in
                    the county to volunteer for service and to have made a strong speech in favor of the war policy of
                    the Lincoln administration. Three of Lloyd's sons, including one who lived outside of the
                    county, joined the company with their father. Of eleven other enlisted men identified by party, ten
                    were Republicans, while only one was a regular Democrat. The party affiliations of five of the
                    noncommissioned officers can also be established: all five were Republicans. Two of the three
                    officers of the company were identified by party: both were Republicans. The proportion of
                    Republicans (77.3 percent) among the twenty-two men identified by party is quite extraordinary
                    considering that the average Republican share of the vote in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>

            <p>Was the hugely disproportionate number of Republicans among the volunteers of the 43rd who can be
                    identified by party an anomaly, or did Republicans among the more stable part of the population of
                    the Seventh District volunteer in disproportionately high numbers? An answer to this question can be
                    found by analyzing the predraft volunteers from four townships in Sullivan, <placeName>

                            1862, and 1864. A War Democrat is defined here as a pre-war Democrat who supported the

                            within a few years of the end of the war. Prewar Democrats who supported the Republicans
                            during the war and continued doing so for a long period after the war are counted as

                    were Democrats, and 84 (62.2 percent) were Republicans. Circumstantial, but inconclusive, evidence
                    suggests that some of the 49 men who could not be identified by party were probably Republicans.
                    Thus the number 84 for Republicans should be seen as a minimum figure. If only recruits who joined
                    units organized in 1861 are counted, the Republican percentage is even higher. Some 108 of the
                    township's recruits were in the 1860 census and joined during 1861. Of these men, 2 (1.9
                    percent) were identified as Democrats, while at least 76 (70.4 percent) were Republicans. As was the
                    case with the party affiliation figures from the 43rd, the percentage of Republican volunteers among

            <p>Many of the men present in the 1860 census fit the typical nonpersister profile. They were landless,
                    low-skilled, single, and young. A number, however, exhibited other characteristics. A surprising
                    number of volunteers were middle-aged, married, and propertied. Some thirty-eight of the recruits
                    were listed in the Militia Enrollment as being over thirty-five years old when they joined. Of the
                    thirty-eight, some twenty-seven appear in the census. Among these twenty-seven, one (3.7 percent)
                    was identified as a Democrat, and at least seventeen (63.0 percent) were Republicans. Some of these
                    men had grown sons who also volunteered. The most extreme example of this trend for older men to
                    join was the Republican <list type="footnotes">

                    pattern of enlistment existed among these highly visible political leaders as among the general
                    population. Republican activists and their sons were much more likely to enlist than were their
                    Democratic counterparts. There were thirty-four nuclear families of Democratic activists. Among the
                    activists and their military-aged sons in these families, only John S. Milam, aged thirty-eight,
                    joined the army. He served nearly one year as an officer before resigning. One Democratic
                    activist's son might have served, but this cannot be verified. Meanwhile, twenty nuclear
                    families containing Republican <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-092-4-043"/> activists provided at least

            <p>Jefferson Township was a rural township in the southeastern part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName>. It contained no towns of significant size. By the time the draft began, some
                    thirty-five men had volunteered for service. Twenty-seven (77.1 percent) of these men were in the
                    township at the time the 1860 census was taken. Fifteen of the twenty-seven (55.6 percent) can be
                    identified as Republicans. One was a farm laborer who worked for a Republican family, and the
                    remaining eleven men cannot be identified by party. Circumstantial evidence suggests that one of the
                    eleven unidentified men might have been a Democrat, while at least a few of the remaining men might
                    have been Republicans. Some twenty of the twenty-seven local men appear to have joined during 1861.
                    Of this group fifteen (75.0 percent) were Republicans. Jefferson's Democratic leaders and
                    their sons do not appear to have volunteered before the draft, but families of Republican activists
                    provided recruits. Whether one looks at enlistments in 1861 or at the time of the first draft,
                    Republican volunteering was out of all proportion to the township's average Republican vote
                    of about 18.7 percent.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    these men, 45 (43.3 percent) cannot be located in the township at the time of the 1860 census. Among
                    the 59 men who do appear in the census, 21 (35.6 percent) can be identified as Republicans, while
                    the party affiliation of the remaining men cannot be positively determined. Circumstantial evidence
                    suggests that 1 of the unidentified men was a Democrat, while a substantial number of the rest were
                    probably Republicans. If one looks at only the 53 recruits who joined in 1861, one finds that 21
                    (39.6 percent) were not in the census. Of the 32 men in the census, at least 16 (50.0 percent) were
                    Republicans, while the rest cannot be identified by party. The average Republican vote in Cloverdale
                    Township was only 30.1 percent. As was the case in <placeName>

                    and long-term persisters are known. By the time of the Militia Draft, Riley had provided some 108

                    (55.6 percent) were Republicans, and none can be positively identified as a Democrat. Among the 44

                    largely rural county with some small towns. Unlike the four townships just examined, Parke featured
                    a heavily Republican polity. In 1880, J. H. Beadle wrote a history of <placeName>

                    subject's military service, fathers who had sons who served, and party affiliation. Beadle
                    even records some instances of men who wanted to join but were prevented from doing so by various
                    factors. The people he wrote about do not represent a random sample of the county's
                    population but instead constitute a list of some of Parke's long-term persisters. Most
                    political studies of nineteenth-century communities suggest that such individuals predominated in
                    positions of authority and shaped the values and positions of their political parties. Indeed, many
                    of the men in Beadle's biographies were politicians, justices of the peace, and men
                    described as prominent in their communities. The men from Parke examined here, then, were
                    individuals who shaped political ideology and who were highly visible, well-known members of their
                        parties.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>The vast majority of Civil War volunteers were under thirty years old. An analysis of the men in
                    Beadle's work who were eighteen to twenty-nine years old at some point during the Civil War
                        <hi rend="i">(i.e.</hi>, born between 1832 and 1846) and residing in <placeName>

                    </placeName> when the war began reveals the following information. Of the seventy-one Republicans in
                    this age group, some forty-seven (66.2 percent) served in the military. If the six <placeName>

                    </placeName> Republicans are excluded from the list, the percentage volunteering rises to 69.2.
                    Among the fourteen Democrats in this age group only one (7.1 percent) volunteered. Among Parke men
                    born between 1826 and 1831, eight (36.4 percent) of twenty-two Republicans enlisted, while none of
                    the eight Democrats in this age group joined the military. Two Republicans born before 1826 and two
                    born after 1846 enlisted, while no Democrats in these categories volunteered. Note that, <list type="footnotes">

                            than those of the other three townships. The average Republican vote in Riley during the war

                    </placeName> counties in southern Indiana all had unusually high rates of enlistment in the predraft
                    period. <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clark County</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                        <region type="county">Sullivan counties</region>
                    </placeName>. While there is some variation from county to county, the percentage of Republicans
                    volunteering in each county is consistently higher than that of Democrats. These figures include
                    recruits from the draft period as well as that of the predraft time.</p>
            <p>In his biographies of the older men in the county, Beadle was careful to note when his
                    subjects' sons served in the military during the Civil War. Because the ages of children
                    are not recorded in the biographies, no accurate percentage of Democratic and Republican families
                    contributing sons can be given. What can be said is that among the numerous older Democratic fathers
                    whose biographies appear in Beadle's work, only two of them (both described as War
                    Democrats) had sons enlist. Each had two sons volunteer. In contrast, a substantial number of the
                    Republican fathers had one to five sons enlist. Excluding those soldier sons included in the figures
                    above, the thirty-one Republican fathers with volunteer sons contributed forty-eight recruits.</p>
            <p>In fact, Republicans in all of the counties listed in Table 2 contributed much more to the war effort
                    than their Democratic neighbors. While examples can be found of Democrats over thirty-five or under
                    draft age volunteering and prominent Democrats organizing volunteer companies, such examples are
                    uncommon. In contrast, dozens of examples of Republicans over and under draft age volunteering, of
                    Republicans organizing volunteer companies, of Republican non-volunteers described as helping
                    soldiers, their families, and the war effort, can be found in these twelve counties. To give just
                    two examples, of the sixty-seven men over thirty-five who volunteered from these twelve counties
                    fifty-four were Republicans, while of the eleven boys born after 1846 who enlisted, ten were
                    Republicans.</p>
            <p>The fact that a significant number of the Parke Republican fathers and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township Republican nuclear families had more than one son in the army coincides with a
                    great deal of anecdotal evidence contained in county histories and other sources from around the
                    Seventh District. Very few examples of Democratic families providing multiple volunteers for the
                    army can be found in the district, and almost all of these families were War Democrats. Conversly,

            <p>Could it be that while political affiliation appears to have been a major motivational factor for
                    volunteering among the more stable part of the population some other factor reflected in or masked
                    by political affiliation was the real causal factor? The answer is no. The most likely alternative
                    factor was regional origin. Since the Seventh District and the entire southern half of Indiana
                    contained many people who were from the South or whose ancestors had migrated from there, it has
                    been suggested that this segment of the population might have been less enthusiastic for the Union
                    cause. As noted earlier, there is no statistical evidence demonstrating that southern Indiana
                    provided fewer recruits than northern Indiana. With regard to the hundreds of Seventh District
                    volunteers examined in this study, there are no strong indications that being of northern or
                    southern birth or ancestry was a significant factor in determining whether or not one volunteered.
                    For instance, some 44.4 percent of the noncommissioned officers of Companies C and D of the 11th who
                    can be located in the census were born in a northern state other than Indiana or were sons of people
                    from other northern states. This is a much larger figure than the percentage (27.2 percent) of all
                    adult males in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo County</region>
                    </placeName> who had northern origins. However, the enlisted men and noncommissioned officers of
                    Company E of the 43rd displayed a disproportionate percentage of men of southern birth or ancestry.
                    Some 43.9 percent of the adult males of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName> were of southern origins, but bout 47.6 percent of the enlisted men and 90.0 percent of
                    the noncommissioned officers of Company E who can be found in the census were born in the South or
                    were of southern ancestry. In addition, regional origin had little if any impact on patterns of
                    volunteering among <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>. Among the Republicans born between 1832 and 1846, twenty-nine were non-Quakers of
                    southern birth or heritage, while twenty had a northern background. Of the twenty-nine southern
                    Republicans who volunteered, 69.0 percent enlisted, while 75 percent of the northern Republicans
                    enlisted. Some nineteen of the thirty-one Parke Republican fathers who had sons enlist were born in
                    southern states, while twelve were born in northern ones.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Republicans predominated among the volunteers from the more stable population, what was the
                    political orientation of the nonpersisters? Probably no definitive answer to this question can be
                    given. A few of the nonpersisters remained long enough in the polity from which they volunteered and
                    were sufficiently successful to be included in county histories. A few nonpersisters appear to have
                    been young men who had left home to work elsewhere but who returned home to enlist. However, these
                    two categories combined include only a very small part of the nonpersisters. For the vast majority
                    little can be known. What can be inferred from straw polls of troops and from general political
                    studies is contradictory. On the one hand, straw polls of soldiers often resulted in such
                    overwhelming Republican majorities that large numbers of nonpersisters must have voted Republican.
                    On the other hand, no study of mid-nineteenth century voting behavior suggests that unskilled,
                    single, rootless, young men and older unskilled laborers without property were overwhelmingly
                    Republican. If anything, existing studies suggest just the opposite.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most plausible hypothesis for explaining the political views of most nonpersisters is that the
                    majority of them did not have a strong political orientation when they joined and that many of these
                    weakly oriented volunteers were converted to the Republican view by the zealous party members who
                    joined in such large numbers. Over 40 percent of the privates in the three companies of the 11th and
                    43rd who could not be located in the census were too young to have voted in 1860. Given their
                    frequent movement, it is possible that many of those in their early and middle twenties had never
                    lived in a place long enough to meet residency requirements <list type="footnotes">

                    families and neighbors and unlikely to have established any personal pattern of voting, most of
                    these young men probably had no strong political orientation.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in the Seventh District the young Democrats who did
                    live at home, where strongly Democratic kin and neighbors could exert influence over them, did not
                    join the army in numbers proportional to their presence in the population. It is also supported by
                    one of the few literary sources left by a nonpersister. E. B. Reese was a young, single farm laborer
                    from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, when the war began. In his short memoir he says that he told his pro-Union employer, a
                    Reverend Milligan, that he was thinking about joining. The minister then took over, pushing his
                    ambivalent farmhand toward a decision to join and even bringing a recruiter to the house to sign him
                    up. Reese never really explains why he joined or for what he thought he was fighting. He makes some
                    vague comments about preserving the Union at one point toward the end of his memoir, but he makes no
                    clear pronouncement of his motivation for fighting or his views on slavery. Except for passing
                    references to Lincoln being a "great president," Reese has nothing to say about
                    politics. Aside from his recruitment story, he also has very little to say about <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen County</region>
                    </placeName> or Indiana. He appears not to have been integrated into the community to any meaningful
                    degree at the time of his enlistment. In fact, what seems to have impressed Reese most was not some
                    great national cause or duty to his adopted state or local neighborhood, but the camaraderie he
                    experienced with the men of his unit and the thrill and glory of battle.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>While Reese was ambivalent about why he fought, the letters of Republican volunteers from the Seventh

            <p>Fervently Republican soldiers did not fail to try to convert others to the views they held so
                    strongly. Their letters refer to their circulating pro-Union materials among their fellow soldiers,
                    to the availability of Republican newspapers among the troops, and to the muzzling of those who
                    might espouse Democratic views. The efforts of Republican soldiers to mold the views of their
                    comrades appear to have been as effective as the efforts of Reverend Milligan to push Reese toward
                    enlistment. For example, two young <placeName>

                    </placeName> officers of the 97th Indiana boasted to another officer, who was back in the Seventh
                    District, that the attitude of the men of their regiment toward Lincoln's preliminary
                    Emancipation Proclamation had changed. At first many of the soldiers were very upset by the
                    proclamation. Then, apparently, Republicans in the unit went to work. The discontent of the soldiers
                    was quieted. The men then were persuaded to reverse their opinion and support the proclamation. Soon
                    the men of the 97th were giving unanimous approval to resolutions in favor of Lincoln's
                    policy, resolutions that were sent off to Hoosier Republican newspapers for publication.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The presence of fervent Republicans, the relative absence of strongly
                    Democratic soldiers (especially early in the war), and the weak and malleable political views of

                        revivals were not caused primarily by a fear of death among the soldiers but were mainly the
                        result of purposeful evangilizing by religious organizations. The evangelizing was most
                        successful where officers supported it. See Drew Gilpin Faust, "Christian Soldiers: The

            <p>Two major facts stand out about the men who volunteered for the army from the Seventh District during
                    the period before a draft existed. First, a substantial proportion of the volunteers were young,
                    single nonpersisters who were not socialized or politically rooted in the county or township from
                    which they volunteered and who probably did not have strong political orientations. The percentage
                    of volunteers who were nonpersisters appears to have been greater in Vigo, a relatively urban
                    county, but the figure for rural <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName> was also substantial. Second, among the more stable parts of the population,
                    Republicans were much more likely to join the army than were Democrats, especially during the huge
                    initial surge of volunteers in 1861. The great difference between Republican and Democratic levels
                    of participation suggests that political ideology was an important motivational factor for
                    volunteers and nonvolunteers among those rooted and socialized in the party politics of west-central
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>The west-central Indiana Republicans who complained about Democrats not joining, then, were at least
                    partially correct. The Democrats they knew—long-time neighbors and political activists
                    and their sons—did not in fact join in significant numbers. However, these same
                    Republicans failed to note the large numbers of nonpersisters who volunteered. These young, rootless
                    men were nameless faces who passed into the army without being noticed. The number of nonpersister
                    volunteers appears to have been large enough to eliminate significant statistical differences
                    between county-level data on party dominance and data on level of enlistment. In essence, the large
                    numbers of nonpersisters masked statistical differences that might otherwise appear between heavily
                    Democratic and heavily <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Republican counties</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>While almost all the data presented here comes from only one congressional district, there is no
                    reason to believe similar patterns of volunteering did not take place in areas of Indiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and other midwestern states with political and socioeconomic characteristics similar
                    to those of the Seventh District. Indeed, the statistics in Table 2 suggest that the pattern of
                    enlistment in west-central Indiana probably existed, with some variations, in other regions. If the
                    findings here are in fact applicable to large areas of the Midwest, then they raise some interesting
                    questions about the existing literature on volunteers and their motivations. Can one, for instance,
                    make claims about the "patriotism" of all of the people of a county based on a
                    simple examination of volunteer and census numbers when so many recruits were not socialized in the
                    county and when large segments of the stable population may not have volunteered in significant
                    numbers?</p>
            <p>The facts presented here also have implications for the fine studies of Union soldiers and their
                    communities written by Reid <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Gerald E. Linderman, and others. Among other things, <pb n="344" id="VAA4025-092-4-054"/> these studies describe how communities encouraged enlistment, courage
                    on the battlefield, and relatively good behavior in camp.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> While the figures
                    here in no way refute the theses of these works, they do suggest some caveats. Many of the soldiers
                    who went to war had no ties to the communities in which they enlisted. Republicans seem to have been
                    under many of the community influences various authors have described, but, obviously, the Democrats
                    of west-central Indiana were not subject to the same kinds of pressures that their Republican
                    neighbors experienced. Communities did not exert pressure on all the men they sent to war, and they
                    were not monolithic in their support for the war or in the kinds of influence they exerted on young,
                    longtime residents.</p>
            <p>The facts presented here also have potential implications for the study of women and family life in
                    the Midwest during the Civil War. Most of the best work on the impact of the war on women and
                    families has focused on the South, where the large manpower demands of the Confederacy had a very
                    serious impact on domestic institutions.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> When scholars turn their attention to
                    the Midwest, they are going to find a different situation. Large numbers of the early recruits in
                    this region were single men who were not significantly integrated into their communities. Not only
                    was this true of enlistment in early units like the 11th and 43rd, but it may have been true of
                    subsequent enlistment as well. For example, Beadle's <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke County</region>
                    </placeName> history contains information on some ninety-nine married men of all political types
                    born between 1826 and 1846. Only 26.3 percent enlisted, and some of those who did enlist did not do
                    so until the last year or so of the war. In addition, Democratic families were probably not affected
                    by the war to the same degree as Republican families.</p>
            <p>Finally, this study suggests that historians may need to be more sensitive to the limitations of the
                    literary materials available about the Civil War. While many of the recruits analyzed here were
                    single men with few ties to the communities in which they enlisted, <list type="footnotes">

                    for information about soldiers are generally those of married men and of families who persisted in
                    one place for a long time. The major guide to the manuscript collections of the Indiana Historical

                    addition, some 56.3 percent were written by officers or surgeons, men who were more likely to be

            <p>Reverend Samuel Sayford's Lutheran church still stands at the Crossroads, a spiritual
                    sentinel guarding <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware County</region>
                    </placeName>'s southwestern corner. The dark brown bricks have weathered just as traffic
                    has faded along the two lonely county roads that meet nearby. Several stone throws'
                    distance from the church lies the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName> line. That boundary's invisible presence, as if acting in accordance with pure
                    Lutheran doctrine, is dependent upon the faith of the believer.</p>
            <p>Like those of many other Hoosiers, Sayford's life became bound up in the American Civil War.
                    He could not have suspected that the little seminary from which he graduated in 1835 would be swept
                    with rifle shot three decades later. Poised on a ridge in <placeName>

               </placeName>,
                    the building in which he studied Christ's grace witnessed some of the worst horrors of
                    battle. Nor could he foresee that his own son, a boy just three weeks shy of his twenty-first
                    birthday, would die in that war amid the brambles and cane-brakes of a desolate and nearly forgotten
                    portion of the South.</p>
            <p>Reverend Sayford arrived in central Indiana in 1848, and his hard years of riding and preaching
                    brought to life one of the earliest Lutheran congregations in that part of the state. Three years
                    after the war this same congregation, weary of an Ishmaelite existence and enjoying a brief spasm of
                    prosperity, built the church that still welcomes Lutheran faithful today.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Many hands built the church, some belonging to battle-hardened survivors who had been friends of and

                    their lives the physical and emotional scars that all wars produce.</p>
            <p>Crossroads itself never amounted to much, and its story is like that of many other Indiana
                    communities. The railroad never came through; roads, once thought to be paved with possibilities,
                    were bypassed by others; tolls fell off from precious little to absolutely nothing. Many of the
                    founders, astutely reading the writing on the economic wall, packed up surveyor instruments and plat
                    books and headed out for parts unknown. One hundred thirty years after the war, Crossroads, Indiana,
                    consists of one church and an atoll of houses surrounded on all sides by a sea of corn.</p>
            <p>In point of fact, Crossroads never even attained the status of a village. It remains today a dot on
                    the map where the roads meet in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Township. The township itself is a five-mile by seven-mile wedge of gently rolling
                    countryside unremarkable in appearance to the casual observer. There are no natural landmarks to
                    distinguish this part of east-central Indiana from neighboring townships. The only physical feature
                    of note is the <geogName>White River</geogName>, which makes a cameo appearance in the

                    </placeName> Township in the early 1820s and began clearing the land with typical Hoosier energy.
                    What consisted originally of temporary hunters' huts and Indian trails running through the
                    wilderness evolved eventually into one of Indiana's fine agricultural centers.</p>
            <p>The land, once cleared, proved so rich and black that it would have been a poor farmer not to have
                    prospered. Bearing testimony to <placeName>

                    $7.81 an acre when public lands could be had for $1.25 in the rest of the
                    county. Between the clearings grew stands of black walnut trees in such profusion that residents
                    named them the "Rich Woods." One portion of this deep tract, aided and abetted by

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township residents listed their chief occupations as blacksmiths, millers, carpenters,
                    wagon makers and the like. The professional ranks were not exactly swollen, consisting of one

                    "professional" a bit—one "cigar maker." Reverend
                    Sayford, whose ministerial salary could be measured more often than not in bushels, listed himself
                    as "Farmer."</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township. John Gustin had attempted a general merchandise shop at the Crossroads in
                    1832. He lost money and hope in quick succession and abandoned the enterprise. William and Erasmus
                    Moffitt entered the mercantile lists at Crossroads in 1838 and hung on stubbornly for several lean
                    years. At one time or another and in one form or another, between the mid-1830s <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-092-4-059"/> and the 1880s, Crossroads supported a church, wagon shop, cooper shop,
                    school, post office, general store, and a brace of blacksmith shops.</p>
            <p>Into this peaceful community blew the American Civil War. Like the legendary Indiana tornados that
                    come every spring, the war arrived and left in its wake unprecedented emotional destruction. The
                    citizens were no strangers to hardship. There could be no such immunity among people who created
                    farms and industries out of a frontier environment. However, when the great test came, Crossroads,
                    like the rest of the nation, stood blissfully unaware of the sacrifice to be demanded of it. It is
                    fairly said that every Indiana community, large and small, suffered the tragic consequences of the
                    Civil War. At the Crossroads, a small and unpretentious mark on the map, war's human cost
                    received magnification in a proportion far beyond the census statistics. Not one Crossroads
                    inhabitant escaped the war's fury. Candles burning by the window periodically announced to
                    neighbors that one of their own had paid the price of preserving the Union. Despite the cost,
                    loyalty to the old flag flowed unabated in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township, a tiny corner of the Union that consisted in the main of homegrown Hoosiers
                    and transplanted Pennsylvanians and Ohioans. A large contingent of former Virginians, 188 of them to
                    be exact, remained overwhelmingly loyal to their adopted state and the national cause.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>The casualties of the war were immense, and every letter arriving from the front threatened to bring
                    sorrow to the people at home. It is true that the casualties of war littered such places as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Seminary Ridge and the banks of the Chickamauga. But the war also reached
                    down into thousands of communities like the Crossroads, where each individual death produced dozens
                    of wounded back home in the form of grieving parents, children, wives, and sweethearts.</p>

            <p>Thursday, April 30, 1863: Admiral Porter's big naval guns thundered upriver at Confederate
                    installations at Grand Gulf, located immediately below Vicksburg. It was an impressive show, but as
                    the enemy seemed too well prepared there, the movement was only a feint. The soldiers in General
                    Sherman's corps sweltered in their transports while Grant and the remainder of the army
                    drifted south, looking for a better place to cross the <placeName>

            <p>The opponents collided there early on May 1. What began as one battle quickly degenerated into two
                    separate encounters with the enemy. The terrain dictated the action as the combatants grappled in
                    the clearings. The approaches to the rebel position were broken by brush-filled ravines and gullies,
                    rendering effective coordination among friendly units impossible. The Union left, including the 69th
                    Indiana, assailed the enemy's right flank while a division that contained the 8th Indiana
                    assaulted their left. After a hard fight the enemy was driven away. Casualties were heavy on both
                    sides, and Augustus Sayford himself was left dead on the field.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                                    Logan and his men we would have been captured. We went into camp on the battle field
                                    and made coffee and prepared a bite to eat for we had not had anything to eat since
                                    the day before and we were getting pretty lank. Then we gathered up our dead and
                                    wounded and cared for them either dug graves or dressed wounds then we took a little
                                    trip over the battle field. It certainly was a sight to see where the enemy had been
                                    slaughtered in the cane brakes by Logan's artillery. Early the next morning
                                    we moved on to Raymond where a big battle was fought and from there to
                                    Edward's Station and on in the direction of Jackson Mississippi and then we

            <p>This long-awaited work is one of the most important volumes ever published on the history of Indiana.
                    L. C. Rudolph's prodigious research has given us by far the best book we have on religion
                    in the state. While some readers will question some of Rudolph's choices, no one can doubt
                    the contribution he has made to understanding a fundamental aspect of Indiana's past. This
                    is a magisterial work that will not likely be superseded in the foreseeable future.</p>

                    sums up what little is known of Native American spirituality in Indiana, Rudolph focuses on

                    while adding other chapters on movements like Spiritualism and Holiness. In a few places, as in his

                    religion in Indiana has revolved around denominations.</p>
            <p>Within his denominational framework, Rudolph makes clear the significance of events in Indiana for

                    Church; and John Francis Noll, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> who made his weekly newspaper, <hi rend="i">Our Sunday Visitor</hi>, the most widely
                    circulated Catholic periodical in the country. Rudolph also illuminates how the Indiana branches of
                    certain denominations played critical roles in their larger bodies. For example, the longest single
                    chapter in the book is on Quakers. They were always a tiny percentage of the state's
                    population, but they exercised an influence out of proportion to their numbers. By 1900 <pb n="361" id="VAA4025-092-4-071"/> Indiana had more Quakers than any other state in the
                    union–far more than <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. This in turn made Indiana one of the world's centers of Quakerism.</p>
            <p>Rudolph's greatest service is in offering a broad synthesis. For almost any denomination in
                    Indiana, there is a mass of annual conference minutes, reports of special meetings, biographies and
                    autobiographies, published sermons, local congregational histories, and periodicals; not to mention
                    unpublished records, sermons, and correspondence. For most denominations there are state or regional
                    histories and scholarly studies as well. Rudolph has done an extraordinary job of mastering this
                    mountain of material for all of the groups that he treats. Not only does he cover events in Indiana,
                    but he incorporates developments in the larger denominations to which these groups belonged. One
                    will learn much general American religious history in these pages.</p>
            <p>Still, Rudolph leaves some things undone. His denominational conceptualization, while certainly
                    appropriate, creates problems. There are some aspects of Indiana's religious history, as
                    Rudolph recognizes, that do not fit neatly within denominational boundaries. Thus the Ku Klux Klan
                    is in the "Major Minorities" chapter. Other subjects show up in unlikely places.
                    Rudolph's discussion of women's religious activities, central to the lives of so
                    many congregations, is in the chapter on holiness movements. Discussions of abolition are scattered
                    through treatments of Quakers, Presbyterians, Methodists, Wesleyans, and other groups. Significant
                    interdenominational efforts of the nineteenth century, like Sunday schools and Sabbatarianism, do
                    not find a place. For example, there is no entry in the index for the Woman's Christian
                    Temperance Union, certainly the biggest religiously based reform group ever to exist in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Rudolph's chronological scheme is also at times unclear. The treatments of some
                    denominations almost cease around 1900. For example, there is almost nothing on Methodists and
                    Disciples of Christ after 1920. Most of the twentieth-century history here is of new denominations,
                    like Pentecostals, or of denominations new to Indiana, like Southern Baptists or the Salvation Army
                    or Eastern Orthodox groups. Twentieth-century ecumenical activities like those of the Indiana
                    Council of Churches are not treated.</p>
            <p>Finally, the emphasis here is institutional. The accounts of denominations focus on leaders. While I
                    did not count, I would guess that over 90 percent of the individuals Rudolph mentions are clergy.
                    For the most part, Rudolph chooses not to enter into the scholarly dialogue among historians of
                    American religion about what was going on in the pews as opposed to in the pulpits. In some cases,
                    Rudolph does give us a sense of how religion reflected ethnicity, as in his treatment of ethnic
                    Catholics or nineteenth-century German groups. On the whole, however, we do not come away with <pb n="362" id="VAA4025-092-4-072"/> a clear sense of why some Hoosiers chose to be Methodists,
                    others Baptists, others Christians, and so on.</p>
            <p>To ask more of this work than it gives us is probably unfair. Instead, we should be grateful for what
                    Rudolph has accomplished in <hi rend="i">Hoosier Faiths.</hi> That accomplishment is impressive and
                    significant. What he leaves undone will set the agenda for a new generation of historians of
                    religion in Indiana, for his work will be their starting point.</p>

            <p>The year 1996 marked the sesquicentennial of the forced removal of 323 Miami people from their
                    Indiana homeland to a reservation in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Territory. This removal was followed by a second forced migration in 1867 from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>, where the federally recognized and officially named Miami Tribe of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> maintains its headquarters in the town of Miami today. But not all the Miami people
                    left Indiana in 1846. Following allocation of former tribal lands in the valleys of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Mississinewa rivers to village leaders and their families, 148 Miami Indians were
                    permitted to remain legally on these family reserves. By offering refuge to others who had evaded
                    removal and to still more who quietly returned from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>, the Indiana Miami did not melt into the general population within a generation as had
                    been predicted but remained a viable and growing, though largely invisible, community. As far as the
                    federal government was concerned, the Miami tribal government was in the West after 1846, though the
                    treaty rights of the Indiana Miami continued to be acknowledged in principle if not always in
                    practice. Thus, before the end of the nineteenth century, two separate Miami tribes had emerged, one
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>, the other in Indiana, both enjoying federal recognition.</p>
            <p>The year 1997 will mark the centennial of a calamitous turning point in the history of the Indiana
                    Miami. On November 23, 1897, newly appointed Assistant Attorney General Willis <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Devanter (later a justice of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Supreme Court) rendered an administrative decision that terminated federal recognition
                    and assistance to the Indiana Miami on the grounds that their remaining (and drastically diminished)
                    allotted lands were individually owned and not tribal and that they were thus "citizens and
                        <pb n="363" id="VAA4025-092-4-073"/> not Indians under federal law" (p. 173).
                    Reflecting prevailing federal policy under the Dawes (or General Allotment) Act of 1887, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Devanter's decision was in keeping with the stated objective that
                    "all reservations were to be divided, surplus land sold, and Indians made over into small
                    farmers…. tribal governments would cease to exist. Indians would be on their own to
                    compete in American society" (p. 173).</p>
            <p>Ironically, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Devanter knew the Miami people well. His father had accompanied those journeying to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Territory in 1846 on their "trail of tears" and had later served as
                    an attorney for the Indiana Miami. His grandfather's farm bordered the Meshingomesia
                    reserve in the valley of the Mississinewa. Yet, like most of the general society at that time, he
                    apparently believed he was doing the Miami a favor by hastening the demise of tribal ties and
                    encouraging their complete acculturation into the larger American society. <hi rend="i">E pluribus
                        unum.</hi> Out of many, one.</p>
            <p>A century later, the tide of public opinion has turned and with it federal Indian policy.
                    Encouragement is given today to the concept of diversity in a pluralistic, multi-ethnic society.
                    Indian identity is now being celebrated, not hidden or submerged. As Chief Francis Shoemaker of the
                    Indiana Miami expressed it so well in July, 1985: "We've come out from under a
                    rock, and we're going to stay out" (p. 299).</p>
            <p>The story of the Indiana Miami (officially the Miami Nation of Indians in the State of Indiana) is
                    both timely and well told by Stewart Rafert in <hi rend="i">The Miami Indians of Indiana: A
                        Persistent People, 1654-1994.</hi> His argument is that the Indiana Miami deserve federal
                    recognition as a tribe. Indeed, much of his professional career has been spent working toward that
                    goal. The fact that the goal has not yet been reached, even in the present favorable climate of
                    public opinion and federal policy, lends particular poignancy to the telling of the story.</p>
            <p>Rafert's work with the Indiana Miami began with his University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> doctoral dissertation, "The Hidden Community: The Miami Indians of Indiana,
                    1846-1940" (1982). Rafert was the first recipient of a graduate fellowship for study in
                    midwestern history from the Indiana Historical Society. After receiving his doctorate, he became an
                    employee of the Indiana Miami, "a much different role than that of researcher of the
                    tribe" (p. 269). He "spent two years preparing the Indiana petition for federal
                    recognition…. which stretched into another seven years before the Bureau of Indian
                    Affairs rendered a decision" (p. 271).</p>
            <p>Far more than a rehash of his doctoral dissertation, Rafert's new book appropriately
                    considers the history of all the Miami people from the beginning of historical contact in 1654, when
                    they were living in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, to the removal of many from Indiana in 1846. For the period after removal,
                    Rafert's attention centers almost <pb n="364" id="VAA4025-092-4-074"/> exclusively on the
                    remaining Indiana Miami. He highlights not only the social, cultural, and subsistence changes
                    experienced by them, but also the persistence of older ways that have allowed them to avoid complete
                    acculturation and have kept them Indian.</p>
            <p>Though once a nation of an estimated 12,000 people, the Miami at the time of removal and separation
                    in 1846 numbered scarcely 500. In contrast, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> Miami today number more than 1,500, while the Indiana Miami number more than 5,000.
                    (Interestingly, Rafert rarely refers to either group by its official name, preferring instead to
                    call the one the "Western Miami" and the other the "Eastern
                    Miami.") Notwithstanding their numbers, the hope of the Indiana Miami for restoration of
                    federal recognition and attendant benefits remains just that–hope.</p>
            <p>Despite a campaign that began in 1979, the support of the Indiana congressional delegation, and all
                    of the research of Stewart Rafert, the effort to achieve federal recognition has been repeatedly
                    rebuffed. The culmination of all this frustration came on June 9, 1992, when the Bureau of Indian
                    Affairs made its final finding against recognition of the Indiana Miami "based on alleged
                    insufficient evidence of a distinct contemporary tribal community and lack of tribal political
                    process since the early 1940s" (p. 288). According to Rafert, however, the real stumbling
                    blocks were: (1) the large size of the Indiana Miami population (as much as ten times the size of
                    some tribes that have succeeded in gaining recent recognition) and consequent budgetary
                    considerations for federal services; (2) the fact that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> Miami were already recognized; (3) the opposition of "reservation tribes
                    [that] did not want competition for federal dollars from a new tribe that they regarded as highly
                    acculturated"; and (4) "the issue of casino gambling free of state
                    regulation" (pp. 290-92).</p>
            <p>In September, 1992, the Indiana Miami, led by Chief Ray White, marched from their tribal headquarters
                    in Peru to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they filed a lawsuit against the Interior Department to compel a restoration of
                    federal recognition. That action, too, ended in frustration with a judicial ruling "that
                    the tribe had waited too long to sue [1897-1992] and was blocked by the statute of
                    limitations" (p. 293).</p>
            <p>While their recent past has left some painful memories, the Miami Indians of Indiana have achieved a
                    revitalization that few would have dreamed possible at the beginning of this century. With the help
                    of Stewart Rafert and the Indiana Historical Society, they will celebrate their Miami-ness far into
                    the future.</p>

                    feeling that Thomas D. Hamm, Earlham College's distinguished church historian, has engaged
                    them in a threshing of old straw. The story he tells of the Society for Universal Inquiry and Reform
                    has never been told before; surprisingly, few of even the most detailed accounts of antebellum
                    reform take note of it. Yet, as this book demonstrates, the organization and its personnel deserve
                    the intensive research Hamm devoted to them.</p>
            <p>Founded in 1842 by a small, inspired group of radical reformers, the society aimed to form ideal
                    communities that would provide models for the reconstitution of an America that from their point of
                    view had gone awry. By the 1830s misgivings about the course of American development had produced an
                    array of reform movements designed to remove the ills and evils that beset society and thereby
                    promote human welfare and, not incidentally, also render the nation more pleasing in the sight of
                    God. Among the most dedicated of these reformers were the founders of the Society for Universal
                    Inquiry and Reform.</p>
            <p>The society proceeded to establish eight communities designed to give form and force to their
                    renovating principles. Four of these were in Indiana: Union Home in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Randolph County</region>
                    </placeName>, West Grove or Fraternal Home in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jay County</region>
                    </placeName>, Kristeen in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marshall County</region>
                    </placeName>, and Grand <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren County</region>
                    </placeName>. Although all had disappeared by the end of 1846, their short life does not mean that
                    they and the earnest men and women who created them left nothing of value to posterity and are
                    deserving of their long obscurity.</p>
            <p>Their record, brief though it is, reminds us that not all Americans welcomed the highly competitive,
                    atomistic economy and society that characterized Jacksonian America and to some extent persists
                    today. The founders of the society, it is instructive to note, were not foreign-born revolutionaries
                    nor adherents to alien ideologies. Their family roots as well as their ideas were at least as old as
                    the republic.</p>
            <p>Some of the strongest critics of the emergent American culture always were to be found among Quakers
                    and by the 1830s and 1840s among the Hicksite Friends. Not surprisingly, Friends, together with some
                    New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> evangelicals, provided the society with its leaders and members and most of its energy
                    and principles. The founders were extreme indeed and indiscriminate in their questioning of
                    prevailing values and practices. They gave respectful heed to most of the reforms, great and small,
                    that in those years were entertained by the speculative.</p>
            <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-092-4-076"/>
            <p>The society's founders were closely associated with the most radical fringes of
                    abolitionism–not even William Lloyd Garrison outdid them in antislavery zeal. As
                    nonresistants, they renounced coercive earthly government in all its manifestations, relying instead
                    on their understanding of the Government of God. Retreating from the emergent competitive capitalism
                    of their day, they proposed an economy based on agricultural cooperation.</p>
            <p>Obviously, their aims in most respects ran counter to the forces that shaped the modern world, and
                    thus the society's efforts were doomed. Although their notions of possibility were
                    different from those of contemporary Americans, and although their solutions sometimes seem strange,
                    the record of their lives nevertheless offers fresh perspective on the present as well as on the
                    past and is therefore fully worthy of attention.</p>

            <p>As the Socialist Party of America's founder, organizational leader, perennial presidential
                    candidate, and principal spokesperson, Eugene V. Debs was American socialism's most public
                    face and gifted voice in the early twentieth century. Born and raised in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Debs came of age as the conflict between labor and capital was intensifying and vast
                    concentrations of economic power were calling into question the democratic promise of the American
                    experiment. He served in the local Democratic party and his town's lodge of the Brotherhood
                    of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen as a young man, counseling the harmony of labor and capital. Yet
                    by the early 1890s he had broken with the narrow, conservative craft union whose journal he edited
                    and formed an industrially organized, rival federation of railroad workers known as the American
                    Railway Union (ARU). In 1894, he threw his support behind the boycott of Pullman cars in the most
                    celebrated sympathy strike of the nineteenth century. Debs and his allies lost–the
                    American Federation of Labor did not join the boycott, the ARU was destroyed, Pullman workers went
                    down to painful defeat, and Debs landed in jail for violating a federal court injunction protecting
                    the company. By the end of the century, Debs had emerged as the leading figure in the growing
                    American socialist movement.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Gentle Rebel</hi> is a single-volume compilation of Debs's correspondence. It

                    1834-1945</hi>, which appeared in 1983. Designed to reach a more general audience than these larger
                    collections, the book omits significant annotation and includes a straightforward biographical
                    sketch (a shortened version of the introduction to the first volume of the <hi rend="i">Letters).</hi> Although the letters reprinted here span Debs's life, the nineteenth
                    century is given short shrift, while the decade and a half after 1910 receive the greatest
                    attention. Brief background statements provide minimal context for each letter. Debs and his
                    correspondents are allowed, to a large extent, to speak for themselves.</p>
            <p>The letters chosen here vividly bring to life important aspects of Debs's beliefs and
                    experiences. His speaking tours took him to hundreds of cities, where he mesmerized thousands of
                    crowds. Letter after letter reveals the physical toll exacted by such a schedule. "I am
                    willing to be killed for the cause but I don't want to die a fool's
                    death," an exhausted Debs confessed with annoyance in 1915 after an open buggy ride through
                    deep <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="idu">Idaho</region>
                    </placeName> snow that left him "half frozen, chilled to the marrow," his throat
                    raw and body aching. "Today I am unfit for anything…. Must I have such a damned
                    killing dose as [this] administered to me on every trip" (p. 96)? Debs nonetheless found
                    time to express his great love for literature and his appreciation of particular writers; among his
                    valued friends he included Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis, and Carl Sandburg. Glimpses of the
                    private Debs reveal his reliance upon and love for his brother (who for years served as his
                    secretary), his affection for Mabel Curry, and the tremendous passion behind Debs's
                    beliefs.</p>
            <p>Debs's correspondence with his friends, colleagues, opponents, and well-wishers also
                    illuminates his views on a vast range of political, social, moral, and intellectual issues.
                    Selections explore his staunch opposition to the intense factionalism that continually wracked the
                    Socialist party, his sharp differences with communists, his internationalism and principled
                    opposition to World War I, his hostility to prohibitionists, and his opposition to capital
                    punishment and restrictions on political expression in both the <placeName>

                        <country reg="-xxr">Soviet Union</country>
                    </placeName>. "If we … commit murder in the cause of justice, as the capitalists
                    do, we are not a damned bit better than they whose system we condemn as criminal and whose ethics we
                    renounce as barbarous and inhuman" (p. 210), he noted in reference to the Bolsheviks in
                    1922.</p>
            <p>What comes across least effectively, curiously, are the content and contours of Debs's
                    vision of socialism. Debs appears more the reformer–albeit with a distinct radical
                    vocabulary–than the revolutionary. If Debs "popularized ideas and ideals that
                    were denounced as radical, even un-American, early in the twentieth century," the editor
                    concludes, many of them "later became orthodox <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-092-4-078"/> and are
                    now viewed as traditional" (p. xxxviii). Yes, prohibition was repealed, but many of the
                    forces that Debs opposed survived and flourished. Capital punishment, heightened corporate power,
                    the dominance of the Democrats and Republicans, and persistent militarism –to name just a
                    few of the targets of Debs's ire–continue to loom large on the political
                    landscape. Debs's career was indeed "an honorable chapter in the history of
                    American dissent" (p. xxxviii), but it was also much more. The significance of
                    Debs's life lies less in the reforms he advocated and that American society eventually
                    adopted than in the sheer power of his indictment of American capitalism and his vision of a
                    socialist alternative, both of which were ultimately silenced.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Ernie Pyle in the American Southwest.</hi> By Richard Melzer. (Santa Fe, N.M.:
                    Sunstone Press, 1996. Pp. 176. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. Paperbound,
                    $18.95.)</head>
            <p>Ernie Pyle's image is fixed in the American imagination. His daily travel column, describing
                    people and places in an intimate and anecdotal style, brought pleasure to thousands of people in the
                    late 1930s. The friendly persona he created in that column, which set new standards for human
                    interest reporting, comforted Americans struggling through the Great Depression. Even more
                    remembered is his work in World War II when as the friend and reporter of the ordinary soldier he
                    became the most loved correspondent of the war. His unparalleled reputation among American
                    G.I.'s accords him a special place in the annals of journalism. Until he died a
                    soldier's death, the victim of sniper machine gun fire on the Pacific island Ie Shima near
                    Okinawa, he was, as Richard Melzer notes, the "infantry's Homer" and the
                    "G.I.'s Boswell" (p. 78). People of Indiana have long taken pride in the
                    fact that Pyle was one of their own, and there was much in his writings to justify that feeling.
                    Nevertheless, while Dana, Indiana, was Pyle's early home, Albuquerque, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>, became his adopted home later in life.</p>
            <p>Much of the last ten years of Pyle's life had a southwestern orientation. He and his wife
                    Jerry became attracted to the region after a trip there in 1935. In his own words, affection for the
                    Southwest was "like being in love with a woman…. You just love her because you
                    love her and you can't help yourself (p. 35). Melzer's purpose in writing this
                    volume was to provide a fuller description of Pyle's association with the Southwest,
                    especially <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-092-4-079"/>
            <p>Melzer develops that fuller description in a number of ways. He explores the reasons for
                    Pyle's settling in Albuquerque and the dimensions of his life there. The friendships he
                    made there, particularly that with Edward H. Shaffer, the editor of the Albuquerque <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>, form an interesting subtheme of the book. Beyond that Melzer explores the impact
                    that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> had on Pyle and the ways in which he influenced <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> and its citizens. These explorations represent the most original parts of the book, and
                    Melzer presents them in the context of Pyle's travels as a roving reporter and war
                    correspondent. Throughout the book, the author also underscores the interaction that existed between
                    Pyle's professional and private life.</p>
            <p>Melzer provides an interesting portrayal of Pyle's association with the Southwest and proves
                    that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> as well as Indiana is justified in celebrating his memory. The book merits attention
                    for this reason and because Melzer makes an interesting probe into Pyle's personal life. He
                    also accords Pyle's wife Jerry a prominent place in the book and treats her sad struggle
                    with mental depression and alcoholism in a sensitive and informed manner. Although previously
                    covered, Pyle's own mood swings and restlessness do not receive a similar in-depth
                    treatment. For a slim volume, however, this one is rich in intimate detail and reflects
                    Melzer's appreciated exploitation of personal paper collections and oral histories. He
                    achieved his goal in writing the book, but some readers will wish the book were more expansive.</p>

                    </placeName> were noted for their divided loyalties during the seventy years before the Civil War.
                    Beginning with the arrival of New Englanders in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the 1790s, the three states remained deeply divided until the Civil War brought a
                    measure of unity in defense of the Union. Nicole Etcheson has produced a brief and succinct
                    monograph in an effort to explain this phenomenon and in the process has helped show why these
                    residents of the Old Northwest were so often at odds with one another.</p>
            <pb n="370" id="VAA4025-092-4-080"/>
            <p>Etcheson keeps her focus on the upland southerners but cannot avoid an equal emphasis on those from
                    the Northeast who moved into the regions around the Great Lakes. Building on the work of other
                    historians who have attempted to explain the southern identification with democracy and independence
                    and the distaste for Yankee cultural imperialism, she adds little to earlier, more extensive
                    interpretations. She does, however, effectively bring together the issues that divided and united
                    residents and shows how most eventually came to view themselves as westerners.</p>
            <p>Etcheson, who is an assistant professor at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, El Paso, originally produced this study as a doctoral dissertation at Indiana
                    University. She has done an impressive and exhaustive job of research in primary materials,
                    including letters, editorials, petitions, speeches, diaries, and memoirs. She pieces together these
                    highly subjective accounts into an objective explanation of midwesterners' views. She notes
                    how each of the three territories fought for statehood as a kind of second war for independence,
                    their citizens overcoming the often tyrannical executive authority of territorial governors. Not
                    only was Arthur St. Clair viewed as an outsider by Ohioans, but even William Henry Harrison was seen
                    by many in southern Indiana as representing wealth and speculator influence at the expense of small
                    struggling farmers. Such governors sometimes were viewed as less manly than the honest
                    farmer/mechanic.</p>
            <p>Various economic and social issues made upland southerners suspicious of northeasterners, issues that
                    included internal improvements, land policy, public education, immigration, and temperance. Yet it
                    was slavery and the threatened presence of free blacks that most effectively united these settlers.
                    All who sought racial equality were seen as a threat to the position of whites. Rejecting the
                    extremes of abolitionism and secession, they sought a compromise stance, most frequently embodied in
                    the concept of popular sovereignty. The sectional crisis of the 1850s nonetheless challenged their
                    newborn status as midwesterners and brought a resurgence of sympathy for the South. Yet their hatred
                    of the wealthy planter aristocracy, who they believed had originally driven them from their southern
                    homes, meant that to most Abraham Lincoln had more appeal than Stephen A. Douglas. Few were willing
                    to surrender to southern demands in 1861, and they emerged from the war far more western than
                    southern, albeit with a persistent hint of distrust of New Englanders.</p>

            <p>To Latter-Day Saints of the 1840s, and to chroniclers of their experience ever since, Nauvoo, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, has represented many things. For those who lived in that <geogName>Mississippi
                    River</geogName> town during its Mormon heyday, it was a piece of Zion, a model of the Kingdom of
                    God foreseen by the prophet Joseph Smith. Historians, with their bent toward critical analysis, have
                    explicated the meaning of the place in more incisive terms. Ronald K. Esplin, for example,
                    identifies Nauvoo as <hi rend="i">"the</hi> city of Joseph," in which the Mormon
                    leader "fulfilled his religious mission" (p. 20). The author of the standard work
                    on the village, Robert Bruce Flanders, sees it as a "volatile mixture of elements"
                    that sparked "escalating violence within and without" (p. 231). And to the editors
                    of the present volume Nauvoo "is as much a state of mind as it is a physical
                    place." It embodies "a seedbed" where Mormonism took root and flowered,
                    "a refiner's fire" in which the early Saints not only faced opposition
                    but also "demonstrated their spiritual superiority" (p. 1).</p>
            <p>All these images find a place in this masterful collection. Here, in one volume, are fourteen of the
                    most significant historical studies of Mormon Nauvoo to appear in recent decades. Through careful
                    selection and skillful organization Roger D. Launius and John E. Hall was expose the readers to
                    articles that exhibit the multiple dimensions of the debate among students of Mormonism
                    "over the nature and purpose of historical inquiry" (p. 30). Though the essays are
                    largely representative of the "new Mormon history," with its stress on secular
                    scholarship and rationality, they remain sensitive to the assumptions of faith which shaped earlier
                    Mormon historiography. Taken together they also provide a highly informative guide to life in 1840s
                    Nauvoo.</p>
            <p>The result is a comprehensive picture of the Mormon "Kingdom on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>." Virtually every facet of the Nauvoo experience receives treatment: the
                    city's unique charter and the "state within a state" it created (p. 39);
                    the flexing of the Saints' military muscles through the Nauvoo Legion; the role of Joseph
                    Smith as prophet, entrepreneur, and politician; the divisive presence of the Mormon press and of
                    plural marriage; even the nature of recreation, occupation, and education in the town.</p>
            <p>While all of the entries are carefully researched and documented, several deserve special attention.
                    Kenneth W. Godfrey insightfully employs the methodology of Ferdinand Braudel in a cogent examination
                    of "the structures of everyday life" (p. 72) in Nauvoo, and Kathryn M. Daynes
                    delivers a persuasive argument <pb n="372" id="VAA4025-092-4-082"/> that Mormon polygamy emerged
                    there due to social anxieties produced by "severe environmental changes" (p. 131)
                    and to the Saints' unwavering loyalty to Joseph Smith. Equally valuable is the study,
                    contributed by Valeen Tippetts Avery and Linda King Newell, of the bitter conflict between Brigham
                    Young and Emma Smith and its impact on the Mormons' last days on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Likewise, editor Launius's account of the lessons Joseph Smith III learned in
                    Nauvoo, and later applied in launching the Reorganized Church, is a penetrating analysis of
                    leadership.</p>
            <p>Particularly helpful as well are forays into the nature and meaning of the prophet's vision
                    of a political kingdom of God by two of Mormonism's leading historians. Klaus J. Hansen
                    reminds us that "in history beliefs are as important as facts" (p. 63) and
                    proceeds to demonstrate how the Mormon belief structure led to an inevitable, and sometimes
                    hazardous, intertwining of politics and religion. Flanders agrees, artfully describing a
                    "politics of utopia" that ran amok because the prophet "was
                    simultaneously in the temple, … in the seat of government, in the land office, and on the
                    stump" (pp. 155-56). Another renowned Mormon scholar, though, is not as convincing. In his
                    investigation of whether there was "much that was religious in Nauvoo," Marvin S.
                    Hill contends that everything "of social or political nature" in the town was
                    "essentially religious" (pp. 120-21). Hill unfortunately applies a rather narrow
                    definition of religion, however, seeing it only as a quest for security and social
                    control–a startlingly negative assessment of religion's role in society and one
                    inadequately supported.</p>

            <p>Daniel Nelson's <hi rend="i">Farm and Factory</hi> provides a much-needed synthesis of
                    scholarship on the history of work and working people in the Midwest. Moreover, Nelson not only
                    synthesizes this scholarship but also uses it to advance several arguments about the distinctive
                    character of the Midwest. A volume in the Midwestern History and Culture series, edited by James H.
                    Madison and <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-092-4-083"/> Thomas J. Schlereth, this book should inform
                    historians of work, working people, and the Midwest for years to come and thus is a welcome
                    contribution. At the same time, it leaves the reader wanting a bit more.</p>
            <p>Nelson is very clear about his geographical and topical focus. He wishes to explore work broadly
                    defined, including–as his title indicates–labor in agriculture and industry;
                    he also devotes significant attention to white-collar workers. Though he says that he
                    "arbitrarily defined the Midwest as the states of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>" (p. vii), this sensible definition will seem arbitrary to very few readers.
                    Most important, Nelson presents a convincing thesis: "the essential feature of the
                    region's labor history that set it apart from other American regions was the sustained,
                    simultaneous growth of agriculture and industry, a feature that produced notable patterns of
                    individual mobility and that left a distinctive and inescapable heritage" (p. vii).</p>
            <p>The rapid, simultaneous growth of agriculture and industry, Nelson argues, created two work forces:
                    one primarily native and agrarian, the other primarily urban and immigrant. The shift of labor from
                    farm to factory, a feature of the economic and social history of other regions, did not occur in the
                    Midwest until after World War II. A combination of resources, location, and opportunity made the
                    region a center of innovative practices in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
                    Another distinctive regional feature was the strength of workers'
                    "voice." Through unions, politics, and farmers' groups, working people
                    played an unusually large role in the region's economic history. Together, these factors
                    created in the Midwest a unique pattern of work and employment that produced prosperity and
                    stability. By the post-World War II years, however, the innovative methods of scientific agriculture
                    and mass production, upon which the region's prosperity was built, had ceased to be new,
                    and no comparable innovations succeeded them; the relatively underdeveloped service sector failed to
                    provide sufficient alternative economic opportunities to compensate. The collapse of industry and
                    agriculture in the region from the 1960s on represented both a consequence of this pattern and an
                    end of it. By the 1980s the region was suffering its most severe crisis since the Great Depression,
                    and there were visible only the barest outlines of a new, emerging structure of work and
                    opportunity.</p>
            <p>Clearly a brief review cannot do justice to an interpretation of such complexity. Nelson builds his
                    arguments on an impressively broad reading of the literature on midwestern history; historians will
                    find his notes a rich resource. The reliance on secondary sources means that those who have studied
                    the history of workers <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-092-4-084"/> or agriculture in the Midwest will find
                    much that is familiar, though they often will see familiar stories integrated into new patterns.
                    Suggestions for further research abound, as, for example, in the treatment of company unions as more
                    varied, and at times more influential and reflective of the worker's voice, than
                    conventional explanations allow.</p>
            <p>Of necessity, a work of this type must omit much. Perhaps of necessity, the texture and drama of the
                    lives of working people are largely invisible here. Aside from a handful of national figures, few
                    individual lives appear (and those only briefly). While Nelson effectively integrates the findings
                    of the past generation of labor and social historians, treating briefly such topics as ethnic
                    communities and workplace culture, there is little discussion of the efforts of working people to
                    create meaningful lives. Even events like the region's major strikes come across as
                    surprisingly colorless. Nor is the devastation brought by the past generation's economic
                    changes really evident. Few readers new to the history of work and working people will sense the
                    drama and excitement of the field.</p>
            <p>Less of necessity than by choice, Nelson does not address some broader questions. The book tells the
                    story of a region whose people played the game properly. Hard-working and innovative, the
                    generations described in this book created a regional economy of incredible productivity: midwestern
                    fields and factories were the envy of the world, bringing prosperity to millions and playing a
                    crucial role in the nation's economic development. Yet just a generation or so after this
                    system had reached maturity, it fell apart. While Nelson offers some interesting tentative thoughts
                    about the region's future prospects, he provides little comment on what one is to make of
                    the midwestern experience. From industrial heartland to rust belt in a generation–how
                    could such a seemingly solid economic base turn out to have been so fragile? What does this
                    region's experience offer to those who want to build stable, sustainable economies? Indeed,
                    what is one to make of an economic system that devastates regions in this way? Given
                    Nelson's deep understanding of economics, work, and workers, one wishes he had chosen to
                    offer the reader his thoughts on these matters.</p>
            <p>In fairness, though, in a book of this type the author is not obligated to address such questions.
                        <hi rend="i">Farm and Factory</hi> fulfills its purpose admirably: it provides an insightful,
                    wide-ranging look at work and workers in the Midwest. It will certainly be a basic resource on
                    regional history for years to come, as well as a book that adds to our broader understanding of the
                    nation's labor and economic history.</p>

            <p>Mary Neth's <hi rend="i">Preserving the Family Farm</hi>, an eloquently written and
                    extensively researched study of community and family farm survival strategies from 1900 to 1940,
                    places gender at the center of the historical analysis. Neth includes data from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>, <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
               </placeName>, and South Dakota, but her research deals primarily with dairy
                    farming in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and, to a lesser degree, corn and livestock farming in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> and wheat farming in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>
                    </placeName>. Although Neth offers some insightful comparisons based on differences in commodity
                    specializations and geography, many of her regional generalizations rest heavily on evidence from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, particularly on the diaries of Anna Pratt Erickson. On balance, however,
                    Neth's ambitious book succeeds in placing individual and local experiences within the
                    context of the larger region and in juxtaposition to government policies.</p>
            <p>Despite technological changes and government policies that fostered farm consolidation and increased
                    production, Neth argues, the years between 1900 and 1940 constituted a period of flux in the rural
                    Midwest rather than one of steady change from traditional to modern practices. Farm families
                    "adopted, adapted, and resisted" new technologies and methods while continuing to
                    rely on traditional patterns of family and neighborhood mutuality (p. 121). Since men held property
                    and were the heads of families, women "had the most to gain within the family by
                    emphasizing the mutuality of family labor and the farm enterprise" (p. 18). After detailing
                    the integration of men's and women's gender-specific tasks in the productive work
                    of family farms, Neth demonstrates how mutuality also characterized neighborhood and community
                    patterns of social and economic sharing and reciprocity. Through the 1930s exchanges of products and
                    labor in gendered networks within rural neighborhoods were essential for the survival of small
                    family farms; families outside neighborhood networks had the most trouble staying in farming.
                    Exclusion, Neth posits, was the flip side of cooperation, and "length of residence,
                    economic or tenure status, ethnicity, religion, race often created barriers that farm people did not
                    attempt to cross" (p. 71). Her balanced handling of these variables suggests, however, that
                    barriers could be overcome and did not always preclude formation of diverse coalitions of rural
                    people.</p>
            <p>Neth joins several scholars in sharply criticizing <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Department of Agriculture policies and agricultural and home economics extension
                    programs that "placed family and community <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-092-4-086"/> needs into
                    a separate ‘women's sphere,’ and then devalued them by subordinating
                    social and family concerns to economic production– the ‘business’
                    of farming" (p. 5). Professionals concerned with social and economic problems of rural
                    families lacked status in government agencies and academic institutions that placed higher value on
                    the scientific and commercial aspects of agriculture. Insecure themselves, they did little to
                    counter the dominant agribusiness orientation of policymakers and often joined in denigrating
                    farmers who did not adopt progressive methods as "backward" and farm women who
                    labored both on the farm and in the home as "drudges." Neth argues that women had
                    the most to lose in the eventual triumph of agribusiness in the post–World War II period.
                    Changes in marketing and agricultural production, she explains, eliminated women's economic
                    base on family farms and "they became more like their urban counterparts, contributing
                    wages and unpaid household labor to the family economy" (p. 241-42). By terminating her
                    study in 1940, Neth illuminates the persistence of traditional survival strategies in the midst of
                    change but leaves the reader longing for similarly deft analysis of the crucial war years.
                    Nonetheless, this is an ambitious and important study that provides a valuable analytical framework
                    and raises countless questions for more detailed examinations of twentieth-century rural change in
                    individual midwestern states.</p>

                    </placeName> from 1958 to 1976. A liberal Democrat, he served during the most important period of
                    legislative social reform after World War II, a period that also was one of social and political
                    upheaval. Hart was, in addition, one of the most influential legislators, earning the respect and
                    then admiration of both constituents and colleagues for his intellect, humility, compassion, quiet
                    congeniality, and formidable tenacity. Senator Edward Kennedy said, "he was like a brother
                    to me." Before his death from cancer during his last year in office, his colleagues voted
                    to name the new Senate office building for him.</p>

                    eight children. Hart entered politics at the local level after discovering that practicing law was
                    not fulfilling. After serving as <placeName>

                    the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also was responsible for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965
                    and the establishment of the Sleeping Bear Dunes national lakeshore.</p>
            <p>A thoughtful individual who experienced bouts of depression, he could see both sides of an issue with
                    ease. His foremost concern was that the power centers of America, the corporations and government,
                    had lost contact with the average American and were thus thwarting democracy. He felt that if the
                    federal government acted properly on behalf of the consumer, racial minorities, and the poor, it
                    could restore the balance and at the same time fend off communism abroad. In the event, of course,
                    this was a huge challenge that in addition to social reform resulted in racial turmoil and the

                    organized, and engaging. The author allows his subject's life to unfold and provides a

            <p>Maurice G. Baxter has performed a valuable service to American historians by compiling this brief
                    history of Henry Clay's promotion of his "American System" for national
                    economic development. Although <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s pet project has earned due attention from historians of the nineteenth
                    century, a monograph focused specifically on the issue has been long overdue.</p>
            <p>Naturally, historians have devoted enormous attention to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s career and political philosophy. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> statesman has been the subject of a number of excellent biographies as well as a
                    leading character in other histories of the period. Perhaps the <pb n="378" id="VAA4025-092-4-088"/>
                    "Great Compromiser's" contributions in resolving various sectional
                    disputes (in 1820, 1833, and 1850) have received the greatest attention, but his Whiggish
                    prescription for national economic progress has not been shortchanged.</p>
            <p>Despite this previous work, Baxter presents new information about <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s economic agenda and in the process manages to offer new insights about <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> the politician and the man. Of course, there are numerous details about how <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> formulated and promoted his program for economic expansion. Serious readers will
                    probably enjoy yet another rendition of the debates over tariff policy and internal improvements
                    and, not least, another account of the Bank War. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s efforts during the Nullification Crisis, his battle with John Tyler, and his
                    unsuccessful presidential campaigns are also analyzed.</p>
            <p>Often, a familiar story well told brings renewed satisfaction. Yet Baxter's version of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s record is not at all dated. He presents, for example, an updated view of the
                    Panic of 1837. Baxter is especially adept at showing the evolution of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s positions; oftentimes <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s personal experiences in raising hemp or traveling over bumpy roads provided
                    convincing justification for his favored proposals.</p>

                    </placeName> partisans may not find their hero celebrated as much as expected. Indeed, Baxter can be
                    rather hard on the famous Kentuckian, albeit not because of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s position on black bondage or sectional politics. The portrait presented is
                    not that of a careful, calculating politician. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> is criticized for lacking "practical statesmanship" (p. 107) during
                    the Bank War with Andrew Jackson and likewise scored for his dictatorial stance opposite Tyler
                    (although Baxter also admits that Tyler too was out of touch). At times Baxter verges on presenting <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> as a committed ideologue and a somewhat naive one at that!</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s economic nationalism certainly warrants the closer look Baxter provides.
                    While little revolutionary material may be revealed, the author successfully refines our view of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s program and his participation in Jacksonian-era political disputes.
                    Undoubtedly a labor of love, this well-researched and well-argued volume deserves a careful reading.</p>

            <p>One of the most exciting recent developments in black history and women's studies is the
                    scholarly interest in Sojourner Truth. It is about time that a historiography developed on this
                    fascinating, <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-092-4-089"/> unlettered nineteenth-century black activist,
                    whose words and deeds have been embraced by present-day Americans but unscrutinized for accuracy or
                    authenticity. In 1993, Carleton Mabee published the first scholarly biography of Truth (<hi rend="i">Sojourner Truth: Slave, Prophet, Legend)</hi>, and I published the first annotated version of
                    Truth's slave narrative with a modern, contextual introduction (<hi rend="i">The Narrative
                        of Sojourner Truth).</hi> Erlene Stetson and Linda David's <hi rend="i">Glorying in
                        Tribulation</hi> is the third effort to offer a scholarly treatment of Truth. It has been
                    followed this year by Nell I. Painter's biography (<hi rend="i">Sojourner Truth: A Life, A
                        Symbol).</hi> My own Truth biography will appear at some future date.</p>
            <p>Readers might wonder about duplication as well as overlap. Mabee's dry, detailed biography
                    covered important events in Truth's life and took a fact versus fiction approach. It was
                    meant to dispel "myths" about Truth canonized by modern feminists. Stetson and
                    David's construction of Truth illustrates the range of interpretation that her life
                    invites. <hi rend="i">Glorying in Tribulation</hi> is refreshing and interesting because the authors
                    write with sensitivity, offer some critical analysis, and place Truth in a context of
                    women's activism.</p>
            <p>"Sojourner" is loosely constructed by the authors as a black female torchbearer of
                    struggle. Biographically, the authors cover the same ground as Mabee with less thoroughness and no
                    new evidence. Their most challenging analysis is their defense of the authenticity of Frances
                    Gage's "Ain't I A Woman" speech, which Mabee relegates to
                    "folklore" and Nell Painter and I at least call into question. The authors have a
                    good chapter on Truth's contributions to black struggle during and following the Civil War
                    yet end with an uncohesive chapter on the suffrage issue. Furthermore, the authors'
                    innovative perspective in assessing Truth's womanist politics is greatly weakened by a
                    failure to discuss the famous Indiana confrontation over her sexuality and to analyze the politics
                    of the black female body.</p>
            <p>The lack of a preface, introduction, and epilogue indicates not only structural formlessness but
                    confusion as to the authors' objectives. Nevertheless, <hi rend="i">Glorying in

                    Series, which in a few <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-092-4-090"/> years has distinguished itself for its
                    short, readable, up-to-date syntheses of monographic literature. Like its companion, J. Matthew
                    Gallman's <hi rend="i">The North Fights the Civil War</hi> (1994), <hi rend="i">To <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                        </placeName> and Beyond</hi> also contributes its own arguments to the literature it
                    synthesizes. Furthermore, it is one of the few books that puts together soldiers'
                    experiences during the war with veterans' experiences afterward.</p>
            <p>In his treatment of the war itself, Logue is most influenced by Gerald Linderman's <hi rend="i">Embattled Courage</hi> (1987), although there are a number of references to my own
                    work. Logue, however, distinguishes more between Union and Confederate soldiers'
                    experiences than has been customary in the literature.</p>
            <p>Logue is more careful to put the soldier's experience of war into the context of a changing
                    society than are many of the studies he synthesizes. He sees self-control, inculcated by a
                    modernizing northern society, as the essential cultural value of many northern soldiers. To this he
                    contrasts a southern ethos in which honor and feeling play a greater role. His characterization of
                    the importance of self-control among northerners is convincing, but self-control may have been
                    equally important among Confederate soldiers.</p>
            <p>Logue's portrayal of the postwar years accents the differences between North and South even
                    more. He argues that Confederate veterans, through organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and the
                    Democratic party, had more influence on the South than the Union veterans had on the country as a
                    whole. He sees the latter group's influence on politics as limited primarily to the issue
                    of pensions. While this might have been the case, it seems that Logue's argument might also
                    reflect the state of the literature on the postwar period more than reality. Oddly, the
                    "Lost Cause" has been far more studied than what might be called the "Won
                    Cause." For a generation the Republican party called on veterans to vote as they shot, and
                    it is not clear in what ways veterans <hi rend="i">as citizens</hi> as compared to a special
                    interest group might have felt slighted by the political process.</p>
            <p>Along with his mastery of the secondary literature, Logue's raising of issues for debate is
                    his great strength. Scholars studying Civil War soldiers and veterans have been reluctant so far to
                    admit the disagreements among them, let alone address those disagreements. Logue's splendid
                    book should go a long way to reinvigorate the field.</p>

            <p>In this carefully crafted, engaging, and well-written book, John Dittmer demonstrates an enviable
                    grasp of detail and nuance. This he uses to reveal important and often overlooked or understated
                    aspects of the civil rights movement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and the nation.</p>
            <p>Parts of this story are familiar and appear in most civil rights narratives: Robert Moses moving
                    alone into McComb, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1961; the deaths of James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman; and the
                    emergence of Fannie Lou Hamer as a national spokesperson at the 1964 Democratic convention. Yet,
                    from beginning to end, Dittmer consistently re-situates and provides context for these more familiar
                    narratives through his focus on the work of local people and their allies, primarily the Student
                    Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). For example,
                    Dittmer devotes only two of eighteen chapters to the 1964 Freedom Summer and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Freedom Democratic Party challenge in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlantic City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, topics that typically dominate discussions of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> movement. Here, the story of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> movement is far more than the several-month period when hundreds of white volunteers
                    flooded the state.</p>
            <p>Dittmer begins the story in July, 1946, with Medgar Evers leading fellow World War II veterans in an
                    unsuccessful attempt to vote in the Democratic primary and ends roughly forty years later with the
                    seating of a black-led delegation from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> in the 1968 Democratic convention. With both its emphases and time frame dictated by
                    the people and events within the state, <hi rend="i">Local People</hi> provides a wonderful
                    alternative to the more common national orientation of civil rights historiography, which tends to
                    center on leaders, organizations, and legislation. The result is more than a longer story or a more
                    diverse focus.</p>
            <p>In his examination of the widespread, grassroots effort in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, Dittmer exposes themes that are absent from other civil rights works. He describes the
                    day-in and day-out organizing of SNCC and CORE activists who moved in for the long haul and made
                    their homes with and found allies in local women and men. He explores the cooperation and common
                    vision of a wide array of individuals and groups as well as intergroup tensions and rivalries
                    (particularly between the national NAACP and the homegrown Council of Federated Organizations or
                    COFO). Perhaps even more telling is his account of the promises and the pitfalls found in the
                    interaction among the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> movement, the federal government, and the liberal wing of the Democratic party.</p>
            <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-092-4-092"/>
            <p>After skillfully and sensitively portraying years of courage, hope, and hard work, along with
                    disappointment, resistance, and betrayal, and yet more courage and hope, Dittmer closes with
                    comments by activist Bob Moses. The movement, Moses said, "brought <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, for better or worse, up to the level of the rest of the country" (pp.
                    429-30).</p>
            <p>Dittmer's focus on local people and local priorities in this absorbing account brings the <placeName>

                    </placeName> movement to the rest of us. It should be read by anyone interested in the civil rights
                    movement. Moreover, <hi rend="i">Local People</hi> will be one of the books that reshapes the way
                    historians view the civil rights movement as the cumulative weight of local studies challenges the
                    dominant national perspective on the movement's importance.</p>

                    </placeName>'s seven coal-mining counties, the War on Poverty lost its momentum during the
                    oil crisis <hi rend="i">cum</hi> coal boom that began in 1973. But since the early 1980s and the
                    return of stable oil imports, coal mining layoffs have snowballed and a new wave of grassroots
                    organizing has been under way.</p>
            <p>At first, that new wave was best symbolized by the Dungannon Development Commission (DDC), an
                    organization based in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Scott County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and intent on promoting poor people's empowerment–especially poor
                    women's empowerment–by combining GED programs and specially designed community
                    college courses with income generating projects, particularly cooperatives. The DDC's
                    greatest success was probably its Coal Employment Project, which fought both coal companies and male
                    miners' traditional <hi rend="i">machismo</hi> to help women achieve high-paying
                    underground jobs. In 1987, following much favorable publicity, the DDC received a large federal
                    grant to create a sewing cooperative, but internal power struggles for control of that project
                    lowered the morale of all concerned.</p>
            <p>Later, a less dramatic and more communal effort achieved greater success: the Ivanhoe Civic League
                    based in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wythe County</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and led by a charismatic local woman named Maxine Waller. But meanwhile the highly
                    abrasive 1989-1990 strike by the United Mine Workers (UMW) against Pittston Coal Company temporarily
                    propelled thousands of people into local activism.</p>
            <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-092-4-093"/>
            <p>Into that heady flux stepped the author of this book, a sympathetic scholar interested in how
                    political activism can change women's lives. Seitz conducted lengthy interviews with about
                    twelve active women, and she makes no secret of her sympathy for those women. The bulk of
                    Seitz's book is a valuable selection of quotations from her interviewees, quotations that
                    she has organized into six thematic chapters ("Family," "Work,"
                    "Community," etc.) and that she controls within a generally impressive feminist
                    interpretation.</p>
            <p>Each of Seitz's interviewees has, or has had, men intimately involved in her life. Here
                    those men do not receive equal time–nor any time at all. About half of the interviewees
                    report major mistreatment by men in their past personal lives. Thus the absence here of male
                    testimony may be partly unavoidable. But just as the men in these women's personal lives
                    lack a voice here, likewise do the managers of coal companies and of garment factories and other
                    adversaries of Seitz's interviewees–they too appear only through the
                    women's testimony. Even leaders of the UMW come in for censure. Early during the
                    UMW's strike against Pittston, the union leaders authorized a much-publicized
                    "Camp Solidarity" for visiting sympathizers. The UMW also authorized a Family
                    Auxiliary to monitor local community interests. Among the women whom Seitz interviewed were several
                    auxiliary members who came to "feel that the union ‘sold them out’ in
                    its need for a victory in Southwest <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>: ‘All they really wanted was a contract that they could say was won with the
                    strike,’ was a comment from a fiercely pro-labor member [of the Auxiliary]. Many men have
                        <hi rend="i">not</hi> returned to work and more and more men are losing their jobs" (p.
                    176).</p>
            <p>Despite the absence of male voices, management voices, or union leaders' voices,
                    Seitz's book is valuable as direct testimony by women who are in the midst of
                    social–and personal–transformations. As for Seitz's interpretation,
                    that cannot fully receive justice in this short review. The best-known of her favorite authorities
                    are Paulo Freire (<hi rend="i">Pedagogy of the Oppressed</hi>, 1970), James C. Scott (<hi rend="i">Weapons of the Weak</hi>, 1985), Jaqueline Dowd Hall on "Disorderly Women,"
                    and Lydia Sargent on "the unhappy marriage of Marxism and feminism."</p>
            <p>This is a welcome book that is basically political but that could point its author, if she chooses,
                    toward a fully-elaborated theory of personal transformation through social activism.</p>
