                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as

                        <l>Oh Lionel, you look</l>
                        <l>So strangely at me. Think, I all alone,</l>
                        <l>So many reasons, all my friends so fain,</l>
                        <l>My mother pressing me, Sir Joyce so good,</l>
                        <l>So full of promises, he who could choose</l>
                        <l>No bride among the highest ladies round</l>
                        <l>But she would smile elate and all her kin</l>
                        <l>Bow low and thank him and go swelled with prideâ</l>
                        <l>You cannot wonder that my friends declare</l>
                        <l>Theyâll hear no Noes, but force me to my good.</l>

                        <l>When first I heard this lieâI called it so</l>
                        <l>In anger for you, I will call it so,</l>
                        <l>Though your lips contradict me, till the last</l>

                        <l>Worst proof have sworn it other, âtis so strange,</l>
                        <l>So recklessly untrue to that pure self</l>
                        <l>Of my love EleanorâWhen first I heard</l>
                        <l>That lie on you, as if you, a young thing</l>
                        <l>In the bud of stainless girlhood, you the like</l>
                        <l>Of babies in your fond grave innocence,</l>
                        <l>You proud as maidens are who do not know</l>
                        <l>What sin and weariness is like in lives</l>
                        <l>Smirched by the pitch that seethes, theyâve told you, far</l>
                        <l>From your balmâscenting nostrils, but perceive</l>
                        <l>Yourselves are as the high accessless snows</l>
                        <l>Whose blushings do but prove their perfect white,</l>
                        <l>And so look coldly down on something base,</l>
                        <l>You know not what, beneath youâyou whose smiles</l>
                        <l>Are gladder than most laughters, and whose voice</l>
                        <l>Rings like the wild birdsâ singing in the wood,</l>
                        <l>Because you are so young and new in heart,</l>
                        <l>You who to meâ</l>
                        <l>But say, to put the least,</l>
                        <l>You, the Miss Vaughan we men agree to think</l>
                        <l>Worth anyhow such common reverence</l>
                        <l>As good girls like our sisters have from usâ</l>
                        <l>That you were bought like any lower thing</l>
                        <l>Our CrÅsus fancies, like the horse that won</l>
                        <l>The Derby last, the picture of the year,</l>
                        <l>The best bred pointer, or the costliest ring;</l>
                        <l>You bought by such a buyer, a cold fool</l>
                        <l>Whose very vices, like his polished airs,</l>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7196-007"/>
                        <l>His tastes and smallâtalk, were acquired by dint</l>
                        <l>Of callous perseverance; one whoâll own,</l>
                        <l>With a feigned yawn, heâs something bored with life,</l>
                        <l>Meaning by life stale sins and selfishness;</l>
                        <l>A dried up pithless soul, who, having lacked</l>

                        <l>Now lacks the courage to be oldâYou bought</l>
                        <l>For laces, diamonds, a conspicuous seat</l>
                        <l>In country ballârooms, footmen, carriages,</l>
                        <l>A house in town and so onâand no doubt</l>
                        <l>Most liberal settlements, that is but just.</l>
                        <l>A man past youth and practised out of tune</l>
                        <l>For loving should not haggle at the price</l>
                        <l>When he buys girlhood, blushes, sentiment,</l>
                        <l>Grace, innocence, aye even piety</l>
                        <l>And taste in decking churches, such fawn eyes</l>
                        <l>As yours are, Eleanor, and such a bloom</l>
                        <l>Of an unfingered peach just newly ripe.</l>
                        <l>Aye, when a modest woman sells herself</l>
                        <l>Like an immodest one, she should not find</l>
                        <l>A niggard at the cheque book.</l>
                        <l>Eleanor,</l>
                        <l>Can I not <emph>taunt</emph> you even to a no?</l>
                        <l>Look up; defend yourself. Oh! you sit there</l>
                        <l>Languid and still, and grow a little pale,</l>
                        <l>And flush a little, and will not reply</l>
                        <l>Even by a look. Be angry with me, child,</l>
                        <l>Cry out that I misjudge you to my shame;</l>

                        <l>Say I, like a rough lawyer, questioned you</l>
                        <l>Into a maze, and twisted me a yes</l>
                        <l>Out of your shifting coil of noes, while you</l>
                        <l>Were dimly pondering what I asked. Speak, speak;</l>
                        <l>Say anything, but do not let me break</l>
                        <l>My passion on you while you droop and give</l>
                        <l>Like a rockârooted seaweed in the surf.</l>
                        <l>Say anything, except that I do well</l>
                        <l>To speak to you as I have spoken now.</l>

                        <l>I, who have gladly let you give me praise</l>
                        <l>Far past my merit in the foolish time</l>
                        <l>When I believed I could grow like your praise</l>
                        <l>Must bear in patience now if you give blame</l>

                        <l>Yes, that was long ago before I knew</l>
                        <l>I could be <emph>tempted</emph> even to do wrong.</l>
                        <l>You know my boast was that I never broke</l>
                        <l>The lightest merry promise. Long ago</l>
                        <l>I could be proud.</l>

                    <sp>
                        <speaker>Lionel.</speaker>
                        <l>Be proud again, my love,</l>
                        <l>My Eleanor! I know you are yourself</l>
                        <l>When you speak so. Be proud again, too proud</l>
                        <l>Not to atone. Stay, shall I tell you, dear,</l>
                        <l>How I received the tidings that Miss Vaughan</l>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7196-009"/>
                        <l>Was pricked for Lady Boycott? Why, I laughed,</l>
                        <l>Laughed, Eleanor, as any schoolboy might</l>
                        <l>Who heard his awful doctor had been caught</l>
                        <l>Picking a small boyâs pocket for his pence.</l>
                        <l>It was not long ago. Young Polwarth came</l>
                        <l>To town, dined with me at our club, and there</l>
                        <l>Tossed out his precious news quite innocent</l>
                        <l>Of where it touched. âMiss Vaughan!â I laughed, âThe joke</l>
                        <l>Is too farâfetched. You do not know her well.â</l>
                        <l>Till he, abashed, recanted, âWell, no doubt</l>
                        <l>The rumour is not true; but so it runs.â</l>
                        <l>And later that same evening Pringle came,</l>
                        <l>And heâI think he knew he stung meâyes</l>
                        <l>Heâd guessed why his sweet speeches forced a clash</l>
                        <l>Of discord in your ears, where other words</l>
                        <l>Were making your love musicâhe was loud</l>
                        <l>With the same story. âAye,â he said, âsheâs wise,</l>
                        <l>That coy Miss Eleanor, she knows her worth.</l>
                        <l>All very well to lure on you or me</l>
                        <l>With her odd ways, half peacock and half dove,</l>
                        <l>Strutting and cooingâbut, for marriage, why</l>
                        <l>We come to business then. Sheâs a shrewd girl.â</l>
                        <l>And <emph>he</emph> would not recant: heâd swear âtwas true.</l>
                        <l>But I said, âYouâd not play foolâs trumpeter</l>
                        <l>To the idiot gossips who invent such trash:</l>
                        <l>No surely: You and I both know her well.â</l>
                        <l>And, Eleanor, even now I say to you,</l>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7196-010"/>
                        <l>It is not trueâI know it who know you.</l>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>Eleanor.</speaker>
                        <l>Yes long ago you knew me, but not now.</l>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>Lionel.</speaker>
                        <l>And when was long ago? A second time</l>
                        <l>You talk of long ago. Not three months past</l>
                        <l>Since we last parted, and I took your word</l>
                        <l>Of sorrowâsweet good bye away with me</l>
                        <l>To be my sweetest memory, and thought,</l>
                        <l>âI shall succeed because she loves me so,â</l>
                        <l>And turned me to my crabbed toil, as if</l>
                        <l>It had been some romance of a true love</l>
                        <l>That thrills the reader throughâsome rare romance</l>
                        <l>With your name in it, Eleanor, and mine,</l>
                        <l>And a glad end. You call this long ago,</l>
                        <l>And I still live in it, live in the life</l>
                        <l>Your loveâthe dream of your love was it?âgave.</l>
                        <l>What long ago? Not all a year by days</l>
                        <l>Has passed since first a sudden moment broke</l>
                        <l>My silenceâours. You looked me a reproach,</l>
                        <l>Not knowing how you looked, how pleadingly,</l>
                        <l>For a light word I spokeâas a man speaks</l>
                        <l>Who plays with his own heart and pricks at it</l>
                        <l>To prove because he laughs it does not feelâ</l>
                        <l>A jest as if I thought gay scorn of love</l>
                        <l>And prized a woman as we prize a rose,</l>
                        <l>Meaning all roses and the one in hand,</l>
                        <l>All liked with just a difference for taste</l>
                        <l>In perfumes and in tints. You looked at me:</l>
                        <l>And I at you. How could I help it, child?</l>

                        <l>I had remembered on for weeks and months</l>
                        <l>That I was a poor man and should not speak,</l>
                        <l>But I forgot it just a moment long,</l>
                        <l>Because you had forgotten, and my eyes,</l>
                        <l>Hungry for one love look, met yours so full</l>
                        <l>That you grew red and trembled, and I knew</l>
                        <l>In a quick impulse that you were my own,</l>
                        <l>And that I had no life which was not you.</l>
                        <l>And I said, breathlessâwhat, I do not know,</l>
                        <l>But something that meant âlove me,â and you raised</l>
                        <l>Your quivering face with a strange radiance on it</l>
                        <l>Of tenderness and promise and grave joy,</l>
                        <l>And looked into my eyes, and said no word,</l>
                        <l>But laid your hand in mine. And then you wept</l>
                        <l>Becauseââtwas you that said it, Eleanorâ</l>
                        <l>Because you were so happy. And I drew</l>
                        <l>Your head against my breast, and whispered âwife,â</l>
                        <l>And youâoh sweet and simply loving girl</l>
                        <l>And naturalâyou put your lips to mine</l>
                        <l>And kissed me. Oh! my wife that was to be,</l>
                        <l>My Eleanor, was that day long ago,</l>
                        <l>That day which always is my yesterday?</l>

                        <l>No, no, you must not talk to me of that,</l>
                        <l>You must not. There are things one must forgetâ</l>
                        <l>One should at least. But ah! it is so hard.</l>
                        <l>One must be happier than I can be</l>
                        <l>To be able to forget past happiness.</l>
                        <l>But, Lionel, what you call yesterday</l>

                        <l>I know not when. Ah! surely yesterday</l>
                        <l>Is long ago when all its hopes are dead,</l>
                        <l>And Eleanor is dead who lived in it</l>
                        <l>And loved youâoh <emph>did</emph> love you. Do not think</l>
                        <l>I am all heartless. I <emph>did</emph> love you more</l>

                        <l>Let me go,</l>

                        <l>Youâll keep your faith. You dare not say again</l>

                        <l>With another kind of pain. But bye and bye</l>
                        <l>I shall grow used to it. It means, you know,</l>
                        <l>My fetter to the husâ to him, Sir Joyce,</l>

                        <l>It <emph>is</emph> his for the moment. It was mine</l>

                        <l>Sir, though I have done wrong to you,</l>
                        <l>And so have humbled me before your scoffs,</l>
                        <l>I am a woman, as I think, not like</l>
                        <l>To fall short of my duty as a wife.</l>
                        <l>Be sure Sir Joyce will have his due from me.</l>

                        <l>Yes, crane your neck in the old way, flash down</l>
                        <l>Superb bright scorning from your hooded eyes.</l>
                        <l>Wifeâs duty, yes, youâll never shame that, child;</l>
                        <l>Youâll make this sin of yours shine out at last</l>
                        <l>Like virtue by your married perfectness.</l>
                        <l>I can believe it. But youâd make me laugh,</l>
                        <l>Wereât not for shuddering that you are so fooled</l>
                        <l>To your blind venture by a moral shred</l>
                        <l>Of heartlessness. âKind husbands make good wives,</l>
                        <l>And good wives love their husbandsââvery sageâ</l>
                        <l>And prudent mothers preach it to their girls,</l>
                        <l>And the pith of it is âDo not choose by love,</l>
                        <l>But look to means; because a man whoâs poor</l>
                        <l><emph>Must</emph> be unkind, for want of cash to spend</l>
                        <l>Upon his wife.â And so youâre all agreed,</l>
                        <l>You and your family, Sir Joyce will be</l>
                        <l>A model husband, (heâs so rich), and make,</l>

                        <l>The typed good wife of you. But do you think,</l>
                        <l>You who at least have known that loving means</l>
                        <l>A something more than Thank yous, than replies</l>
                        <l>Of a civil sort, and easy going smiles,</l>
                        <l>And a fattening placid womanly goodwill</l>

                        <l>To cheat your heart with such a dull content,</l>
                        <l>And be at rest and bask? You, Eleanor!</l>
                        <l>Youâll pine to love as a caged sparrow pines</l>
                        <l>To fly, youâll tear and break your useless wings</l>
                        <l>With beating at the bars, or else youâll mope</l>
                        <l>In obstinate tired stillness; youâll not thrive</l>
                        <l>On caged birdsâ food, and sing. Oh! you are mad.</l>
                        <l>You do not know yourself. Oh! child, be warned.</l>
                        <l>Why will you curse your youth with such a life?</l>
                        <l>Nay, let me speak to youâlet me speak still.</l>
                        <l>I have not spoken to you of myself:</l>

                        <l>What a poor quivering wretch a man may be</l>
                        <l>Before the little blow from a light hand</l>
                        <l>That breaks his heart: I dared not even say</l>
                        <l>âTis something hard on me,â lest I should bare</l>
                        <l>A foolish throbbing anguish for myself</l>
                        <l>âTwere fitter to keep hidden, and should shock</l>
                        <l>Your cold ear with such outcry for the pain</l>
                        <l>As shames a man. But I will tell you once</l>
                        <l>Because, since you still love me, I believe</l>
                        <l>It may a little move you, I endure</l>

                        <l>And lecture coldly on it, I might speak</l>
                        <l>In sober phrases and set out my grief</l>

                        <l>Has won my parents withâand almost me.</l>
                        <l>Ah! love, I have been weak. You were away.</l>
                        <l>And I was flattered. And I had gone far</l>
                        <l>Before I knew where I was being led.</l>
                        <l>It seemed too late at last. But I am yours:</l>
                        <l>I have come back to you. Yes I will wait</l>
                        <l>For always.</l>

                        <l>If you will take a poor man, but half way</l>
                        <l>To where he hopes to reach. Iâm prospering, love.</l>

                        <l>A cruel tongue against me, cruel smiles</l>
                        <l>And frowns, or cruel hands, I must have been</l>
                        <l>Only more wretched; though Iâd wildly think</l>
                        <l>Often and often I could draw free breath</l>

                        <l>A weary woman plodding on alone,</l>
                        <l>Thinking sometimes âAlas I might have gone</l>

                        <l>Too sadly on the old bright time of love,</l>
                        <l>As in your age you might look back on youth;</l>
                        <l>But you had no fond passion quick in you</l>
                        <l>To make a fever in your heart. That pulsed</l>
                        <l>Too slow and chilly. You were faint because</l>
                        <l>You had foregone the love on which it lived,</l>
                        <l>And you knew that. But, dear, you let the love</l>

                        <l>Not that heâd love me thenâno never thatâ</l>
                        <l>But that thereâd be some bond between us then,</l>

                        <l>This mannerly kind hateful indifference.</l>
                        <l>At least heâd be ashamed for my shame, drop</l>
                        <l>His eyes that look on me so cold and pleased</l>
                        <l>At our next meeting, stammer when he spoke.</l>
                        <l>Perhaps heâd shun me. Aye, and at the least</l>
                        <l>I could shun him. Now I dare never wince,</l>
                        <l>Nor stand a step back from a meeting, lest</l>
                        <l>He should discover.</l>

                        <l>Before he knew it. Now I as well know</l>
                        <l>Heâll never, never, never think again</l>

                        <l>Of wooings and of shrinkings interchanged</l>

                        <l>Not if I worshipped him with the fine fumes</l>
                        <l>Of delicate nice flattery some I know</l>
                        <l>Will offer to their idol, while his brain</l>

                        <l>And provocations of a mimic feud:</l>
                        <l>Not if I pleased him with an equal mind</l>
                        <l>To be convinced by arguments of his:</l>
                        <l>Not if I sang to tears for him, made mirth,</l>

                        <l>Not if I lived my whole poor life for him:</l>

                        <l>To serve him something: heâd not love me yet,</l>
                        <l>He could not. When youâre in a pleasant dream</l>

                        <l>Youâll dream again, perhaps, as he, they say,</l>

                        <l>Dear, tell me all.</l>
                        <l>It comforts you to tell me. Do not fear</l>
                        <l>I cannot share it with you. I have now</l>
                        <l>So large a happiness that it is wide</l>
                        <l>To hold most sorrowsâmore than sorrow can.</l>
                        <l>I know that, I, who once had sorrow too,</l>

                        <l>So shallowârighteous that. I can scorn grief</l>
                        <l>Because perhaps there went one drop of wrong</l>
                        <l>To tip its sting? Scorn you too for your love?</l>
                        <l>I know you have all pride a woman should</l>

                        <l>Youâd not woo, you, if you could win him so.</l>

                        <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                        <l>Yet let me tell you. While my husband lived</l>
                        <l>In seeming strength I had a creeping fear</l>
                        <l>Would haunt my conscience like bad memories there,</l>
                        <l>As if, if he should die, I should perceive</l>
                        <l>A sense of freedom, and go lighter stepped,</l>
                        <l>And not be sad at all as I must seem.</l>
                        <l>But while I nursed him dying that was changed.</l>
                        <l>I did not feign the tenderness I shewed,</l>
                        <l>Nor wear my care for ornament. I seemed</l>
                        <l>To love him since he suffered. And I felt</l>
                        <l>That to <emph>his</emph> best he loved me. So I wept</l>
                        <pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7196-032"/>
                        <l>Because we were to part with such an awe,</l>
                        <l>And he was scared at dying, <emph>not</emph> because</l>
                        <l>It seemed the wifeâs right way. And then, he dead,</l>
                        <l>The irretrievable strange going hence,</l>
                        <l>And something too the still dread show of death,</l>
                        <l>Struck me with such a sadness as made tears</l>
                        <l>A natural comfort to me, made the calm</l>
                        <l>Of one who has been grieving hush my life.</l>
                        <l>And while I still was sad a good kind soulâ</l>
                        <l>If she had but grown dumb as well as deaf!</l>
                        <l>Came with her cordial chatter. âSo, my dear,</l>
                        <l>The widowâs weeds put by. Well, quite time too:</l>
                        <l>Youâve worn them past the fashion for wives now.</l>
                        <l>Iâm glad too; for my nephewâs coming soon.</l>
                        <l>Donât think I did not know that naughty workâ</l>
                        <l>You were too bad. But he could never bear</l>
                        <l>A word against you. Ah! heâs true to you,</l>
                        <l>Like lovers in old times. You never heard</l>
                        <l>I think of that bad fever that he had</l>
                        <l>And raved of you long after you were wed.</l>
                        <l>Ah he raves now of you another way,</l>
                        <l>Poor boy. Youâll not desert him now again.â</l>
                        <l>I thought she knew. I had not seen him then</l>
                        <l>Since he had made me promise, but some months</l>
                        <l>Before my marriage, to be true to him,</l>
                        <l>And strong.âStrong! I who was too weak to stand</l>
                        <l>Against some breaths of anger and the stress</l>
                        <l>Of long persuasions and the paltry lure</l>

                        <l>Of being the great lady all ablow</l>
                        <l>With insolent wealth and fashion. Strong! and Iâ</l>
                        <l>Why did he trust me? He should have staid near,</l>
                        <l>If but to look at me the silent look</l>
                        <l>That made me feel my purpose confident</l>
                        <l>Because he trusted.</l>
                        <l>Well, to tell my tale:</l>
                        <l>I played the cheat to him and to Sir Joyce:</l>
                        <l>Loved one and left him, did not love the other</l>
                        <l>And married him. But, foolishly enough,</l>
                        <l>It was the one I left who made complaint</l>
                        <l>As if I had been worth it. Laugh with me;</l>
                        <l>How foolish men will be! Aye you hold up</l>
                        <l>A warning finger. Well, Iâll be sedate,</l>
                        <l>And pity my own sorrows decorously.</l>
                        <l>He was angry, had some bickering with Sir Joyce,</l>
                        <l>(They never told me what nor why), and so</l>
                        <l>They broke acquaintance and we never met.</l>
                        <l>How could I tell that the good cacklerâs talk</l>
                        <l>Was ... what it was?</l>
                        <l>Alas! for many weeks</l>
                        <l>It chimed in like rich music when I thought,</l>
                        <l>Growing sweeter, sweeter, sweeter, day by day,</l>
                        <l>As never surely the good womanâs words</l>
                        <l>Were heard in any ears before. I framed</l>
                        <l>My hopes, my fancies, purposes, to them,</l>
                        <l>And, since the time seemed long till he should come,</l>
                        <l>Spent my full heart in dayâdreams.</l>
                        <pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7196-034"/>
                        <l>Did I say,</l>
                        <l>A while ago, Iâd dream here now with you</l>
                        <l>As we were wont? Ah! Mary, weariness</l>
                        <l>Can never dream. It sleeps, or is afire</l>
                        <l>With fever of a visionary toil</l>
                        <l>Over the trodden way that was so long.</l>
                        <l>I know no dreamings now.</l>
                        <l>Oh, foolish me!</l>
                        <l>I saw one bar, and only one. I thought.</l>
                        <l>âHeâd never take me with my clog of lands,</l>
                        <l>Houses, and shares, and so forth, which are mine</l>
                        <l>Because I was another manâs. Heâs proud,</l>
                        <l>He will not be beholden to Sir Joyce.â</l>
                        <l>And so among my dreams I saw the joy</l>
                        <l>Of sacrificing what I once prized far</l>
                        <l>Beyond its worth, and still prized something well,</l>
                        <l>To him, to our newâblossomed love. And then</l>
                        <l>I fancied how heâd thank me, and forgive,</l>
                        <l>And praise me as in old days.</l>
                        <l>Well, we met.</l>
                        <l>I woke, at the first moment woke. He smiled,</l>
                        <l>And I could have shrieked, weeping out aloud,</l>
                        <l>But I smiled too. And bye and bye I tried</l>
                        <l>To fool myself a little: but âtwas vain.</l>
                        <l>We have talked oftenâalways pleasantly,</l>
                        <l>Appropriately to the occasion tooâ</l>
                        <l>And I could hate myself who looked to him</l>
                        <l>For more than that. I heard a while ago</l>
                        <pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7196-035"/>
                        <l>That he was new betrothed. I never asked</l>
                        <l>Was the news true or false. To me âtis one.</l>
                        <l>Nothing could make me less to him than now,</l>
                        <l>Or more. To him IâmâTalk of something else,</l>
                        <l>Of any thing but me. âTis your turn now.</l>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
                        <l>Well then of me. Iâll preach a little hope</l>
                        <l>Out of my simple life. Once, some years past,</l>
                        <l>I was betrothedânot yet so long ago</l>
                        <l>I could have told my tale more passionately,</l>
                        <l>With intricate vexed memories, have marked</l>
                        <l>The turns and changes and the subtle breaks,</l>
                        <l>Showing âI hoped thusâ and âI sorrowed thus:â</l>
                        <l>But now I find so little to be told.</l>
                        <l>Whilst I was loving happily I learned</l>
                        <l>That I must love no more. I bade him wed</l>
                        <l>The mother of his child; and that he did,</l>
                        <l>And has been worthier since. But, Eleanor,</l>
                        <l>I suffered. Nay I think it must be worse</l>
                        <l>Than oneâs own due remorse for wrong to find</l>
                        <l>Shame in you for the man you love. And I</l>
                        <l>Was heavy for the loss of love and hopes</l>
                        <l>That had beenâah we know what such hopes are.</l>
                        <l>I was so desolate for long. I would</l>
                        <l>That I could make you feel it; but myself</l>
                        <l>I cannot feel it now. The sun aglow,</l>
                        <l>Warm on my eyes, has dazzled them from sight</l>
                        <l>Of the clouds far floating backwards from the rent</l>
                        <l>It burst between them. Oh, dear Eleanor,</l>

                        <l>Never believe there is not happiness</l>
                        <l>Waiting you somewhere. I was helpless once,</l>
                        <l>And thought my life would limp on darkling, lost</l>
                        <l>In the clinging mist.</l>

                        <l>Without a woman loving him and loved?</l>
                        <l>And, dear, we seem well paired. We think alike</l>

                        <l>By nodding constant Yesâes. We blend well</l>
                        <l>In tastes too. And, since we both have known a love</l>
                        <l>Which darkened into storm and wearied us</l>
                        <l>With tossing long unrestâfor once he wooed</l>
                        <l>Some fickle beauty and believed heâd won,</l>
                        <l>And then she left himâsince we have both known</l>

                        <l>You scorn such bright monotony, youâd have</l>

                        <l>I had a little foolish lingering hope.</l>
                        <l>âTis strange I could! I knew so well the truth</l>
                        <l>That I was nothing to him.</l>

                        <l>Iâm coming to you; I, not Eleanor:</l>
                        <l>Sheâs gone, sheâs dead. But, as for Lady Boycott,</l>
                        <l>Perhaps youâll like her ...... she is Maryâs friend.</l>

                    <l>And shivered sickly lest it should arise</l>
                    <l>And shrivel him with dreadful ghostly looks,</l>
                    <l>Alive with awful life. Yes, let him breathe</l>
                    <l>With the sharp gasps of some mad hunted thing</l>
                    <l>When none pursue. Let him cry out aloud</l>
                    <l>With anguish, and not know how to repent.</l>
                    <l>Let him go agonized with doubt, and know</l>
                    <l>Doubt and belief make no more now for him</l>
                    <l>Than for dumb dogs. Only let him not die</l>
                    <l>And fall asleep.â Yes none will say âHis pain</l>
                    <l>Is more than he can bear.â</l>
                    <l>Where Jesus was</l>
                    <l>None could be friendless, none despair: and nowâ</l>
                    <l>My name is blotted from among the names</l>
                    <l>Of the living, there is no man says to me</l>
                    <l>âAlas my brother!â There is no God for me</l>
                    <l>Who heareth prayer. I only in the world</l>
                    <l>Have not a God to cry to. Who is God</l>
                    <l>But He who sent us Christ? And who is Christ</l>
                    <l>But Jesus the Nazarene, Jesus who had</l>
                    <l>The Godhead in him? Die, thou lost one, die!</l>
                    <l>I know him now and tremble, know Him now</l>
                    <l>Whom I believed in vaguely, whom I sold!</l>
                    <l>How should I pray? âJehovah whose own Son,</l>
                    <l>A very part of thee, I did to death,</l>
                    <l>Be very gracious to me for His sake?â</l>
                    <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7196-051"/>
                    <l>Aye so, He said prayer should be in his name,</l>
                    <l>And taught us how to use it. Properly</l>
                    <l>âTwould fit my lipsâHis name a plea for me!</l>
                    <l>Would God that Baal had a life in him</l>
                    <l>And could at least do harm. Iâd pray to him</l>
                    <l>âBaal, for love of my great sin, do thou</l>
                    <l>Give me kind nothingness, make me a thing</l>
                    <l>Like thy block image, soulless, ignorant</l>
                    <l>Of light and darkness and of any thought.â</l>
                    <l>âBaal,â Iâd say, âfall on me, batter me</l>
                    <l>To piecemeal rubbish, and drag down my soul</l>
                    <l>To thy void chaos where âtwill rot with thee,</l>
                    <l>To thy void chaos where God will not come,</l>
                    <l>Nor Jesus.â</l>
                    <l>Did my heart leap to him once,</l>
                    <l>Our holy Master? Surely it did once.</l>
                    <l>I left my home, even as the others left,</l>
                    <l>Left all my worldly goods to follow him,</l>
                    <l>Even as the others, bore with scoffs and taunts,</l>
                    <l>And tender sad reproach more hard to bear.</l>
                    <l>I loved the holiness he taught, I loved</l>
                    <l>The love, I loved the glorious saintly scorn</l>
                    <l>Of all things tyrannous and cunning, loved</l>
                    <l>The pitying tenderness for all things weak.</l>
                    <l>And then his talk stirred longings in my heart</l>
                    <l>For freer breath than we draw now, strong days</l>
                    <l>Rid of the hindering trammels we have now,</l>
                    <l>Justice and mercy in our streets, rich peace,</l>
                    <pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7196-052"/>
                    <l>And God to rule and judge us as of old.</l>
                    <l>I thought the lookedâfor King was come in Him,</l>
                    <l>And he would so deliver us. I looked</l>
                    <l>To see the Romans scattered, fleeing hence,</l>
                    <l>Calling in terror on their idle gods,</l>
                    <l>Before avenging Israel. I looked</l>
                    <l>To have our Zion sing the song of praise,</l>
                    <l>And the hills laugh with golden harvests thick</l>
                    <l>Up to their brows, and the green valleys ring</l>
                    <l>With singing of full rivers through the fields,</l>
                    <l>Because the great Messiah King was come</l>
                    <l>With spoils in His rightâhand of all our foes</l>
                    <l>And blessings for the people. But he seemed</l>
                    <l>To bow the neck to CÃ¦sar patiently</l>
                    <l>And care for no deliverance. Poverty</l>
                    <l>Was the first blessing that he offered us</l>
                    <l>To make the world a kind one. And we saw,</l>
                    <l>We who were watching, for his cry to sound</l>
                    <l>âNow Israel to your tents,â we who believed</l>
                    <l>We should be leaders under him and lords,</l>
                    <l>To have the people honour us, and live</l>
                    <l>In our ceiled palaces among the tribes</l>
                    <l>Content and prospering around us, saw</l>
                    <l>He would but teach submission to the yoke,</l>
                    <l>Saw we were only chosen to be poor</l>
                    <l>More than all others, meaner, more despised,</l>
                    <l>Servants of servants, we. And many turned,</l>
                    <l>And saw his face no more. But I remained,</l>
                    <pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7196-053"/>
                    <l>I loved his teaching though it angered me,</l>
                    <l>I saw the greatness of it.</l>
                    <l>Would to God</l>
                    <l>I too had left him!</l>
                    <l>Why did they all smile</l>
                    <l>With mocking eyes, that day when I was vexed</l>
                    <l>To see the spikenard wasted? If they had had</l>
                    <l>The wisdom to be secret of their thoughts</l>
                    <l>And somewhat less discerning, those prompt priests</l>
                    <l>With their shrewd chaffering might perhaps have had</l>
                    <l>No bargain out of meâIâd said them nay</l>
                    <l>To more before that time, and to my thought</l>
                    <l>Theyâd ceased to look to me for any help.</l>
                    <l>Why did the others chafe me? If the purse</l>
                    <l>Had now and then, âtwas rarely, furnished me</l>
                    <l>A secret pittance to supply the needs</l>
                    <l>And hide the shame of the poor squalid life</l>
                    <l>I led with sick dislike, had I not lost</l>
                    <l>The promise of good days? Had I not lost</l>
                    <l>My chance of growing gains, my handicraft</l>
                    <l>To earn me something more than beggarâs fare?</l>
                    <l>Did I not always with my nicest skill,</l>
                    <l>Such as not one of them could reach, swell out</l>
                    <l>Our wretched means and make two pence like three?</l>
                    <l>Why, but by that, I gave more than I took,</l>
                    <l>Threefold and fourfold. Yes the brethren might</l>
                    <l>Have spared their smiles. How hot they made my heart!</l>
                    <pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7196-054"/>
                    <l>I hated them.</l>
                    <l>And then His grave sad look!</l>
                    <l>He saw too far into menâs hearts. What man</l>
                    <l>Can live with one who knows him at his worst?</l>
                    <l>It makes him have no best. I could not bear</l>
                    <l>Their scorn, His knowing. I would show them all</l>
                    <l>I had some powerâaye and I had a purse</l>
                    <l>Besides their bag to draw from. In my haste</l>
                    <l>I wentâand afterwards it seemed too late.</l>
                    <l>I know not how, the priests can argue well,</l>
                    <l>If they pay smally. And the time was short;</l>
                    <l>I never seemed to have the space to think,</l>
                    <l>Till I awoke, and <emph>knew</emph>.</l>
                    <l>The time was short.</l>
                    <l>He saw too far into menâs hearts: he knew</l>
                    <l>The purpose dizzying mine. Aye, there was need</l>
                    <l>To hasten its fulfillment. Could I wait</l>
                    <l>And nurse it while he watched me? âWhat thou doest</l>
                    <l>Do quickly.â And I did not dare to ask</l>
                    <l>A meaning for it. He knew me. And I fled</l>
                    <l>Out from his presence. What had it served then</l>
                    <l>To lag and waver, and perchance repent?</l>
                    <l>He knew me.</l>
                    <l>Jesus is dead, is dead. Go to,</l>
                    <l>The very devils, sure, must mourn for that;</l>
                    <l>For I mourn. Jesus is dead, who looked on me</l>
                    <l>As if he loved me though he knew me. Dead!</l>
                    <l>I never thought theyâd kill him. Dead, I say.</l>

                    <l>Whatâs that to you? Thereâs one, your purchased wretch,</l>
                    <l>Mad with the worst guilt the foul world has known,</l>
                    <l>His very prayer made sin. Whatâs that to you?</l>

                    <l>You only planned and plotted, you are pure.</l>
                    <l>You kept the highâday too, the cross was bare</l>

                        <l>Since thereâs a body and the body moves</l>

                        <l>I saw the God in him. It is past thought</l>

                        <l>To check the infuriate mob. Yes, by the gods,</l>

                        <l>Had made a rare case of it: for the man,</l>

                        <l>Of all save too much wisdom for their wits,</l>
                        <l>Was doubtless somewhere tangled in the toils</l>
                        <l>Of their fastidious laws. Why, he had washed</l>
                        <l>At the wrong timeâor had not washed, which was it?</l>
                        <l>He said the Scribes were pedants and the priests</l>
                        <l>Rank hypocrites ... which only we may say,</l>
                        <l>And which weâre bidden not say to the Jews;</l>
                        <l>He told the mob their God was, after all,</l>
                        <l>More than their Moses; and, most heinous sin,</l>
                        <l>He healed their sick on sabbaths. By their law</l>
                        <l>He ought to die; their rulers urged that loud.</l>
                        <l>Never let any say I was unjust.</l>
                        <l>âThe Son of Godâ he took for name, they said.</l>
                        <l>Belike one of their Syriac metaphors</l>
                        <l>Which, like hotâtempered kestrels, overfly</l>
                        <l>The quarry aimed at. But, if he did mean</l>

                        <l>Of life and thought divinely different</l>

                        <l>To stare and wonder what he means and cry</l>
                        <l>âOh the rare teacher!â till the next one comes,</l>
                        <l>So dubbed him, why, âtis but the ancient tale:</l>
                        <l>The multitude, selfâconscious, thinks a man</l>
                        <l><emph>Must</emph> be a fool and base, and when it finds</l>

                        <l>Is sure by that his father is a god,</l>
                        <l>Or heâs a god himself, or going to be.</l>
                        <l>But Jesus if he said I am the Son</l>
                        <l>Of a divine one, or of the One God,</l>
                        <l>Implied some esoteric subtlety</l>
                        <l>With a great importâfor I looked on him</l>
                        <l>And heard him speak, and his was no crazed soul,</l>
                        <l>Fired from its own dank heat like illâhoused ricks;</l>
                        <l>And no impostor, sane, would in such stead</l>
                        <l>Have kept so obstinate a courage.</l>
                        <l>Truth!</l>
                        <l>He claimed to know truth, which no man yet knew.</l>
                        <l>Was that his meaning? Truth is real life,</l>
                        <l>Such as the gods might have, and he had reached</l>
                        <l>To truth and so was as One near the gods,</l>
                        <l>Or near the great One Godâwhich possibly</l>
                        <l>Is but a name of life.</l>
                        <l>But why waste thought</l>
                        <l>To beat out the philosophy or creed</l>
                        <l>He would have taught, from the disfiguring husks</l>
                        <l>Rough rumour gives as grain? The man is dead;</l>

                        <l>He sleeps the silent sleep which ends all hope,</l>
                        <l>And we may bawl our questions at his door,</l>
                        <l>Heâll make no answer. Dead philosophers</l>

                        <l>The while, about their values. If by chance</l>
                        <l>We take the mint of one man for some worth,</l>
                        <l>Then in a trice weâre rich with counterfeits</l>

                        <l>The sounds he makes have such results on ears</l>
                        <l>Which are our own, and so we say weâre sure,</l>
                        <l>Though in true sense weâre sure of nothing.</l>
                        <l>Aye,</l>

                        <l>Because I tremble. Somewhere there must be</l>
                        <l>A terror near, or why should I be scared?</l>
                        <l>Thereâs all my reasoning. The baby cries,</l>
                        <l>And some one helps it, lights it safe to bed.</l>
                        <l>The man must hold his peace, or theyâll say âmadâ</l>
                        <l>And chain and lash him long before heâs mad</l>
                        <l>With trying to make out his bugbearâs shape.</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Nay Iâll not peer for mine. I could not bear</l>
                        <l>Poor Proclaâs fancies and I sent her hence,</l>
                        <l>To be in peace, but my own fancies are</l>
                        <l>Like monster shadows, hers thrown hideously</l>
                        <l>On lurid mists. What! can I never now</l>
                        <l>Trust myself with myself? Must there still come</l>
                        <l>This madmanâs mood upon me, as if guilt</l>
                        <l>Were more than man can bear who yet bears death</l>
                        <pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7196-071"/>
                        <l>With pleasantness if any one be near</l>
                        <l>To give him honour for it?</l>
                        <l>Ah! they say</l>
                        <l>Through all his anguish he would still look down</l>
                        <l>With an ineffable strange pitying,</l>
                        <l>As if âtwas those below who died, not he;</l>
                        <l>They say through all heânay, no more of this.</l>
                        <l>The crime sits hard enough on my wrung mind</l>
                        <l>Without these useless broodings to swell out</l>
                        <l>Its vampire bulk. I know too certainly</l>
                        <l>I shall be haunted with it all my days,</l>
                        <l>As if the Furies clung to me. But I</l>
                        <l>Refuse the guilt, I did not will the doom;</l>
                        <l>Let the Jews look to it, they took his death</l>
                        <l>On them and on their children.</l>
                        <l>But if aught</l>
                        <l>Could purify me Iâd give this right hand</l>
                        <l>The water should have cleansed from that just blood,</l>
                        <l>To purchase that redemption.</l>
                        <l>Well, âtis naught.</l>
                        <l>To weep past evil is a vainer thing</l>
                        <l>Than to shake drops of dew upon the fire.</l>
                        <l>Iâll think noâ more of itâwereât possible</l>
                        <l>Iâd never think again. Thereâs much to do,</l>
                        <l>These letters should be sent to Rome at once.</l>

                        <l>We cannot tell. He said he was the life,</l>

                        <l>Aye, we may weep. We seemed to have a hope</l>
                        <l>For Israel and for us. And lo! the strength</l>
                        <l>Of Satan has been stronger than Christâs strength.</l>
                        <l>We are given over to our sins and death,</l>
                        <l>God will not pity us. He has looked down</l>
                        <l>On Israelâs stubbornness, and turns aside</l>
                        <l>His purposed blessing from us. Jesus came</l>
                        <l>And said, âBe happy, be the sons of God.â</l>
                        <l>And Israel answered âNay, but we will have</l>
                        <l>The yoke that is too heavy and the pain</l>
                        <l>That is too sharp. We will not come to thee</l>
                        <l>For life, but we will live <emph>our</emph> life and die.â</l>
                        <l>And Israel answered âNay but thy sweet words</l>
                        <l>Are bitter in our ears because of sin.</l>
                        <l>Depart from us, be dumb among the dead.â</l>
                        <l>And so they slew him. Oh! our Master slain</l>
                        <l>With the transgressors! And the promise given</l>
                        <l>For ages and for ages, Israelâs hope</l>
                        <l>And consolation, marred in the very hour</l>
                        <l>Of its fulfillment! Now shall men drudge on</l>

                        <l>We who have known him, know he was the Christ</l>

                        <l>We will not doubt of that. But, woe is me</l>
                        <l>For our lost hope! Christ should have ruled the world.</l>

                    <l rend="ti-2">Riding out a hawking through the vale,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Paused to hear the singing</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Of a sweet voice silver ringing,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">As it were</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">From the greenness of a thorn,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Making music of the air,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Making music of his heart?</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">And he said âSince I was born</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Never heard I song like this,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Making me of it a part,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Making me as one with bliss.â</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Then he sprang from off his steed,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">And he hunted, hunted vainly,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Though he heard the voice still plainly</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Trilling out the wondrous song.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">âHereâ he cried âis none indeed!</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Yet I hear the wondrous song</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">Still more plainly.</l>
                    <l>I might hear it so for ever, never thinking time grew long.â</l>
                    <l>So he came there day by day, living almost in the singing</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Of the sweet voice silver ringing</l>

                    <l>âOh! might I see thee!â he would say, âthee wonderful who singest so.â</l>
                    <l>Then the voice would seem to mock him, trilling out a laughing scorn,</l>
                    <l>Else would pass away in sweetness, dying in a cadence slow,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Dying, dying, sweet and slow.</l>
                    <l>Never might he see the singer, though he hunted far and near</l>
                    <l>While the summerâweeks passed onwards setting all the flowers aglow,</l>
                    <l>Till when Augustâs scorching breath was hot upon the yellowed corn,</l>
                    <l>He, leaning âgainst the sloping thornâtree, listening, thrilled throughout to

                    <l rend="ti-2">Trembled in a tear.</l>
                    <l>âAh!â he sighed âand this that singeth doubtless hath but its brief part</l>
                    <l>In the lifetime of this earth, hath no share in Heavenâs weal.</l>
                    <l>Ah the pity! Ah the pity!â Then from his mistâclouded eye</l>

                    <l rend="ti-2">I of a coward fleeing?</l>
                    <l>To leave thee, owning my loving a sin,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Calling thy loving a momentâs and vain,</l>
                    <l>Now when thou hast grown to my being akin,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Only through love.â</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">But softly from above</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Rang that strange voice, slow and plain,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">âNot through love only;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Was there not sorrow?â</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">But we cried ever</l>
                    <l>âNay why should ye part for one to live lonely</l>
                    <pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7196-190"/>
                    <l rend="ti-3">And one to die?</l>
                    <l>Take heed to thee Amys; the day ye shall sever</l>
                    <l>One of the two may lie dead on the morrow.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Take heed to thyself; if her love goes by</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3"><emph>She</emph> cannot die.â</l>
                    <l>But the voice rose clear above our song</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">âYet be strong,</l>
                    <l>Choosing any anguish more than wrong.â</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Then he rose up, very white, and said</l>
                    <l>âDearest never think of me again;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Let it be as if I were dead,</l>
                    <l>And do not try to learn our human pain,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Who canst not our human comfort know.</l>
                    <l>Laugh, love, like thyself, and say good bye.</l>
                    <l>Love, I must no more look on thy dear face;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Give me one little kiss and let me go.â</l>
                    <l>But she made a little startled cry,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Like a baby child amazed</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">At a sudden chiding blow,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">And into his eyes she gazed</l>
                    <l>With a fond beseeching grace,</l>
                    <l>Saying âLove it is not true?</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Thou art mocking me.</l>
                    <l>Let be, let be, with the idle jest,</l>
                    <l>Take back my hands, lay my head on thy breast.â</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Saying âIs it because it seems to thee</l>
                    <l>That I cannot love as a woman might do?</l>
                    <l>But teach me then, I shall learn the way</l>
                    <pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7196-191"/>
                    <l>Easily, easily, after toâday:</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">For have I not wept thy tears?â</l>
                    <l>Saying âIs it because I cannot share</l>
                    <l>Thy grave long thoughts as a woman might share?</l>
                    <l>But, love, I can charm from thee all lifeâs care,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">And make thee one gladness of all lifeâs years.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Oh! love me a little while longer yet,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Oh! a little little while longer yet.â</l>
                    <l>Then his frame with a great trembling shook,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">And his teeth were set,</l>
                    <l>And the words he gasped died away,</l>
                    <l>Like the cries of a dreamer in the night,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">In a stifled moan.</l>
                    <l>Then he looked in her eyes with a weary look,</l>
                    <l>And at last we could hear him sayâ</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Oh his lips were white,</l>
                    <l>And his eyes were strange with a cold hard light,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">And his voice was dull and slowâ</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">âNow it may not be.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">But kiss me again ere I go,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">That I may think of thee</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">As even in farewell my own,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Even in this farewell.â</l>
                    <l>And she clung to him and kissed him, brow, and lip, and cheek,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">And she did not speak,</l>
                    <l>But piteously and pleading looked up into his face:</l>

                    <l>But he put her slowly from him, and hurried with an angry pace</l>
                    <l>Homeward through the dreary valley, in the ever darkening rain:</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">And a shadow fell</l>
                    <l>Over the thorn, and the loud long winds hissed through the shivering

                    <l rend="ti-2">Faint grew his heart, faint with a long distress,</l>

                    <l rend="ti-3">We watched him daily, how he spent</l>

                    <l rend="ti-3">His gaze upon those pure eyes bent</l>

                    <l rend="ti-2">Right at his knees, a fireâeyed elf</l>
                    <l>Shrilling âBrave heart! she must linger alone,</l>

                    <l>Look upâDo I keep the word I have spoken?â</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Then Amys wakened by the spell,</l>

                    <l>And, one by one, the slow tears crept</l>

                    <l rend="ti-2">Dreaming bitter memories.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">And she sighed a low weak wail,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Like far waves in the sobbing gale</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Sighing along the shore.</l>

                    <l>Then with sudden bounds he sprang</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">The home in London chosen, himself installed,</l>
                        <l>Gervase half eager, half reluctant, went</l>
                        <l>To greet the Westlands. Scoldingly the aunt,</l>
                        <l>And cordially, gave welcome; as one scolds</l>
                        <l>A truant favourite and praises him</l>
                        <l>For coming back at last. The daughters teased,</l>
                        <l>Evelyn among them, with a playful show</l>
                        <l>Of making him a stranger, and were kind</l>
                        <l>With a benevolent modest courtesy ......</l>
                        <l>Which Gervase quite forgot to think by rule,</l>
                        <l>Although, in sooth, they would have been the same</l>
                        <l>To one less liked. But he discerned in them</l>
                        <l>A frank goodwill, and was at ease, assured</l>
                        <l>Of his familiar place with them again.</l>
                        <l>And if sweet Evelyn flushed a little more</l>
                        <l>Than her sisters when she spoke, it might be chance,</l>
                        <l>Or else her fairer skin which showed the glow</l>
                        <l>Sooner than theirs; for she betrayed no sign</l>
                        <l>Of flutter or of coyness.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l>She had passed</l>
                        <l>From gift to woman, and was lovelier,</l>
                        <l>As the evening star grows lovelier, that glows</l>
                        <l>With its full light, than when it first awoke,</l>
                        <pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7196-212"/>
                        <l>White and uncertain, in its younger gleam.</l>
                        <l>But she was yet a girl in years, and kept</l>
                        <l>A something of the child in her grave eyes,</l>
                        <l>And the childâs questioning look. He could not keep</l>
                        <l>From watching her, she was so rare a thing:</l>
                        <l>And presently it seemed as if his talk</l>
                        <l>Was all for her, whoever questioned him</l>
                        <l>Or answered. And she, by degrees, became</l>
                        <l>More silent than her share, checked by the sense</l>
                        <l>Of a halfâsweet constraint, and blushed confused</l>
                        <l>Because he made her beauty present to her.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l rend="ti-1">So Gervase sat and told his travel tales,</l>
                        <l>Not ill content to be a hero, pleased</l>
                        <l>With the girlsâ eager questions and the praise</l>
                        <l>And halfâapproving blames of his good aunt,</l>
                        <l>And Evelynâs quiet smiles. He took amiss</l>
                        <l>The break, when suddenly a gipsy face,</l>
                        <l>A quaint face, olive, but with hair all glow,</l>
                        <l>Like sunshine on brown rivers, crowning it,</l>
                        <l>Peeped in behind the door, and Constance called</l>
                        <l>âLota come in,â and, giving sudden chase,</l>
                        <l>Brought her among them, ruffled and halfâcrossâ</l>
                        <l>A lithe slight creature, looking scarcely more</l>
                        <l>Than a girlâgrown child; with a rebellious pout,</l>
                        <l>And a sort of sudden fitful prettiness</l>
                        <l>Which flickered and died out by moments. âThisâ</l>
                        <l>Said Mrs Westland, âis my ward and niece,</l>
                        <pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7196-213"/>
                        <l>Whose name is Lota.â Gervase, having made</l>
                        <l>His reverence and noticed the quick grace</l>
                        <l>Of Lotaâs answering movement, asked âBut I?</l>
                        <l>Am I to call her Lota? for you give</l>
                        <l>No other name.â But Lota, with her cheeks</l>
                        <l>A vivid painful crimson, answered him</l>
                        <l>In lofty fashion, slowly. âI am called</l>
                        <l>Miss Deveril.â He bowed and let her be:</l>
                        <l>She did not please him; though she instantly</l>
                        <l>Spoke with a kindness in her voice and eyes</l>
                        <l>âI would not have attempted that vain flight</l>
                        <l>If I had known âtwas you. My cousins speak</l>
                        <l>As if you were a friend.â And Ethel laughed,</l>
                        <l>And said âMoreover Lota knows, alas!</l>
                        <l>That she cannot, with all her hermit ways,</l>
                        <l>Escape from meeting you at last, and so</l>
                        <l>She plucks her nettle boldly.â Gervase smiled</l>
                        <l>âMiss Deveril is kind then to forgive</l>
                        <l>The nettle for upspringing in her path,â</l>
                        <l>And that was all. At night, when he sat still</l>
                        <l>Beside his dying fire, his dreaming sense</l>
                        <l>Was filled with Evelyn, whose fair sweet face</l>
                        <l>Would come uncalled; and, if he thought at all</l>
                        <l>Of Lota, it was as a crossâgrained sprite</l>
                        <l>Unsociable perversely, but not shy,</l>
                        <l>Who seemed beside calm gracious Evelyn</l>
                        <l>The olive that gives zest to generous wine.</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l rend="ti-1">But he saw Lota moreâa score of timesâ</l>
                        <l>And then she seemed to him the veriest witch</l>
                        <l>That ever glamoured men against their wills.</l>
                        <l>He could not read her. She seemed made to sit</l>
                        <l>Out of the wind and sing, to play with life,</l>
                        <l>And think in treble laughters; yet at times,</l>
                        <l>Rarely indeed, sheâd sit in languid rest,</l>
                        <l>Drooping and limp, and answer with a voice</l>
                        <l>That seemed asleep and sad; and often too</l>
                        <l>Stole through her mirth a tremulous bitterness</l>
                        <l>That jarred unnatural in such an elf</l>
                        <l>Of freak and sportiveness; and most of all</l>
                        <l>When she was bitter she was tender too,</l>
                        <l>Yet hard when she was simply gay. She fled</l>
                        <l>From strangersâ presence, yet, if she was forced</l>
                        <l>To front it, bore herself, first queenly, then</l>
                        <l>With a flash and glitter of quick wit and glow</l>
                        <l>Of almost joy that proved how far she was</l>
                        <l>From the sad love of solitary calm,</l>
                        <l>And how far from uncouth sly bashfulness</l>
                        <l>Of conscious silly schoolgirls. Then her face,</l>
                        <l>Which changed its meaning at a word, would change</l>
                        <l>Sometimes another way, and sudden show</l>
                        <l>On its round girlishness a worn waned look,</l>
                        <l>As of a woman growing older. So</l>
                        <l>She angered him with changes, as youâre vexed</l>
                        <l>With the symphony that hurries you away</l>
                        <l>From the sweet strain you liked to one more wild</l>
                        <pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7196-215"/>
                        <l>And then, ere you are sated with the new,</l>
                        <l>Takes you at unawares back to the first.</l>
                        <l>Changed music does not tire though it may chafe,</l>
                        <l>And Lotaâs fitfulness was never dull.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l rend="ti-1">And Gervase quarreled with her day by day,</l>
                        <l>Till Evelyn knew he loved her; though at first</l>
                        <l>Himself he hardly knew it. Evelyn watched</l>
                        <l>With a sick heart, and trembled: once she said</l>
                        <l>âNay, Lota, tell him.â Lots but said âWhy?â</l>
                        <l>And then, when Evelyn spoke, âIt seems to me</l>
                        <l>He loves you,â kissed her fondlingly and laughed</l>
                        <l>âDear love, if he loves either it is you.â</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l rend="ti-1">But she was sadder after that, at times</l>
                        <l>Half querulous, and bitterer when she laughed;</l>
                        <l>And Gervase never said nor did the thing</l>
                        <l>That pleased her. And yet once, and twice, he saw,</l>
                        <l>When she had pained him sharpest, that her eyes</l>
                        <l>Were heavy with big tears and her paled lips</l>
                        <l>Were quivering piteous. And the passion rose</l>
                        <l>Into his heart âShe loves me, and <emph>shall</emph> love.â</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l rend="ti-1">He waited. Lota was so strange; a word</l>
                        <l>At the wrong moment, a too happy look,</l>
                        <l>Too loving, a too confident clasp of hands,</l>
                        <l>Might startle her away from him. She seemed</l>
                        <l>A timorous wild thing, liking to be stroked,</l>

                        <l>Yet shrinking from his hand lest it should hold</l>
                        <l>Too firm for flight, and, suddenly alarmed,</l>
                        <l>Butting for very fear. âI dare not stir,â</l>
                        <l>He said, âlest I should lose her.â And it was</l>
                        <l>As if, in losing Lota, he should lose</l>
                        <l>All fire of loving in him, all delight</l>
                        <l>In womanly sweet charms, in ruddy lips</l>
                        <l>That seem grown ripe for kisses, white warm arms</l>
                        <l>Waiting to cling about a husbandâs neck,</l>
                        <l>Clear eyes meant to look large with love, the play</l>
                        <l>Of glorious blushes flashing at a look,</l>
                        <l>The subtle stir of life in every limb</l>
                        <l>And the round grace of formâall Lota had</l>
                        <l>Less than a many women Gervase knew,</l>
                        <l>Than any of her cousins, but of which</l>
                        <l>She was to him the bodied perfect all.</l>

                        <l>To Evelyn or Constance, a choice spray</l>
                        <l>Of pearly hotâhouse roses amberâtouched</l>
                        <l>Towards the core, because he heard her wish</l>
                        <l>For such a rose to draw into her group:</l>
                        <l>And Lota mocked him for the pains he took</l>
                        <l>To be a squire of dames; and first the flowers</l>
                        <l>Were over yellow for her, then too pale,</l>
                        <l>And then she tossed them into Ethelâs lap,</l>
                        <l>As just the tint to suit her that nightâs dress.</l>

                        <l>Till Mrs Westland, vexed, cried out at her</l>
                        <l>For such a wayward thanklessness âIndeed</l>
                        <l>Gervase is far too good to have so long</l>
                        <l>Taken your snappish ways indifferently,</l>
                        <l>And still have wished to pleasure you toâday.â</l>
                        <l>Then Lota tried to laugh, but suddenly</l>
                        <l>Broke into tears and hurried from the room;</l>
                        <l>And Gervase on the moment followed, snatched</l>
                        <l>Her trembling hand, and drew her suddenly</l>
                        <l>Into the balmy quiet, where sweet flowers</l>
                        <l>And greenness and white placid statues were,</l>
                        <l>Into the balmy quiet, they alone.</l>

                        <l>Her close to him, and close, and filled her face</l>
                        <l>With hot long kisses; while she bent and shook</l>
                        <l>Between his arms like a frail harebell tossed</l>
                        <l>By summer tempests. But a moment more</l>
                        <l>And she broke from him. âNo, Gervase; go from meâ</l>
                        <l>No, not your darling. Nothing, nothing to you.â</l>
                        <l>âMy wife,â he answered, but she would not speak:</l>
                        <l>âMy wife,â he said again, âSpeak. Not my wife?â</l>
                        <l>But she gasped âGo. Oh out of pity go.</l>
                        <l>Toâmorrow I will tell you.â</l>

                        <l>As she spoke</l>
                        <l>The aunt flapped in, rustling against the plants</l>
                        <l>With stormy silks, and panting in her wrath.</l>

                        <l>But Gervase did not wait to learn her mood,</l>

                        <l>Hating the sound of voices till her voice</l>
                        <l>Should say the sweet shamed Yes of the sweet morrow.</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">And he fled homeward, laden with a hope</l>

                        <l>So that he longed for night and mindless sleep,</l>
                        <l>As if it had been pain, to keep it drowsed.</l>
                        <l>And, for some lullaby and present slack</l>
                        <l>To the strong heartâbeats of expectancy,</l>
                        <l>He wove and watched the dreamerâs cloudy coil</l>
                        <l>Of sweet selfâhistories, part shaped of hopes,</l>
                        <l>And part of things that are, and more than all</l>
                        <l>Of bright impossible grave phantasies.</l>
                        <l>He made the wedding over, and his wife</l>
                        <l>Turning to him, Undineâlike, âNow, love,</l>
                        <l>My true great life begins;â and he replied</l>
                        <l>âAnd mine too Lota,â while he took the hand</l>
                        <l>That wore his ring and kissed it; and she lookedâ</l>
                        <l>But the look was not forthcoming, he had seen</l>
                        <l>No such grave radiant love in Lotaâs eyes</l>
                        <l>As would be then, and could not picture it.</l>
                        <l>He made her cantering on his favourite Ralph,</l>
                        <l>A little awkward gracefully, and pleased</l>
                        <l>To need his teaching, while he scolded her</l>
                        <l>By way of praising, riding close beside.</l>
                        <l>He made her wandering with him in his woods,</l>

                        <l>Bidding him drag down boughs beyond her reach</l>
                        <l>Where she was greedy of the bloom, and break</l>
                        <l>The hawthorn stems that were too strong, or climb</l>
                        <l>To spoil some rugged bank down in the copse</l>
                        <l>Of its sweetest primroses; she laughing proud</l>
                        <l>To be the lady of such pleasant lands;</l>
                        <l>He, acting, âSo! âtis not your only joy</l>
                        <l>To be the lady of <emph>me</emph>; you love me not;â</l>
                        <l>And she with merry onslaught pelting him</l>
                        <l>With flowers that cost him so much pains to get.</l>
                        <l>He made her sitting, busy by his side</l>
                        <l>With some light stitchery or book of rhymes</l>
                        <l>That would not too much keep her thoughts from him,</l>
                        <l>In his favourite cosy study, while he worked</l>
                        <l>With pen and papers, changing time by time</l>
                        <l>A smile or playful word lest she grew tired.</l>
                        <l>He made her mistress of his house, or child</l>
                        <l>To play with and to tease; queen whom he served,</l>
                        <l>Or loveâs sweet handmaid fondly tending him;</l>
                        <l>Sudden as now, or calm for happiness;</l>
                        <l>Eager or gentle; frolicsome or grave;</l>
                        <l>But made her always his, her whole thought his.</l>
                        <l>She had told it him that day, if not in words</l>
                        <l>Nor even looks, if not by meeting hand</l>
                        <l>Nor answering lips to kisses, nor coy turn</l>
                        <l>Of head, nor subtle speaking silence, not</l>

                        <l>Yet she had told him. Lota loved him, loved</l>

                        <l>And why she was afraid scarce troubled himâ</l>
                        <l>He was a Lester, had the Lester lands,</l>
                        <l>And Lota Deveril, whose father died</l>
                        <l>A halfâpay major, was left penniless,</l>
                        <l>And did a little drudgework for her keep,</l>
                        <l>Making the children practise and read French</l>
                        <l>And keeping count of tablecloths and spoons:</l>
                        <l>So Gervase read her that she was so proud</l>
                        <l>Sheâd have no husband seem to stoop to her,</l>
                        <l>And wilfully was trampling down the flower</l>
                        <l>Of love that grew towards him as its sun,</l>
                        <l>Her flower of love that would not so be crushed.</l>
                        <l>What then? Toâmorrow she would talk, but he</l>
                        <l>With just âYou love me, what is all the rest?â</l>
                        <l>Would put it by. Toâmorrow!</l>

                        <l>Obeyed now, for his sake, too faithfully?â</l>
                        <l>And ofttimes he would dream her fervid mind,</l>
                        <l>That kept a subtle breath from foreign lands</l>
                        <l>Of faith unprotestant, as garments keep</l>
                        <l>A clinging sense of the rich incense mist,</l>

                        <l>Upon her life, nor purpose set in view,</l>

                        <l>Which could show baseness in her. She remained</l>

                        <l>And in a moment smiled to think what cheats</l>
                        <l>Fancy can put on over anxious eyes.</l>
                        <l>And yet, that nothing might be left undone,</l>
                        <l>Took hastily a fellow dingy cab,</l>

                        <l>Then, on the left, there showed a spire or two</l>

                        <l>Just not too late, and so the train hissed past,</l>

                        <l>And left him in the quiet.</l>

                        <l>Of killing time and happening on oneâs friends.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l rend="ti-1">Gervase kept well aloof, for he had seen</l>
                        <l>This Lotaâs likeness was not by herself,</l>
                        <l>But with a broad short woman, elderly,</l>
                        <l>With something of the peacock in her gait,</l>
                        <l>A homely matron in a changing silk</l>
                        <l>Bulged out with flounces, and an azure tuft</l>
                        <l>Of roses or of dahlias quivering</l>
                        <l>On the satin thing a Madame milliner</l>
                        <l>Would shriek to hear called bonnet. Gervase said</l>
                        <l>âNot Lota, no. That dame of Valentines</l>
                        <l>Proves the younger one not Lota.â Yet a cry</l>
                        <l>âOh Lota, Lota, turn and speak to meâ</l>
                        <l>Rose in his heart. Then too a subtle grace</l>
                        <l>Of rippling equal movement, a swan curve</l>
                        <l>Of the slight neck, a rapid easy turn,</l>
                        <l>This way or that, to look or speak, seemed strange</l>
                        <l>With the strangeness of a once familiar thing.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l rend="ti-1">Six small squat houses, each with its three feet</l>
                        <l>Of garden walk and cheesecake centre bed</l>

                        <l>Fragrant with stocks and wallflowers and sweet pinks,</l>
                        <l>Each with its bright green palings, bright green door,</l>
                        <l>And bright green trellisâthis was Berkeley Place.</l>
                        <l>And at the last green gate the women stopped,</l>
                        <l>But the dame of Valentines went on again,</l>
                        <l>Rustling all over with her goodbye nods;</l>
                        <l>And the other lightly ran into the house.</l>
                        <l>So Gervase sauntered past. A small brass plate,</l>
                        <l>âMadame Guariniâ on the door, a bill</l>
                        <l>Of lodgings in one parlour windowâso</l>
                        <l>Entrance seemed easy. Could it be illâviewed</l>
                        <l>If he should ask what lodgings there might be?</l>
                        <l>Madame Guarini might perchance reveal,</l>
                        <l>Unconsciously, the answer which he sought</l>
                        <l>To a far other question.</l>

                        <l>At a word</l>
                        <l>The little flurried maid unclosed the door</l>
                        <l>Of a small greyâgreen room. âIn here, sir, please.â</l>
                        <l>No one was there, and no one came. He learned</l>
                        <l>The patterns on the drugget and the walls,</l>
                        <l>The different tints of fading on the chairs,</l>
                        <l>The names of the few books, the oftenest note</l>
                        <l>In the twitter of the two brown brightâeyed birds,</l>
                        <l>The number of the blossoms on the plants</l>
                        <l>In the square narrow window; unawares</l>
                        <l>He learned them, then there was no more to learn,</l>

                        <l>And he perceived he was forgotten there,</l>
                        <l>And tried the broken bell a dozen times,</l>
                        <l>And then for patience sake took up a book,</l>
                        <l>A little foolish novel.</l>

                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l>Thus it chanced</l>
                        <l>That she was in the room before he knew.</l>
                        <l>She, Lota! âGervase! Gervase here!â she gasped</l>
                        <l>And seemed struck helpless. Then, her face aglow</l>
                        <l>With a delirious triumph, her eyes bright</l>
                        <l>With sudden tears, she sprang to give her hand.</l>
                        <l>âTo think I did not <emph>feel</emph> that you were here!â</l>

                        <l>And never find a miss of warmer smiles</l>
                        <l>Upon each otherâs faces. I thought first</l>
                        <l>Your love was for sweet stately Evelyn,</l>
                        <l>And afterwardsâah then I would not think;</l>
                        <l>Till Evelyn said a word which I laughed off</l>
                        <l>And then remembered in a sadder mind:</l>
                        <l>And surely I <emph>did</emph> try to change you thenâ</l>
                        <l>I thought I did. I meant to keep the pain</l>
                        <l>For me alone, and let you turn from me</l>
                        <l>With a free heart, forgetting. Ah! my friend,</l>
                        <l>Forgive me, I would freely bear worse harm</l>
                        <l>Than any yet fallen on me, to know you</l>
                        <l>Scathless from my poor folly. But, alas!</l>
                        <l>It is too late: the adder in the grass</l>
                        <l>Looks not too carefully what hand disturbs</l>
                        <l>Its bed in picking daisyâbuds, but digs</l>
                        <l>Its fangs in the nearest flesh. We both are stung:</l>
                        <l>Only I think that you, who have so much</l>
                        <l>To make life strong in you, will soon throw off</l>
                        <l>The last taint of the venom. Oh, youâll find</l>
                        <l>Balm everywhere; your life is still a hope,</l>
                        <l>As lives no older yet than yours and mine</l>
                        <l>Are in their natural current; you can pass</l>
                        <l>Along a safer way and find new flowers.</l>
                        <l>Oh Gervase you, whom I made sad awhile,</l>

                        <l>Of grey hills through the air, and woods where yet</l>
                        <l>The leaves were lingering thinly, of quick brooks</l>
                        <l>Between the redâleafed brambles, slopeâside waves</l>
                        <l>Of plumy fems with fronds just tipped with brown</l>
                        <pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7196-277"/>
                        <l>By earliest frosts, and flowerâweeds in the lanes.</l>
                        <l>And in the sunniest hours of sunny days</l>
                        <l>The cousins lingered through the nearest walks</l>
                        <l>While Lota breathed in life from sun and air,</l>
                        <l>Like flowers, too long forgotten in the dark,</l>
                        <l>That come back to the daylightâtill she said</l>
                        <l>âWhy I am strong!â Then, on an afternoon</l>
                        <l>Yellow with autumn sunlight striking low,</l>
                        <l>She said âMy churchyard is not now too farâ</l>
                        <l>I long to show it, âtis so beautiful.â</l>
                        <l>And so they rambled for an easy mile</l>
                        <l>Through field ways and along a little grove,</l>
                        <l>And came to a grey church with tower and porch</l>
                        <l>Half lost in glistening ivy, and the shade</l>
                        <l>Of a great cedar on its southern wall.</l>
                        <l>And westward a green slope curved slowly down</l>
                        <l>To a broad riverâs brim, where now and then</l>
                        <l>A barge came drifting by, but oftener</l>
                        <l>The great white swans from Yewter Hall at hand</l>
                        <l>Broke the smooth water slowly. Down the slope,</l>
                        <l>And underneath the cedar, lay the graves</l>
                        <l>Among smooth turf, with here and there a flower</l>
                        <l>Of simple kind, set by some loving hand;</l>
                        <l>And here and there a hedgeârose climbed and drooped,</l>
                        <l>With its wild careless trails, about a stone,</l>
                        <l>Pruned off no more than not to hide the nameâ</l>
                        <l>No gardenerâs playground this, but just so kept</l>
                        <l>As showed it was a cared for, sacred place.</l>

                        <l>And from the riverâs other bank there stretched</l>
                        <l>A green far plain of fields that came at last</l>
                        <l>To woodland rises, and above these peered</l>
                        <l>The grey and shadowy line of five long hills.</l>

                        <l>From the worldâs hurry: and they talked of thoughts</l>

                        <l>âI love him so that it would comfort me</l>

                        <l>But Evelyn spoke resolute, though low,</l>

                        <l>And keep life warm by it than we could think</l>
                        <l>We felt the rays hot from a tinsel sun</l>
                        <l>And sit to bask in it upon the stage.</l>

                        <l>Went back once more to the old Barbara,</l>
                        <l>Emilioâs fosterâmother, who one day</l>
                        <l>Had been too deaf to listen, and the next</l>
                        <l>Forgot if she had seen him, yes or no,</l>
                        <l>After his fleeing, and the next declared</l>
                        <l>That Gervase meant him mischief, and would take</l>
                        <l>No pledge or promise from a heretic.</l>
                        <l>Gervase went back to her, with him her priest,</l>
                        <l>âNow will you take the fatherâs word for me,</l>
                        <l>That I intend your fosterâson no harmâ</l>
                        <l>Good rather?â And the priest, blandly, âDo not fear,</l>
                        <l>I know his reason; tell him what you can.â</l>
                        <l>And what she could was that Emilio,</l>
                        <l>Having a loud sweet voice, had gone to sing</l>
                        <l>To the rich English who, she heard, would pay</l>

                        <l>Then sickness, and the hand of death stretched out</l>
                        <l>To take the useless life and hide it down</l>
                        <l>With those who neither work nor starve, but sleep,</l>

                        <l>Confident at first,</l>

                        <l>Indifferent for very hopelessness,</l>
                        <l>Emilio made the round of London marts</l>
                        <l>For loud sweet voices, finding everywhere</l>
                        <l>The same repulse. I heard once of a youth</l>

                        <l>Into the fond dream he was a great prince</l>

                        <l>He learned, poor lad, how much he was a prince,</l>
                        <l>In a hard fashion: and I who, something touched</l>
                        <l>For the poor zany, yet could not but laugh</l>
                        <l>At the quaint error, thought âAnd yet why laugh?</l>
                        <l>We most of us are princes in such guise;</l>
                        <l>And some of us learn hardly in our school,</l>
                        <l>âIâm not the prince imperial, after all;</l>
                        <l>But nobody;â and some who stay at home</l>
                        <l>May never learn it ... All the happier they.â</l>

                        <l>To starving. Piece by piece the coins clinked out</l>
                        <l>From the thin purse that held his fortune: so</l>
                        <l>He must accept his downfall. No prince he</l>

                        <l>Out of the fairy tale to mint red gold</l>

                        <l>And so much grace he gained. But things went ill:</l>

                        <l>A woman with his name, a woman young</l>
                        <l>And worth the claiming; thus they jested him;</l>

                        <l>He never rallied from it. For some days</l>
                        <l>He tried to work, and, as he sadly tells,</l>
                        <l>Tried the first time in life to really pray;</l>
                        <l>And then he lay down on his bed to die,</l>

                        <l>In the shelter of one grassy slope that mounts</l>
                        <l>In soft long curves and then breaks suddenly</l>
                        <l>In a notched line of rugged tableâflat</l>

                        <l>From the grey evening shadows.</l>

                        <l>Said softly âAnd beyond is Italy.â</l>
                        <l>And Lota answered âItaly, where once</l>
                        <l>We were not happy. We will go one day,</l>

                        <l>Lotaâs young cousinâpupils of old days.</l>
                        <l>But Evelyn did not hear her: Evelyn sat</l>
                        <l>Apart beneath a nutâtree, and by her</l>
                        <l>Was Gervase speaking very earnestly</l>
                        <l>And low; and Evelyn smiled.</l>
