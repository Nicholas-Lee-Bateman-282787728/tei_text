                THE WIFE OF MAROBIUS BY MAX EHRMANN
                The Wife of Marobius is strongly dramatic and beautifully simple.--New York Evening Mail.
                Not often is the secret of a woman's emotional na-ture revealed as
                    clearly as in this drama of love and passion.--Pittsburg
                        Press.
                This story is true to-day and forever.--SeattleTimes.
                Max Ehrmann reveals the rich quality of his genius in The Wife of Marobius.--Milwaukee Wis-consin.
                This is a bold theme. Emotion rises to the in-tensest pitch, but the poet
                    rises with it, and no false note is struck. . . . . Ehrmann has produced
                    anotable piece of literature.--Indianapolis News.
                A moving and poignant tragedy, a play that is atonce poetic and
                        dramatic.--Chicago Evening News.
                
                It is intense and exalted; a play of palpitant power,in which barbaric
                    passion breathes through verseof splendid texture.--Pittsburg
                        Gazette Times.
                It is a study of sensuous beauty, warm with lifeand movement, and with a
                    genuine feeling for thetears of things expressed in music woven out
                    ofshadow and the reverses of the spirit. It has beautyand life--Boston Transcript.
                In The Wife of Marobius this gifted author displayshis genius in a new and
                    brilliant light. There is inthe play a dignity of style, a notable
                    eloquence ofexpression, and a dramatic intensity that are
                    tremen-dously compelling.--Buffalo Courier.
                It is marked with passion and intensity; and ispowerfully dramatic.--San Franciso Bulletin.
                How I should love to play it! Really it is full ofgreat, great chances.--William Faversham.
                Here are a fine and sure sense of technique, asubtle understanding of the
                    feminine mind, and anoble feeling for beauty at once sensuous and
                        moral.--The Drama.

                The Wife of Marobius
                PLACE: An antechamber to CLODIA'S
                    bed- room in the house of MAROBIUS
                    at Rome. Around the walls hang seven lamps of gold. The ceiling is
                        traversed by beams bound with bands of silver and gold. On each side of the
                        room stands a marble pillar from which project two candlesticks of seven
                        arches. At back there is a window screened by bronze shutters, be- neath and
                        at the sides of which the wall is embedded with precious stones, pearl, jade
                        and onyx. Against part of the back wall hangs gold woven tapestry. A citrus
                        table stands in the centre of the room; and a couch at right. There is a
                        door at left and a door at right. On the wall near the door at left is
                        attached a cluster of Greek and Barbarian weapons, daggers, spears, and
                        swords. From the ceiling hangs a small bell of hammered gold. The
                        furnishings glitter in the light of the two burning lamps. CLODIA
                    is walking across the room. It is past midnight.
                
                [Enter LYDIA]
                
                    LYDIA
                    I thought that you would be asleep ere now.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    I tried to sleep, but tossed and tossed again.
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    
                        You should lie still and sleep will come. The
                        night
                        Is still, the house is still, but we yet stir.
                    
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    
                        To me the night is full of ugly noise;
                        You say the night is still?
                    
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    
                        No sound at all,
                        Save now and then a wind that moves the leaves.
                    
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Then must the noise be in myself.
                
                
                
                    LYDIA
                     Perhaps.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    I am all tumult like a waterfall.
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    You should lie still and sleep will come ere
                    long,
                    Sleep is so strange a thing.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Is it so strange?
                    I think the moving night is far more strange.
                    To you it has no motion and no sound;
                    To me it is a noisy, crowded street;
                    A city full of misty, moving shapes.
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    These things are in yourself. Be still awhile,
                    And you shall see how, like a loving nurse,
                    Sweet sleep will soothe and kiss your tired eyes.
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    [Taking a seat near the table]
                    
                        Last night I had a dream that was like death,
                        So terrible was the fear it wrought in me.
                        Thought I lay in there beside my husband
                    
                    [Pointing to the right]
                    
                        And slept, as was my joy in other times.
                        A hand plucked at my gown and wakened me;
                        And with my eyes wide open I beheld
                        My husband lying headless by my side
                        Thought I tried to move and cry aloud,
                        Yet could do naught but look upon his corpse.
                        Then it seemed we lay out in the garden,
                        Still side by side, his headless form and I;
                        And plainly could I hear his moaning voice
                        Come from the grassy earth!
                    
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    What said the voice?
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    I could not tell, so inarticulate
                    The sound, yet anger and a deep despair
                    Commingled strangely.
                
                
                
                    LYDIA
                     Were you much afraid?
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    
                        A hundred times I died within the dream,
                        It was as if his head rebelled its fate,
                        And sought to issue from the grassy earth.
                        I thought his pallid lips arose at last
                        And mingled with the leaves of tender green,
                        Which spat forth yellow flame and hissed the
                        while.
                        Then came that rolling sea of stormy dream
                        That drowns all sense of earthly form and
                        color,
                        A moving world of nothing seen or heard
                        Yet moving, swiftly rushing on and on.
                        When I awoke I should have cried aloud,
                        But terror held my throat and quenched the
                        sound.
                    
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    
                        Dear mistress, drive away these darkened
                        thoughts;
                        For all is still save now and then the wind
                        
                        That moves the leaves. The night was made
                        for sleep.
                        It is the cooling balm of fevered minds
                    
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    
                        What meaning can there be in such a dream?
                        Is it a message from the kinder gods
                        To give me warning of approaching ill?
                        Or does some dark corruption in myself
                        Make sick with fear this helmsman of my
                        sleep?
                    
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    No meaning can there be in hapless dreams.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Said you a wind was whining in the trees?
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    A gentle wind. I cannot hear it now.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    There! It is whining in the cypress trees.
                    [Goes to the window and looks out]
                
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    
                        Come, come, dear mistress, think such thoughts
                        no more.
                        Your eyes are bright as noon, but should be
                        dull,
                        That sleep might close them up.
                    
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    [Listening at the window]
                     Hear, Lydia!
                    It tells some sadden story fraught with pain.
                    The night awakes the slumbering things of
                    day.
                    Perhaps it is the wind now on his round
                    To wake the trees that babble through their
                    leaves.
                    This room is filled with living things by night;
                    They whisper in my ears, and some cry "hist!"
                    [Pointing to the bell suspended from the ceil-ing]
                    And, Lydia, that piece of hammered gold
                    Has more unending terror in its tongue
                    Than all the torments of the wicked dead.
                    How often it has called me forth to shame!
                    
                    I think each moment it will cry aloud
                    And send me forth to him, for 'tis the night
                    That I am wont to barter for my bread.
                    I am a harlot in my husband's house;
                    My body does he love but not my soul.
                    The food I eat is paid for by my flesh.
                    I cannot live through it another night;
                    My tongue will cry aloud against my will.
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    I would it pleased you more.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    [Startled]
                    What sound is that?
                
                
                     LYDIA
                    I hear no sound.

                    I heard it plainly--there!
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    Perhaps some slave is walking in his room.
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Perhaps some slave is walking in his sleep.
                    No, it is there, up in the gloomy trees--
                    A flutter as of wings.
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    I cannot hear.
                    Perhaps a bird has fallen from his nest.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    There are some birds that fly abroad at night
                    And sing a wailing song as from the tomb.

                    thoughts,

                    I would stay here and have you talk to me.
                    Again I hear the noise. O that my mind
                    Did cease to note each passing breath of sound!

                    Yes, I would know if he is fast asleep.
                    Then shall I yield myself unto the night;

                    Or when a little glutton you had been,
                    And stole the sweets that were forbidden you.
                    O would that we could live it all again!

                    Sometimes the child I was comes back to me,
                    And I stretch forth my arms to hold it fast.
                    For one brief moment all the world is changed:
                    The lure of twilight shadows in the evening,
                    The pallid gold of summer moons long past,

                    And I shall wake you with my hand to-night,
                    If some unwholesome dream distress your

                    And memory joined my childish hand to yours;
                    I saw the sky rest on a sleeping hill,
                    And heard the murmur of the meadow winds,
                    It was my dawn, my springtime morning hour.

                    So fragrant that it thrills me through.
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Wait, wait.
                    Listen! It is the whispers in the trees,
                    It is the moaning in the trees out there.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    'Tis but the wind that tosses up the leaves.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    I hear a sound more human-like than wind.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    [Goes to the window and looks out]
                    Nothing but moving air disturbs the night.
                    A little bird are you to frighten thus,
                    A little bird with burnished marble breast.
                    Come to me, sing your breath into my face;
                    Your breath like sweetened poison thrills me
                    through.

                    Wait, wait; I still am trembling in my limbs.
                    First tell me of the feast to-night.
                
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    The feast
                    As stupid as a race won ere 'tis run.
                    I would forget it and would feast with you.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Pray tell me what was said.

                    [Sits down]
                    But stupid things:
                    One told, with great gusto, an ancient tale
                    I heard when yet a boy; another, old
                    With wine and too much food, proclaimed his
                    ills,
                    A swelling every morning in his legs.
                    A youth talked much of love and much more
                    drank.
                    [Begins to arie]
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    No, no; there is much more to tell.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    Another,
                    
                    Our fat, complaining guest of yesternight,
                    Explained in great detail the foods he ate,
                    The foods he could not eat, in short, the virtues
                    Of his stomach and the perils of foods.
                    One ate too much of quince, grew deathly
                    Was taken home, and laughed at as he went.
                    All fools they were, more foolish made by
                    wine.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Was there no noble thought expressed?
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    Not one.
                    Yet I am little judge of noble thoughts.
                    My eyes are better trained than is my mind;
                    And when they look on you they see naught
                    else,
                    The world is strangely dimmed as if 'twould
                    rain.
                    Why are your lips so red, your flesh so white--
                    Whiter than lilies grown beneath a glass--
                    Whiter than marble brought from Africa?
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Always of my body, but not my soul
                    You speak.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    It is a sapling laurel tree,
                    And I a stormy wind that bends it down.
                    Your saffron hair is like Assyrian silk,
                    Like sheets of water that the winds distress.

                    More time--
                    To tell a fearful dream of yesternight.
                    I am your slave and ask more time.

                    That made you hide your head beneath your
                    wing?

                    As if the juice of upas trickled there.

                    A loathèd thing with foul and festered form

                    Barbarian spears have cruelly rent my fesh,

                    And perished memories look on me again.
                    A world of fancies was my boyish world,
                    And love was sky and earth and wind and

                    Love stirred ambition in my youthful breast,
                    And sent me forth to conquest and to gain.

                    Who with their eyes bade me to lead them
                    forth.
                    Barbarian maidens in Albanian lands,
                    With dreadful fear consumed, fell on my
                    breast,
                    Maidens fresh and fair as springtime morn-

                    With waving locks of midnight ebony,
                    And ruby-laden mistresses of kings,
                    Were as a bed of roses to be plucked.
                    Yet I kept myself for you.

                    A thousand dreadful battles have I fought,
                    And lain in swamps by the Hyrcanian Sea,
                    By deadly scorpions visited at night.
                    Thus gathered I the glitter of this house
                    These jewel-embellished lamps of beaten gold
                    Made bright the enamored evenings of a king.
                    Yon seven-fingered candlesticks of bronze
                    Burned in a temple at Jerusalem.
                    Sweet dreams of love upbore me on the night
                    I swam a moaning sea of poisoned spears
                    To bring this tapestry that's stiff with gold.
                    The grass of spring is not more tender green
                    Than is the jade embedded in these walls;
                    
                    Nor autumn leaves more yellow than the topaz.
                    See how the envious pearls, that sparkle not,
                    Make solemn faces at the shining stones.
                    That row of sapphire, soft as summer skies,
                    Lay on a youthful princess' snow-white breast.
                    All this I brought for you.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    To buy my body,
                    The food and drink your gourmand passion
                    craves.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    To please the heart of her I saw in dreams,
                    Who now repulses me. That citrus table,
                    Your snow-white fingers now are trembling on,
                    Came o'er the seas from Africa for you.
                    [She lifts her hand from the table]
                    Yon daggers, swords, and spears I bought with
                    blood;
                    Each one I wrenched from out the hand of
                    death.
                    I gave them you. They were my choicest gift.
                    The favorite maiden of the King of Pontus
                    Has worn that diamond that adorns your hair.
                    
                    'Tis like a dewdrop on a saffron rose.
                    [She takes the diamond from her hair and lays it on the
                        table]
                    That slender thread of scarlet pearls you wear
                    Has felt the warmth of fair Statonice's throat.
                    In all of Rome there is none like to it.
                    Once in a hundred years, I have been told,
                    The miser sea gives up a scarlet pearl.
                    [She takes the pearls from her throat]
                    Have I denied you aught?
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    No, by the gods,
                    That have you not. With gold and bronze
                    and pearl,
                    Well have you paid me o'er and o'er again
                    For every inch of my defenceless self.
                    By all the written laws I am your wife;
                    And being such, I am a loathed thing.
                    By signs and sounds of bells you summon me.
                    Submission takes the place of love's reward.
                    It is a world of flesh in which we live.
                    My yearning soul you have not sought to buy.
                    I would have given it for love alone.
                
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    Do I not love you?
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    You love my body.
                    You love the pleasure that I give to you.
                    When you are calm you have no need of
                    me;
                    And day and night I meditate alone.
                    Then in a frenzied heat you come to me;
                    And I but live to feed your maddened fire.
                    I am a sea your storm-winds beat upon.
                    I am the withered leaves your flames consume.
                    Your love is fire and straining wind and
                    storm;
                    Like wine, it wakes to lust your dead desire.
                    You dazzled me with gold and shining stones,
                    And led me to this house of lawful shame.
                    How am I better than the common women
                    Who sell themselves for shelter and for food?
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    Are you not my wife?
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    You wed my body,
                    But not my soul. What law can bind two
                    souls?
                    What ceremony pompous made with gold
                    Can lead the heart to go where it will not?
                    My timid flesh has tarried in this house;
                    But that in me which lived for love is dead
                    You, master, maker of my little world,
                    You sought it not.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    'Tis late to note this now.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    What did I know of life upon that morn
                    You led me from my father's house, a child.
                    My nurse, the sky, my poets had taught me
                    dreams.
                    I thought you loved my soul.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    I loved your soul?
                    
                    Can burning lips be cooled upon the soul
                    What is this love of things one cannot touch?
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    O would that I could form it into words
                    And give it understanding in your mind!
                    'Tis soft and low and sweet and clamors not.
                    'Tis like the light of stars in quiet night,
                    A hush and stillness of the world within.
                    'Tis bountiful as is the harvest time
                    With mellow fruit, and yields ere it is asked.
                    It is like gentle springtime when the earth
                    Of her own self, unforced, yields up the grass.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    Your soul then would I wed. Teach me this
                    love.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    'Tis learned not in the twinkling of an eye.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    I will be patient, teach me step by step.
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    O, I have meditated in the night
                    When silence almost murmured like a sound!
                    And gazing long into the lighted sky,
                    I thought the stars came slowly down to me;
                    Then upward through the soft and darkened
                    world
                    I went with them unto the ends of space.
                    With you this flight of soul had been divine.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    I will go through the universe with you.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    And often in the night I would you came
                    With heavy heart that I might comfort you.
                    I would you told me of some secret grief
                    And found surcease of sorrow on my breast.
                    In evening's quiet hour, beneath the trees,
                    With eagerness I'd listen to your plans;
                    And we should wander in one world of thought.
                    When lonely night comes on I'd sleep by you,
                    So near that I might touch you with my hand.
                    
                    And children would I bear that have your
                    image;
                    And you would ache as I in pain brought forth
                    Sweet roses in the garden of my breast
                    Appealing lips that cry and press for drink,
                    Whose faintest smile makes sweet a bitter
                    world.
                    My unborn children have I seen at night
                    And heard their feeble cries to be brought
                    forth,
                    That they might know the glory that it is
                    To live and see the world with human eyes.
                    At night they whisper in the cypress trees
                    And cry aloud to me to be their mother.
                    But we have murdered them--my little child-
                    dren!
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    You sadden me with grief till now unknown.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    I would not pain you, but my heart is hurt.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    You should have been a mother.
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    You would not
                    Forgo your pleasure for a season brief.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    [Rising]
                    There still is time.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Not till you love my soul.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    Your words are piercing as a slender sword.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    At first I feared you. Now no more I fear
                    For sorrow sits upon your heavy soul
                    And darkens all the chambers of your house.
                    It will draw me to you again.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    You will
                    Not flee from me if I come to you now?
                    [Takes her in his arms]
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    No, kiss me not until I come to you:
                    And then we two shall wander through the
                    world;
                    And you will know the bliss of loving me,
                    When I shall breathless run into your arms.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    I would that now your lips were touching
                    mine.
                    Mine are a burning field and yours a rain,
                    A famished beggar gazing on a feast.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    No, no; not yet; my heart still beats in pain.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    O, loath am I so soon to let you go!
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Love but my soul, the part of me not flesh,
                    And you shall see my body run to you.
                
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    The dawn of this new love breaks through my
                    night.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Be patient, not so quickly is it taught;
                    Yet am I filled with joy that you will learn,
                    That you will sit with me in night's still hours,
                    And live with me your life of thought, as
                    mine
                    Henceforth I live with you. What sound is
                    this
                    That like sweet music trembles through the
                    night?
                    [Faint music is heard]
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    I bade my servants softly touch the lute
                    When I had been with you a measured time,
                    That I, returning, might he cheered by sound.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    [Drawing slowly away from him]
                    
                    This is a new caprice your hunger craves.
                    Yet sweet this whispered music in the night;
                    It brings some cheer into my heart.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    [Seeing her night robe lying on the chair]
                    Your robe!
                    O, put it on before I go, that I
                    May look on you in all your loveliness!
                    For one brief moment fill my eyes with light,
                    For I am stricken blind and see you not.
                    You are the sun of all my darkened world.
                    I have been patient and will learn this love
                    You told me of. See how I plead with
                    you,
                    Like some vile beggar at your outer door--
                    I who but yesterday was master here;
                    I thirst for you; I hunger for your beauty.
                    My eyes alone will feel you with their sight.
                    I have known sabre wounds that were a touch
                    Beside the mortal hurt of all your words.
                    O, put it on that I forget my wounds!

                    I bring you only grief. Your plaintive words
                    Are heavy with their sorrow.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    Put it on,
                    And be the goddess of my heart's own world
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    I am no goddess, but am still your wife.
                
                
                    MAROBIUS

                    I would be loved.
                
                
                
                    MAROBIUS
                    It is the breaking dawn of love's new day.
                    Your wondrous beauty mirrored on my eyes,
                    I'll wander off to sleep and dream of you.

                    CLODIA
                    And as the days come on shall we two learn
                    The bliss of our new love?

                    MAROBIUS
                    And in the morning twilight kiss your lips,
                    Subdued by love that first is passionless.
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    And sometimes in the watches of the night,
                    We two shall meditate upon the gods,
                    And think how beautiful it is to live.

                    And will you gladly climb with me
                    The peaceful mountains made of lofty thoughts
                    That lie serenely in the soul?

                    Else will I tear your flesh and make you bleed.
                    
                    You are my wife; my wife shall be my wife!
                    [There is a loud cry within, then silence. CLODIA, white and trembling, renters, and LYDIA
                        enters from the opposite side]
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    What noise? I thought I heard some one cry
                    out.
                    There's blood upon your wrist!
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    [Whispering]
                     I scratched myself.
                    Speak not so loud lest you wake up the house.
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    The master--where is he--asleep?
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    Asleep.
                    Bring me my sable robe.
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    At such an hour?
                    'Tis not yet dawn.
                
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    We two are going home.
                    Do quickly what I bid.
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    Ere he awakes?
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    [Gazing fixdly at the door at left]
                    He will awake. I see him coming. Go!
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    I do not see him--where?
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    [Frantically]
                    My robe--go quickly!
                    There--there, his eyes, his voice--you hear him?
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    No.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    He murmurs--hear! He murmurs in his sleep.
                    His lips are moving--see!
                
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    [Caressing her]
                    I see no one.
                    You dream again. Be still, else will he wake.
                    He sleeps so soundly now.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    He soundly sleeps.
                    My mind is full of fancies. Fetch my robe!
                    What noise was that out there--out there?
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    The wind.
                
                
                    CLODIA
                    It sounded like a noise from human lips.
                    Hear--hear the voices; all the house is roused!
                    I hear a rush of maddened slaves.
                
                
                    LYDIA
                    Be calm,
                    The house is still.

                    My robe--run quickly--fetch my robe!

                    [Hurries of at right]
                    I go.
