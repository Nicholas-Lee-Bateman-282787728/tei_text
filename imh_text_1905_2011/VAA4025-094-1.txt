            Educational opportunities in pre-public school, pre-Civil War Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , Indiana, included missionary, district, county, private venture, and denominational
                    schools. Neither public nor private as those terms are understood today, most of these schools
                    operated on monies from several sources; most also required students to pay a subscription rate, or
                    tuition. In their own way the schools represented different responses to the needs of a growing,
                    increasingly diverse community. Teachers, a varied group that could only loosely be designated
                    professional, operated to a great extent as entrepreneurs. In the 1850s and 1860s, however, as
                    public schools—also called free schools or common schools—began to supplant
                    these earliest educational ventures, organization and financing of schools, work lives of teachers,
                    and composition of the educational work force changed dramatically. A study of schooling as it
                    developed in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     in the first half of the nineteenth century, with a particular focus on teachers and
                    their conditions of work, provides a new perspective on the development of teaching as a profession,
                    on the growth of public education in Indiana and the nation as a whole, and on current debates about
                    the future of public education.
            Educational historians have long been interested in the question of what social, economic, political,
                    cultural, and ideological forces encouraged the emergence of public schooling in the 
                        United States
                     in the mid-nineteenth century.1 Scholars have linked the
                    introduction of common schools to industrialization, immigration, and urbanization, as well as to
                    the expansion of the state in the nineteenth century, changes in the role of the family, and the
                    spread of markets and

                            . Research for this study was funded by a CLIO grant from the Indiana Historical
                            Society,

                            education in Indiana by William J. Reese in "Indiana's Public School Traditions:

                                United States
                            , see Lawrence A. Cremin, American Education: The National
                                Experience, 1783-1876
                  
               
                     the wage-labor system.2 These views, which
                    tie political and cultural developments more explicitly to the evolving economic system, are
                    particularly helpful for studying teachers as an emerging labor force. An examination of the history
                    of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's teachers helps to explain if and how the evolution of the teaching profession was a
                    part of the development of a national market economy. Although Fort 
                        Wayne
                     was a small settlement at the time that larger, older cities were in the forefront of
                    economic, cultural, industrial, and educational expansion, its history parallels on a less grand
                    scale the developments in larger cities. Because of the city's relatively smaller size, changes in
                    its educational labor force are all the more visible.
            In northern Indiana the land that is now Fort 
                        Wayne
                     served, successively, various Native American groups, the French, and the British. In
                    1794 Americans, under General Anthony 
                        Wayne
                    , established the first 
                        United States
                     fort there and gave the city its name.3 What came to be a midsized,
                    industrializing city in the nineteenth century had been at the crossroads of trade from its earliest
                    days as a military outpost and fur trading center on the edge of the frontier. Indiana became a
                    state in 1816, and on April 19, 1819, the fort at Fort 
                        Wayne
                     passed from military to civil authority. In 1822 Congress opened the area for public
                    sale of lands, excluding the forty acres of the fort. The relatively cheap land enticed new
                    settlers. Internal improvements in transportation, from plank roads and canals in the 1830s and
                    1840s to railroads in the 1850s, kept Fort 
                        Wayne

                        Wayne
                    's population doubled, and its capital investment quadrupled. Native Americans and
                    French and American settlers from eastern and southern states populated the area in the earliest
                    years. In the 1830s and 1840s German, Irish, and French immigrants were attracted to jobs,
                    particularly those related to the internal improvements. Farming opportunities also attracted
                    settlers, as did the numerous and varied religious congregations.4
            
            Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's economic development in the mid-nineteenth century came to be more industrial and
                    more influenced by northern states' trade and immigration patterns than were cities in middle and
                    southern Indiana. Educationally, however, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     shared a common heritage with other Hoosiers and other mid-westerners. As Indiana
                    evolved out of the Northwest Territory, it inherited the educational legacy spelled out in the Land
                    Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The 1785 legislation allocated for the
                    purposes of education the land (or the proceeds from lease or sale thereof) in section sixteen of
                    each congressional township; that is, one square mile in a six-square-mile township. The Northwest
                    Ordinance further declared: "Schools and the means of education shall forever be
                        encouraged."5 The enabling legislation for Indiana statehood in
                    1816 included the essence of these ordinances, and many communities throughout the state established
                    small, one-room district schools. Money from the sixteenth section was frequently insufficient to
                    support such schools, however, thus most also charged a subscription fee. Private venture,
                    entrepreneurial, and denominational schools emerged simultaneously, especially in towns and cities;
                    almost certainly they, too, received section sixteen—or public—funds. Until
                    states explicitly allowed cities to establish separate school systems, a change that came in Indiana
                    with the common school legislation of the 1850s, educational opportunities in towns and villages
                    were much the same as those in rural areas, and schools were funded in much the same way. In
                    communities such as Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , where the population was rapidly expanding and diversifying, citizens found

                     it particularly difficult to provide enough schools and to
                    attract qualified teachers.6
            
            In Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , as was the case in most frontier communities, missionaries established the first
                    formal schools.7 Following a request from the local Miami chief to the 
                        United States
                     government, Quakers from 
                        Baltimore
                     in 1804 organized an expedition to the Three Rivers area in Indiana to teach the Miami
                    how to farm. Unfortunately, the lands to be cultivated for teaching purposes were located at least a
                    day's ride from the fort, and able-bodied young Miami men considered farming women's work. The
                    experiment failed.8
            
            On May 29, 1820, a year after the fort passed from military to civil authority, Isaac McCoy, a
                    Baptist missionary, set up a small, short-lived school in the council house of the emptied fort.
                    McCoy had been appointed by the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions but received little financial
                    support from it. He sent out appeals for money to individuals and to the federal and state
                    governments; all eventually responded. Although McCoy's intent was to teach Native American
                    children, his first class of twenty-five pupils included ten English scholars, six French, eight
                    Indians, and one African American. Those numbers reached forty-two by the end of the year.9
            
            Staffing, as well as funding, problems plagued McCoy from the start. In the course of time that McCoy
                    ran the school, his wife and other teachers assisted with instruction.10 They
                    conducted the school

                according to the Lancastrian method, an early model for mass education that depended on
                    older student monitors instructing smaller groups under strict supervision. The McCoys also taught
                    some "industrial" skills, such as farming to the boys and sewing and other
                    household arts to the girls. The work was hard; turnover among the hired help, that is, teachers to
                    assist with the school and artisans to help with the industrial skills, was high. McCoy had
                    particular trouble recruiting Baptist teachers and was forced to hire non-Baptists and nonbelievers.
                    The school folded in December, 1822, when McCoy, plagued by financial worries, took up another

            A husband and wife team who had taught for McCoy then began their own private school in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . They initiated a pattern of teaching—instruction by individual teachers or
                    pairs of teachers— that would survive for the next thirty years.12
                    Hugh B. McKeen, who had arrived from 
                        Detroit
                     soon after McCoy departed, taught a small school in the fort during part of 1823 and
                    1824 before becoming engaged in trade with the Indians.13 In 1825 a private
                    teacher, Henry Cooper, taught in the crudely furnished upper floor of a log jail. Cooper's career
                    was typical of many men teachers at that time. Originally from 
                        Baltimore
                    , he studied navigation in preparation for a seafaring life. After a time at sea he gave
                    up that life and left for 
                        Cincinnati
                     to study law. In 1825 he moved to Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , where he continued his legal studies and also taught school before being admitted to
                    the bar in 1829. Thereafter he had an extensive practice before the Circuit and Supreme courts of
                    Indiana and the 
                        United States
                    .14 For men such as Cooper, teaching was a sideline and a means of
                    support while apprenticing in law.15
            
            Indiana's Constitution of 1816 provided for county seminaries that were to be funded by revenues
                    received for military exemptions and fines collected for violation of penal laws in the counties in
                    which the schools were established. Although the state later added monies from forfeited bonds to
                    the seminaries' revenues, funding was woefully insufficient.16 In 1825 a county
                    seminary was built in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . Although 
                        Allen County
                     received the funds allotted by the Constitution, most support came from tuition, as was
                    true for most of the county seminaries. The cost of fuel was added to the tuition charges.17 The seminary's first teacher, John P. Hedges, had arrived in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     in 1812 and had been active "in affairs of the day," as was also
                    typical for young men who became teachers.18 In 1819 he, and one of the original
                    proprietors of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , John McCorkle, "supplied beef and bread to the Indians at Fort 
                        Wayne
                     while they were awaiting their annuity payments." At the time Hedges taught,
                    he possibly doubled as sheriff.19 Hedges was followed during the next ten years
                    at the seminary by men who taught for a year or so before going on to other professions or public
                    life in Fort 
                        Wayne

            While the county seminary was operating, the city of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     made its own meager attempts to step into the educational arena. In 1835 Fort 
                        Wayne
                     town trustees appointed two men to employ teachers "on terms advantageous to
                    the corporation." None could be found on such terms, it was reported in 1836, so the matter
                    was dropped.22
            
            In the spring of 1836 two young women came to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     to set up a private school. The circumstances of their coming, their changing situation

                  privately at the Masonic Hall. While at the county seminary Aughenbaugh, a Catholic, gave
                            religious instruction to Catholic children in his spare time. He left teaching the following
                            year to go into the tanning business. Smalwood Noel, later an elder in the First
                            Presbyterian Church and a justice of the peace, taught in the seminary in 1834 and James

                        Wayne
                     at the time, as well as about the sources of support for education. Susan Man, later
                    Mrs. Hugh McCulloch, and Alida Hubbell, later Mrs. Royal Taylor, opened a school on July 5, 1836, in
                    a room in the 
                        Allen County
                     Courthouse.23 Their teaching careers were typical of those of other
                    young women teachers in the Midwest before the Civil War.24 The young women had
                    met in 
                        Connecticut
                     at the 
                        Hartford
                     Female Seminary, established by Catharine Beecher, where they had spent two winters
                    studying to be teachers. Alida's brother, Woolsey Hubbell, was a teller at Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's branch of the State Bank of Indiana. Two of the bank's board of directors, Samuel
                    Hanna and Allen 
                        Hamilton
                    , who were also two of the city's, and later the state's, most prosperous and
                    influential citizens, were anxious to see an academy started to improve educational opportunities in
                    Fort 
                        Wayne
                    .25 They had Hubbell send his father a letter asking if his sister,
                    Alida, and her friend, Susan Man, could come to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     to teach, under the care of the bank directors, Hanna and 
                        Hamilton
                    . Susan, eager to go, wrote her parents that this was not "a romantic freak or
                    wild notion" for she had thought about it seriously and believed it was her duty to go:
                    "I have been living for self long enough and I think it is high time that I use my
                    advantages for the promotion of the Gospel…,"26 The two
                    women started their school with seventeen scholars, about half of whom were Catholic, but who,
                    according to Man, made "no objection to reading in and learning a verse in the testament
                    every morning." The women charged $2.50 per quarter for reading scholars,
                    $4.00 for writing and the higher studies, and $6.00 extra for painting.27
            
            No sooner had the school established itself than the young women closed it to work instead for Jesse
                    Hoover, a Lutheran minister who opened his own seminary in August, 1836, in the basement

                of the Presbyterian church, the first church in Fort 
                        Wayne

                    . The school welcomed children of all faiths. Like the young women, Hoover had been
                    recruited to come to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     by one of the city's prominent businessmen, German Lutheran Henry Rudisill. Hoover
                    supplemented a modest stipend from the American Home Mission Society by taking in boarders and
                    organizing the tuition school. The Lutherans had as yet no church building of their own, and the
                    Presbyterians had no minister; Hoover preached to both on a provisional basis from the Presbyterian
                    church building.28

            Working for Hoover was easier than running an independent school, according to Man. Also, the
                    basement room in the church was "a beautiful room for a school," for it was
                    "fitted up with oaken desks and walls painted for a blackboard so that there will be plenty
                    of room for Arithmetic and Maps." Susan reported that she and Alida got along well in the
                    school for "Mr. Hoover lets us have our own way as much as we could in an independent
                        school."29 Although operating out of a church and run by a minister
                    assisted by young teachers who saw opportunities for "promoting the gospel," the
                    school was not affiliated with a specific church. Religion was, however, central to its curriculum.
                    Man relates that Hoover opened and closed the school each day with prayers. "The scholars
                    all meet in his room in the morning. After prayer we take our scholars into our own room and teach
                    them until it is time to close." The women teachers were each paid $250.00,
                    "part in advance for two terms five months each."30
            
            Even though their pay was modest, the young women felt successful in their teaching, appreciated by
                    their students, and accepted by the community. To save money they boarded 'round, as was the
                    practice for teachers then, with families whose children attended the school. Man explained that
                    they paid "$2-1/2 per week for our board & get our washing done as we
                    can, sometimes we do it ourselves and sometimes get it done at the rate of 75 cts. a dozen. I think
                    we shall just about pay our way home next summer—and have very little left."31 Man, however, felt rewarded by the students' learning. 
                        I think the parents of the children appear satisfied and I think they improve rapidly.
                            Everything appears new and interesting to them that relates to their studies. They knew
                            nothing of the Geography or history of their own country when we commenced teaching and of
                            course, they are very much interested when they are explained to them. I have a large class
                            in Geography and in history of the 
                                United States
                             who have never studied either before, and when they draw their maps I ask them
                            to point out such places as are mentioned in history, and tell them anecdotes about them.32
                  
                     A former student of the two young women claimed that they "did away with the raw
                    hides and hickory goads that the male teachers had in their schools. The ladies were successful and
                    well liked by their pupils."33 The women enjoyed an active social life
                    filled with callers, parties, teas, and church-related activities. They appear to have been included
                    in the social functions of all the most prominent families of the then still small town.34
            
            The opening of other tuition schools posed a threat to the profitability, as well as to the very
                    existence, of Hoover's school. In the spring of 1837 Man notes that their school had new
                    competition:

            Hoover was succeeded at the school in the Presbyterian church by William W. Steevens, a
                    non-denominational minister from 
                        England
                    , and Alexander McJunkin, a defrocked Presbyterian minister.38 Soon,
                    however, Steevens and his wife built a house and opened the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Select Classical Academy.39 He explains that he taught
                    "the things that pertain to this world 5 days in the week—those which belong to
                    the world to come on one day in the week—leaving one day (Saturday) for casual
                    business." In 1844 Steevens describes a life that was free from want: "Provision
                    is so cheap that the poorest can obtain a plenty."40 Though he felt
                    well provided for, payment was often "in kind." 
                        For the last four years I have taken but very little money—It will fill this sheet
                            to explain how people live here—We build houses—buy
                            land—food—raiment—horses— carriages, in short,
                            almost everything you can conceive of with money—We barter… Per
                            example I have this very day taken a note for a tuition fee payable in stone
                                suited for mason work [and] another to be paid in painters work, some in goods from
                            the stores—these things we trade around among ourselves and get anything we
                                want.41
                  
                     Steevens eventually became an attorney and formed a law partnership. By 1858 he was serving
                    as a justice of the peace in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    .42
            
            Alexander McJunkin also left the school in the Presbyterian church to build a house, where he taught
                    privately until 1853. He is remembered as an esteemed teacher, a "fine scholar, a strong
                    judicious instructor and a stern rigidly strict disciplinarian," who, unlike Man and
                    Hubbell, "most forcibly impressed his ideas and teachings upon the minds of his scholars
                    and not infrequently with equal force upon their bodies." He left teaching in 1853 to
                    become treasurer of the 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , Fort 
                        Wayne

                     Railway Company.43
            
            Steevens and McJunkin were teaching privately in the 1840s when Miss M. L. Wallace opened the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Female Seminary in October, 1843; Misses H. M. Raymond and L. M. Love joined her in
                    1844. The female seminary included primary, junior, and senior departments at, respectively,
                    $3.00, $4.00, and $5.00 per quarter, with vocal music offered to
                    all free of charge. Wallace listed as references: Henry Rudisill, Samuel Hanna, and Allen 
                        Hamilton
                    —the same businessmen 
                  
                     38 Alexander McJunkin had been excommunicated prior to his arrival in
                            Fort

                             because he allegedly had been engaged to three women at the same time while
                            being married to another. He denied the allegations and continued teaching in spite of them.

            In the fall of 1845 Mrs. Lydia A. Sykes opened a Ladies' Seminary under the auspices of the
                    Presbyterian church. The Presbyterians had recently split into Old and New School divisions. Old
                    School Presbyterians started the school, but the school's board had ministers from both
                    congregations. The board also included ministers from other churches and prominent citizens such as,
                    among others, Rud-isill, 
                        Hamilton
                    , and McCulloch. In April, 1846, Sykes was joined by her daughter, Amanda E. Sykes, who
                    had graduated from the female academy in Steubenville, 
                        Ohio
                    , where her mother had taught for seven years before coming to Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . Lydia Sykes's health soon failed, and a Presbyterian minister replaced her until June,
                    1847, when he, too, opened his own academy.45

            In the early months of 1846 another educational initiative flickered and died. Citizens met to
                    discuss the establishment of a permanent female seminary in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , but nothing came of it.46
            
            In 1853 a Presbyterian academy was again opened by the First Presbyterian Church (Old School) under
                    the charge of George A. Irvin, a college graduate who had previously run a ladies' seminary in 
                        Kentucky
                    . Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's public schools also opened in 1853 but closed in 1854 for lack of funds and support.
                    When they were reopened in 1857, Irvin, now the Reverend George A. Irvin, was hired to be the first
                    superintendent of schools.47 The Presbyterian academy was temporarily suspended,
                    but it was reopened and continued with varying success until 1867 when it was abandoned because the
                    public schools "were more economically carrying out its objects."48 The lots were sold to the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     school trustees, and the Presbyterian academy became a Fort 
                        Wayne
                     public school.49
            
            In the 1840s Catholics also tried to organize schools and attract teachers and students. In 1843 a
                    young French-born priest, Julian Benoit of St. Augustine's Catholic Church, arranged to have Holy
                    Cross brothers teach in his St. Augustine's Institute. When they quit, he hired a lay schoolmaster,
                    William B. Walter, to open St. Augustine's Academy in the fall of 1844. By 1845 there were
                    eighty-four students, thirty girls and fifty-four boys, including four Protestants. St. Augustine's
                    advertised that instruction was not "select or sectarian." It was also less
                    expensive than other schools. The price for that year had been reduced to $1.75 per
                    quarter for the English branches, $3.00 for the classical, and $5.00 for
                    drawing and painting; but further reductions were made when there was "liberal patronage,
                    or where the circumstances of some may require it." The following semester the prices were
                    again reduced—"solely with an eye to the exclusion of none
                    from the great blessings of education"—as the school also tried to compete with
                    the city's other schools. Walter continued in the boys' school until 1847 when Father Benoit again
                    hired brothers from religious orders to teach. The school was abandoned in 1851.50 Three nuns from the Sisters of

                    Catholic schools began to grow.51
            
            In 1846 the first moves were made toward the formation of a Methodist college, and the first classes
                    commenced in the fall of 1847. Promoters included Methodists and their clergy, representatives from
                    other congregations, and public-spirited, influential private citizens, such as, again, McCulloch,
                    Hanna, and Rudisill. After several changes of name and location it survives today as Taylor
                        University.52
            
            The Episcopalians, like the Presbyterians, Lutherans, and Catholics, encouraged their clergy to
                    establish schools. Joseph S. Large, the minister of Trinity Episcopal Church, started a day school
                    for boys in 1851. The church gave him land on which to build a school-house

                     but no financial support. Large had taught school in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     before studying theology. The school lasted until Large resigned his position and moved
                    to 
                        California
                     in 1854.53 In 1858 the Episcopalians hired as their minister
                    Stephen H. Battin, who served for five years. During this time he and his daughter, Kate, ran a day
                    and boarding school for young ladies out of his home. Battin had hoped to become superintendent of
                    the public schools in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     in 1863, when Superintendent George A. Irvin resigned to become a chaplain in the

            Other congregations initiated religious schooling for their children but expanded the scope to
                    include all subjects. In the mid-1850s a small Jewish community appointed their newly hired cantor
                    to teach religious doctrine and Hebrew to children several times a week. In 1856 Mayer Eppstein, a
                    retired professional teacher of Hebrew and German from a synagogue school in 
                        Germany
                    , took over the teaching of religion, Hebrew, and German. An English instructor was also
                    hired. The school was originally supported by the parents, but in 1860 the congregation took over
                    basic expenses. By 1864 the congregation threw its support behind the public schools. The Jewish
                    school continued, but only as a religious school on Sundays and after school hours.55
            
            Other small schools taught by individual teachers or pairs of teachers came and went during the
                    1830s, 1840s, and 1850s; all had trouble retaining teachers and students.56
                    Their insecure financial bases, the undeveloped teaching profession, and competition for students
                    and teachers undermined the future of these varied schools.
            In 1848 56 percent of the voters in Indiana supported a proposal to establish public schools
                    throughout the state. In Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , as was typical of cities in northern Indiana, almost 75 percent approved,57 yet the state legislature passed no enabling legislation. In 1851 a new
                    Indiana constitution provided the groundwork for legislation that established an administrative
                    structure, as well as the funding, for a system of public schools. Civil townships were to be the
                    new unit of administration. The former congressional township funds would go to the state, not
                    directly to the townships, as had previously been the case. The state would then distribute the
                    funds according to student attendance in each township. Townships had new powers to tax, as did
                    cities and towns, which could form separate school corporations. The change from congressional
                    townships to civil townships

                     proved confusing. Opposition arose over the new method of
                    distributing the former congressional township funds and over the new local taxing powers. Both
                    measures were contested in court and were eventually found unconstitutional, to the dismay of such
                    public school advocates as Caleb Mills, the architect of the state's public school law and
                    superintendent of public instruction for the state of Indiana from 1854 to 1857. As cases came to
                    court and new laws were written throughout the late 1850s and early 1860s, Indiana's public schools,
                    including those in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , struggled to survive.58
            
            In 1853 Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's city council selected three prominent citizens to be trustees for the public schools:
                    Hugh McCulloch, promoter of schools in their many forms since the mid-1830s; Charles Case; and
                    William Stewart. The trustees rented former teacher Alexander McJunkin's school building on the east
                    side of town for $50.00 per quarter. They employed, for $150.00 per quarter,
                    the private teachers then teaching there, Isaac Mahurin and his sister, Mathilda L. Mahurin, as,
                    respectively, principal and assistant. On the west side they employed, for $150.00 per
                    quarter, Mr. and Mrs. A. N. Hulbard, who were teaching in their home. The Hulbards also received
                    $25.00 rent. Both schools opened in September, 1853.59
            
            Shortly thereafter, the school board resigned, or at least ceased to meet, possibly because some Fort 
                        Wayne
                     citizens unexpectedly turned against the city council for planning to tax them to raise
                    $1,200 for school sites. Some taxpayers opposed the new taxing power of the city, as well
                    as the at-large instead of representational method that the city council used to appoint school
                    board trustees. A new school board was formed, but, as the battle over how to fund the schools
                    continued at the local level as well as in the state courts, the schools in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     closed on March 24, 1854, at the end of their first year. Students returned to their
                    former non-public school teachers.60

                     over the power of the city council to levy school taxes and to appoint a school board
                    reflected economic, political, religious, and ethnic divisions in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     as well as throughout Indiana. The Democratic party, then in the majority in the city,
                    included German and French Catholics and some German Lutherans who favored the dissemination of the
                    school funds to sectarian

                     schools, a policy that the 1852 school law prohibited. Various
                    factions of the fragmenting Whig party favored public schools, as did, increasingly, various
                    Protestant churches, who feared growing Catholic immigration and the spread of Catholicism and saw
                    free schools as a way to counter both.61 The Whig group included most of the
                    "public spirited" citizens—businessmen, lawyers, and
                    clergy—who had been instrumental in initiating private venture and denominational schools
                    before the advent of public schools.
            Teachers were not disinterested bystanders. Catholic schoolmaster Walter spoke ardently for the
                    dissemination of the school funds to sectarian schools. Two of the first public schoolteachers, A.
                    N. Hulbard and Isaac Mahurin, both of whom had also taught in private schools, worked with free
                    school supporters in 1853 to promote the cause. Superintendent George A. Irvin, a Presbyterian
                    minister, expressed anti-Catholic fears and was an aggressive proponent of public schools.62
            
            Although the public schools were closed from 1854 to 1857, the board of trustees pursued the building
                    of two schools. One opened in February and the other in the fall of 1857. Because of continuing
                    strife within the city, mirrored statewide, over the legality of taxing for schooling, private
                    funding was successfully solicited in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     in 1858 to maintain the public schools. Ten citizens mortgaged their homes for
                    $500 each. The appeal for financial contributions failed in 1859, however, and the
                    schools in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     were again closed from May, 1859, to January, 1860, during which time the teachers were
                    allowed to run private schools in the public school buildings. The public schools reopened in
                    January, 1860, but were not financially sound until 1865 when a new school law was written for
                        Indiana.63
            
            In 1863, when Professor E. S. Green replaced Irvin as superintendent of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's public schools, Isaac and Matilda Mahurin were still teaching. Other teachers,

                            broader state and national political issues such as temperance and the extension of slavery
                            to new states; all were related to the growing regulatory power of the state.

                    teachers: eleven single women, two married women, and four men. Their teaching covered a range of
                    "grades" grouped into primary, secondary, intermediate, grammar, and high school
                        departments.64 In 1865 James H. Smart replaced Green and served for the next
                    ten years,65 during which time the educational system outlined by the
                    legislature during the 1850s began to be realized. Smart expanded the number of elementary schools;
                    continued hiring young women teachers, as had the first two superintendents; built a high school;
                    graded the schools from twenty-eight to fourteen grades; started a training school for teachers
                    within the public school system; and, in general, set the framework for turning the schools into a
                    "modern" system. In 1854 there were four public school teachers in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , the Mahurins and Hulbards, with 400 students; in 1857 fifteen teachers with 805
                    students; in 1864 nineteen teachers with 1,400 students; in 1868, after three years of Smart's
                    leadership, thirty-four teachers with 2,181 students.66 Teachers were paid a
                    fixed wage, determined by training, experience, and grade level taught; and rules of conduct,
                    attendance, and assessment were determined and codified for both teachers and students.67

                    Attempts to establish publicly supported schools failed in 1836, 1846, and 1854, as had
                    entrepreneurial and denominational alternatives during the same time period. Many of the men
                    involved in the civic and private ventures were also the men who eventually served in some capacity
                    in financing or overseeing the first public schools.68

                     also leading public school advocates.69
                    Their efforts to promote subscription and denominational as well as public schools during the 1830s
                    and 1840s had shown that education could not depend on the initiative of private teachers or
                    religious congregations or even on partially funded district and county schools. The population of
                    Fort 
                        Wayne
                     was growing, the economy industrializing, the need for a literate society increasing,
                    and the demand for education expanding. There was, however, no clear route to teaching as a
                    profession, no consistent way of insuring payment to teachers, thus no way of retaining teachers to
                    maintain consistent educational opportunities.
            In Indiana the legal framework for public schools was set in 1852, but the system progressed by fits
                    and starts, going back and forth from public to private venture, entrepreneurial, or denominational,
                    from publicly paid teachers to teachers paid according to other arrangements. Not until after the
                    Civil War did public schools in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , and in Indiana, operate on firm legal and financial footing. By the late 1860s and
                    1870s many of the subscription and denominational schools had folded or merged with the public
                    schools. Only the Catholic and Lutheran schools survived in what became parallel systems to the
                    public schools, systems that still thrive in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    .70
            
            Before public schools, teaching as a "profession" was defined by those with
                    literary skills, which teachers exchanged for money or equivalents in kind. In Fort 
                        Wayne
                     some subscription school teachers, both women and men, as exemplified by Man and
                    Steevens, lived quite well. Most had no specific training for teaching. A few women had received
                    some higher education at the then new women's schools in the East, others at female academies
                    throughout the Midwest; men had received training in theology, law, or business.
                    "Careers" in education were, for the most part, short, as tradition led men and

                            , the limited evidence that has emerged about them indicates that further study
                            could prove helpful in understanding the complicated legal, legislative, and financial
                            maneuvering that accompanied the birth of public schools. In Fort

                             the public school system was shepherded into being by a group of locally
                            prominent men who belonged to English-speaking religious congregations—most often
                            Presbyterian or the reformed wing of other denominations—and who were usually
                            Whigs, very successful bankers and businessmen, and community-minded activists and
                            politicians.

                            , Catholic and Lutheran schools, in the long run, proved most successful because
                            they had, as the other schools did not, a ready supply of students with a clearly defined
                            religious reason for attending a particular school; often a shared language other than
                            English; teachers who were supported by the church; and administrators who were highly
                            trained and remained in their positions long enough to oversee the development of the
                            schools.
               
                     free of charge; the Catholic schools advertised their cheaper
                    rates, with further reductions for families with more than one child attending. By 1853 there were
                    many private venture and denominational schools in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , and the public schools had to enter the competition for scholars and teachers.
            During the first half of the nineteenth century lines between public, private, and denominational
                    schools were almost nonexistent. McCoy's missionary school took money from denominational, public,
                    and individual sources. The county seminary, a public institution, charged tuition, as did most
                    other schools. The school that opened in the Presbyterian church included religion in its
                    curriculum, but it was first taught by a Lutheran minister. The school also welcomed children of all
                    faiths, as did the Catholic schools. Teachers, such as Man and Hubbell, moved easily from a private
                    venture school to a denominational school. Some ministers, such as Hoover, taught in schools not of
                    their own faith or, as the Reverends Steevens, McJunkin, Large, and Battin, opened their own private
                    schools. Presbyterian minister Irvin, who headed the Presbyterian academy, was hired to be the first
                    superintendent of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's public schools. Battin, an Episcopalian minister, coveted Irvin's position when Irvin
                    resigned. Later the Presbyterians sold their school to the public schools, as would several other
                    denominations. Some of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's public schools were set up in what had been private venture schools, and a number of
                    teachers in those schools were hired as Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's first public school teachers.
            The teaching profession, as it is defined today, began to evolve with the advent of the public
                    schools. Increasingly, young, single women were hired to fill the new age-graded public schools in
                    Fort 
                        Wayne
                     and throughout the country.71 Before the establishment of the
                    public school system, "young," "single," and
                    "female" were not criteria for teaching in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . Although some young, single women did teach, so did married women, widowed women, and
                    single and married men. Men and women often worked together out of their homes—or a
                    schoolhouse, courthouse, jail, or church—as husband-wife, father-daughter,
                    brother-sister, sister-sister, or mother-daughter teams. Marital and family relationships helped to
                    define the work force.
            Educational historians have examined the complicated interconnections in the nineteenth century
                    between the extension of mass 
                  
                     71 This process, often referred to as the feminization of teaching,
                            has been the focus of much study. For example, see Kaestle, Pillars of the

                    development of the wage-labor system.72 Following the advent of public schooling
                    in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , teachers, too, became an integral part of the emerging market economy. The number of
                    teachers, students, and schools increased rapidly, and the nature of the family relations that
                    existed within the educational labor force changed. Family roles no longer served as a sorting
                    mechanism for the educational work force; family members no longer worked in schools as family
                    members but as individuals. When brothers and sisters, fathers and daughters, and sisters taught in
                    the public school system, they were hired as individuals to teach a specific grade or grades or, at
                    the high school level, specific subjects. Because young, single women were cheapest to hire and,
                    some theorists suggest, because they had the least power within the family hierarchy and were, thus,
                    easily accommodated 
                  
                     72 This thesis is clearly stated in Theobald and Selleck, Family, School, and State in Australian History.

                within the new hierarchical power relationships at work, they gradually became the most
                    frequently hired. The result was an expanded, inexpensive educational labor force.73
            
            There was great diversity among the teachers in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     during the first half of the nineteenth century—in their abilities and
                    training, in their working conditions and pay, in the curriculum they taught, and in the type of
                    discipline they practiced. In spite of this diversity, or possibly because of it, the schools in
                    which they taught were unable to endure. As the state expanded its responsibilities to include
                    education, "teaching" was redefined. Teachers received wages for their labor, were
                    required to meet specific standards of training and performance, and were licensed by the state.
                    Career paths changed in line with broader economic developments. No longer was teaching considered
                    an apprenticeship for men's careers in law, medicine, business, or religion. General education in
                    academies or seminaries was no longer accepted as a sufficient "apprenticeship"

                     teachers.74 New methods of finance and
                    organization and new ideologies set the stage for the expansion of education, for strict divisions
                    between public, private, and religious education, and for the profession of teaching as it developed
                    in the twentieth century.
            Current discussions about the future of public education in Indiana and the 
                        United States
                     suggest that the concept of "public," which expanded with the coming
                    of state-supported schools in the nineteenth century, may be contracting because of efforts to
                    privatize public schools. Research concerning the effects of such a change has focused on students,
                    parents, curriculum, and financial resources. As a look at the evolution of the teaching profession
                    in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     indicates, an examination of the impact of changing conceptions of
                    "public" and "private" on teachers themselves might also be
                    beneficial. Since further evolution of the educational profession may again be in the offing, Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's teachers in the mid-nineteenth century may still have much to teach.
            
               
                  74 Because of labor shortages, an increased division of labor as a result
                        of industrialization, and the evolution of the wage-labor system, apprenticeship forms of
                        training had been breaking down in the 
                            United States
                         from colonial times on. At the same time new forms of training in professional

            Malinda Clark Slawson Pugh
            David L. Kimbrough∗
            
            On May 18, 1852, Malinda Clark Slawson Pugh of 
                        Indianapolis
                     gave birth to a son, Isaac Clark Pugh. By September Malinda was dead as a result of
                    complications associated with the delivery. Isaac Pugh, Malinda's husband at the time of her death,
                    informed his wife's former mother-in-law and father-in-law, Simeon and Martha Slawson, that Malinda
                    had died from the consequences of a "spongy fungus substance growing in the womb."
                    Doctors had taken out the substance, caused by failure to remove part of the placenta after the
                    childbirth, but it had grown back, resulting in Malinda's death.1
            
            Malinda had married Isaac Pugh on July 23, 1851, following the death of her first husband, Delanson
                    Slawson, six years earlier. After Delanson's death Malinda had taken care of her children and tended
                    the family farm alone. At the time of her marriage to Pugh, Malinda was in her forties and was
                    "beaten down" from hard work and debt. Pugh was fifteen years her senior and held
                    "20,000 in property and had one of the best farms in 
                        Marion County
                    ."2
            
            Regardless of Malinda's liberation from the responsibilities of her own farm, she was too worn out to
                    have additional children with Pugh. Large families were common on the frontier, however, and many
                    women gave birth almost annually during their childbearing years. "Procreation was highly
                    encouraged… both to aid population growth and provide future laborers for the family farm
                    or other business." According to historian Glenda Riley's "conservative
                    estimate," the average family on the frontier had ten children, and these high fertility
                    rates contributed to a lax or "matter-of-fact attitude

                    feared by nineteenth century women as the 'childbed fevers.'"4
            
            The high mortality rate resulting from childbirth and other diseases dispels many romantic notions of
                    the frontier. In her works Treatise on Domestic Economy (1841) and Letters to the People on Health and Happiness (1856) Catherine Beecher claimed that she
                    had "repeatedly heard mothers say, that they had wept tears of bitterness over their infant
                    daughters, at the thought of sufferings which they were destined to undergo; while they cherished
                    the decided wish, that these daughters should never marry."5 Cholera,
                    influenza, measles, "the fever," and other illnesses also caused many deaths.
                    During the 1840s Beecher "collected evidence that women were more often ill than well, and
                    that chronic disabilities were widespread among the female population."6 Malinda Pugh's correspondence with her family corroborates Beecher's statements and provides
                    a further glimpse into the hardships that women suffered in frontier America.7
            
            Malinda was a religious woman, the daughter of a blind Regular Baptist preacher, John Clark, from
                    Bennington, 
                        Vermont
                    .8 During the early 1820s the Clarks had moved to 
                        Switzerland County
                    , Indiana.9 No reason is given for the move other than that Clark
                    considered many of his neighbors in 
                        Vermont
                     to be heathens. Upon their arrival in 
                        Switzerland County
                    , the Clarks found various religious groups already well established. In fact, the
                    county was a hotbed of religious activity. Methodist circuit rider, Allen Wiley, had preached there
                    in 1814 and had delivered a funeral sermon in 
                        Vevay
                    , the county

                     8 John Clark, Malinda's father, was born December 14,1769, and died
                            October 1, 1832. Although the exact date of the wedding is unknown, he and Elizabeth
                            (Betsey) Edgecomb, also of 
                                Vermont
                            , were married during the 1790s. Clark was blind as a result of an illness
                            during his youth. It was later written of him that "after being introduced to a
                            person and conversing with him a short time—he [Clark] would recollect that
                            person and call him by name so soon as he heard his voice, a long while, yes two or three
                            years after his first conversation with him—he had a son (

                     9 In 1823 Lewis A. Clark, Malinda's brother, purchased one hundred
                            acres near Bennington, Indiana. It is likely that the Clarks founded the town of Bennington
                            and named it after Bennington, 
                                Vermont
                            .
               
                     seat, two years later. Wiley and fellow itinerant Russel Bigelow
                    had also organized a Methodist church in 
                        Vevay
                     in 1816.10 Lorenzo Dow, considered one of the greatest Methodist
                    clergymen, preached in 
                        Vevay
                     in 1814 or 1815 and again around 1817.11 Dr. James Welsh was one of
                    the first Presbyterians to preach in the county, and Regular Baptist ministers John Graham and
                    Mordecai Jackson, along with Malinda Clark's father, preached in various schoolhouses throughout the
                        area.12 Other denominations soon followed.
            Methodists dominated the Bennington area of 
                        Switzerland County
                     where the Clarks resided. Malinda's future father-in-law, Simeon Slawson, made his
                    house available to the Methodists for worship. In fact, itinerant ministers flocked to the Slawsons'
                    home. Described as a "leader among the Methodists, a man of some means, and his wife a good
                    cook," Slawson also had "two or three good looking girls and plenty of
                    chickens," all of which made his home a paradise for the traveling preachers. Indeed, the
                    Reverends Joseph Tarkington and John Winchester, both well known throughout the state, married into
                    the Slawson family.13 Allen Wiley also lived in the area.14
            
            Religious gatherings provided social intercourse on the frontier, and they were often
                    interdenominational. Courtships were frequently conducted at church meetings as there were few other
                    places where young adults could meet. The Clark family often attended the Methodist meetings at the
                    Slawsons'. During one such gathering around 1830, Malinda and the Slawsons' son Delanson, who had
                    known each other from childhood, decided to marry.15 After their wedding on May
                    10, 1832, they remained in 
                        Switzerland County
                     for five years as farmers. The couple had a child, John C, in 1833, but the infant died
                    on April 12, 1834. Following John's death, Malinda and Delanson agreed to raise a baby boy, Albert,
                    whose parents had died of "the fever."16

                        They did not tell the boy that he was not their natural child. John Tarkington [John Steventon,

            Malinda and Delanson moved to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1837 after the Slawsons had given their son a quarter section of land, known as the
                    "Sugar Flats," located four miles north of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . John Tark-ington, Delanson's nephew, described his uncle as "tall and strong,
                    the match of any two men at the clearings and barn-raisings." Delanson cleared one-fourth
                    of his land, cutting down the large maple, elm, and walnut trees. He built a "substantial
                    farm-house and barn, while a thrifty orchard soon bore abundant fruitage for the cider mill and
                        cellar."17
            
            Malinda Slawson was certainly not the "Mary Vial Holyoke" or "pretty
                    gentlewoman" described in Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's classic work Good
                        Wives.
               18 Malinda had little time for sipping tea or admiring fine
                    silver. In addition to her domestic duties she worked beside her husband clearing land and building
                    her home. A married woman on the Indiana frontier, as Ulrich pictured New 
                        England
                     women at a similar period in their lives, was simultaneously "a housewife, a
                    deputy husband, a consort, a mother, a mistress, a neighbor, and a Christian."19 Hoosier wives could also be compared to Horace Kephart's view of Appalachian
                    women at the beginning of the twentieth century: "The mountain farmer's wife is not only a
                    household drudge but a field hand as well. She helps to plant, hoes corn, gathers fodder, sometimes
                    even plows or splits rails. It is the commonest of sights for a woman to be awkwardly hacking up
                    firewood with a dull axe."20 As was true in eighteenth-century New 
                        England
                    , social organization in early nineteenth-century Indiana linked "economic
                    responsibilities to family responsibilities."21 Malinda's duties
                    included long back-breaking hours hoeing, thinning, and harvesting a "kitchen
                    garden" or "truck patch," which was the primary source of food for the
                    family.
            Following the Slawsons' agreement to raise Albert, Malinda gave birth to five additional children
                    between 1834 and 1845.22 In frontier Indiana and elsewhere pregnancies generally
                    did not interrupt work cycles; consequently, Malinda, while pregnant, continued to help her husband
                    build fences and feed livestock and to perform other required duties.
            When the Slawsons arrived in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the small town was an unhealthy area, and the family was constantly plagued by
                    illness. On April 30, 1839, Delanson wrote to his mother and father that

                    some medicine from a doctor. He claimed that two or three doses would break the chills. On November
                    16, 1840, he disclosed that he was sick and had not been able to work since August 10. A week before
                    the letter was written, Malinda had given birth to a baby that they named John. One month later
                    Delanson reported that Malinda was ill with the "chills" and that the baby had a
                    cold. When Malinda was sick, Delanson was forced to do the milking and cooking. In 1843 measles
                    struck, and winter fever was a problem.23
            
            As the Slawsons had discovered, diseases were a constant threat on the central Indiana frontier.
                    Harrison Burns stated that in the "wilds of 
                        Tipton County
                    " there was
            
                    a great deal of malaria; nearly every one in the county had the "ague." There
                        were not enough well people in the town [Sharpsville] to wait on the sick, and the only
                        physician in the place lay in his bed and measured out medicine, mostly quinine, to persons who
                        were able to come for it. I had never been sick, and did not have the regular fever and ague,
                        but my system became full of malaria and I had a spell of fever which confined me to my bed and
                        finally developed what is called the "dumb ague."24
               
                
            Although much of Delanson's correspondence with his mother and father dealt with illness, many of his
                    letters were filled with news about his farming activities. In one letter he wrote that he had
                    logged five acres during the day and that he had ten acres fenced, had bought an old peacock plow
                    for six dollars, and had thirty acres in corn, four in oats, and sixteen pigs a week old. Corn, he
                    said, sold for only twenty cents a bushel in the summer of 1840. He had procured ten barrels of salt
                    from 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     in November of 1840 and had sent a worker, "Uriah," to 
                        Madison
                     in December of that year "with a drove of about 1,000 hogs." He added
                    that it took sixteen to eighteen days to complete such a task. Delanson boasted that he and Uriah
                    could "shuck sixty-five bushels of corn in a day and put it in a crib." He also
                    commented on economic hardships in other areas of Indiana. In January, 1845, people from adjacent 
                        Boone
                     and 
                        Hamilton
                     counties were suffering a severe corn shortage. Delanson hired a 
                        Hamilton county
                     man, Issac Richards, and paid him seventeen bushels of corn to do ten days farm
                        work.25
            
            The Slawsons were almost self-sufficient. Malinda made their clothing, preserved foodstuffs, and
                    helped Delanson butcher and cure meat that was stored for the winter. Historian Elizabeth Jameson
                    claims that families such as the Slawsons were an "interdependent economic unit."
                    Nevertheless, "work was divided as in most cultures, along gender lines. Men plowed,
                    planted, and cared for the sheep,

                     horses, and pigs. Women raised and processed vegetables, kept
                    the dairy and the poultry, made clothing, cared for the sick, and did housework." Alice
                    Kessler-Harris notes, however, that the division of labor was not clearly defined. Although women
                    did the bulk of "internal domestic chores," husbands often did spinning and
                    weaving when farm work was complete, and "wives routinely developed competency in their
                    husbands' businesses."26
            
            Malinda often scribbled a few lines in her husband's letters to the Slawsons. She told of milking
                    cows or making linen and reported that she had made "straw hats for the boys and sold 6 1/2 pounds of butter a week." The children were attending school, she
                    wrote, and daughter Martha Jane was "very mischievous." In March of 1843 she
                    commented, Flavins "wishes to inform you that he has shed two of his teeth." The
                    Slawsons told their parents of friends from 
                        Switzerland County
                     who had moved near them in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and noted that some of Allen Wiley's family lived in the vicinity. Occasionally Malinda
                    and Delanson mentioned other interesting events. In August, 1845, for example, Delanson related:
                    "court is now in session… 3 or 4 convicts for lower house for steeling and Negro
                        killing."27
            
            Much of Delanson and Malinda's correspondence reflects their loneliness. They complained when they
                    did not receive mail from family members. Malinda was sometimes critical of the Tarkingtons and her
                    brother Lewis for not writing. In March of 1842 she reported that she had not heard from the
                    Tarkingtons "since their babe was three weeks old." Evidently her complaints were
                    effective. In July she wrote that she had received a letter and that "they are all
                        well."28 Delanson and Malinda generally visited 
                        Switzerland County
                     in the fall of the year after the crops had been harvested, and they constantly begged
                    Simeon and Martha to visit them at their farm near 
                        Indianapolis
                    . In one letter Delanson told his father "to come out and see if he was doing
                    things right." In another he offered to serve his parents "a fat shote,"
                    sweet potatoes, and corn dodgers if they would come. In July, 1843, he again pleaded with his mother
                    to visit and stated, "a person out of debt could."29

            Delanson and Malinda often wrote of religious matters in their letters.30 In 1840
                    they reported that there was "preaching" at their home "every 2
                    weeks." The Slawsons lived on the 
                        Noblesville
                     circuit, and the two circuit riders who visited them were named Berry and Smith. In
                    another letter Malinda mentioned a camp meeting that was to commence "in three
                        weeks."31 The Slawsons found comfort in their religion when
                    disaster struck. On February 2, 1841, Delanson informed his parents that his daughter Martha Jane
                    had died of the "scarlot fever." Flavins was the first to become ill with the
                    disease, but he had escaped death. Martha Jane was not so fortunate. Delanson reported that
                    "Br. Crawford preached her funeral sermon then she was taken to her cold and silent
                    grave." Malinda expressed much guilt over the death. She felt that she was being
                    "severely chastened of the Lord for my unfaithfulness to him." The day before
                    Martha Jane became ill, Malinda wrote, the child had gotten her hymn book and "sit in my
                    chair and sing with all her infant simplicity my prayer to God."32
            
            Family correspondence reveals that the Slawsons viewed a crippling injury or death as a
                    "warning for all to prepare for death."33 Their religious
                    beliefs comforted and helped them through such tragedy. Malinda's mother-in-law, Martha, had dealt
                    with death and grief. Between December 27, 1830, and January 30, 1832, she lost five of her children
                    to typhoid.34 Martha had also lost a child in 1814 and wrote that she had
                    "resign [ed] its Little Soul into the arms of God." In spite of Martha's pain, she
                    felt that it was sinful to grieve too much. She wrote to family members John and Rhoda Slawson,
                    "But Oh that we may consider our afflicktions aright and not ofend the lord by over
                    mourning for the Dead."35
            
            Studies of early nineteenth-century family life suggest that Calvinist stoicism, like Martha's, or
                    other forms of mourning did not completely suppress grief over the loss of a loved one, especially a
                        child.36 Although religion provided solace for frontier families, death was
                    not taken lightly. One Iowa family, for example, "kept their dead child's miniature rocking
                    chair in the living room of their home for forty years after her demise."37 And historian Ann Douglas depicts women 
                  
                     30 Malinda had joined the Methodist church after marrying Delanson and
                            moving to

            As a boy, John Tarkington spent his summers "during every long school-vacation" at
                    his Uncle Delanson's farm. John enjoyed visiting his uncle and playing with Albert since the boys
                    were near the same age. During the summers the two "wrestled with equal strength, had gone
                    paw-pawing, had harvested, had joyed in old-time country dances, frolicked in our work in the fields
                    and gone fishing in White River."39 John also
                    remembered an old song that he had learned there:
            
                    For to plow, for to sow,
                    For to reap, for to mow,
                    For to be a farmer's boy.40
               
                
            In September, 1845, Delanson died, at least in part because he had overworked himself doing the
                    "Fall-plowing" and "Fall wheat-sowing."41 He
                    was buried beside his daughter Martha Jane. Malin-da was devastated and left with five children. On
                    the evening of Delanson's death Tarkington reported that the family "met as usual, in the
                    family-room, and by the candlelight on the stand, the mother—(Malinda, honey sweet, as
                    was her name)," read the Twenty-third Psalm.
            Then, with all the family kneeling, she recited the Lord's Prayer. Tarkington observed: "an
                    awaiting silence followed, into which alone, slowly and falteringly, crept a low, tear-dropped
                        'Amen.'"42
            
            At Delanson's death Malinda told thirteen-year-old Albert that he was not her natural child.
                    Tarkington reported that Albert was alarmed: "He looked around upon his brothers and
                    sisters of a moment ago, and they were not. He gazed open-mouthed and big-eyed upon his dying father
                    and heard the stumbling words of his mother as they fell sobbing between tears; and father and
                    mother had vanished." After a period of time one of Albert's relatives came to Indiana and
                    took the boy back to 
                  Memphis, Tennessee
               .43
            
            Malinda was faced with many hardships after Delanson's death. She was forced to take on her husband's
                    duties as well as continuing with her own domestic responsibilities. Although church members would
                    sometimes assist needy members of their congregations, towns and counties generally "had no
                    interest in supporting all women and children whose husbands or fathers had died or
                        deserted."44 Malinda was no exception. Along with backbreaking work
                    and personal illness, she found herself in debt following her husband's death

                     41 Overwork was Delanson's constant companion. In a letter to his
                            parents in May, 1843, for example, he recorded that he had planted 10 1/2 acres of corn in
                            five days while doing many other tasks.

                     and often complained that her children were sick. In a letter to
                    Simeon and Martha Slawson, she stated that she owed her brother-in-law, Joseph Tarkington, 150
                    dollars. In order to pay the debt she sold Delanson's carriage and harness. In the same letter
                    Malinda relayed that she had not given up her religious convictions and added, "the lord
                    will provide."45
            
            In subsequent letters to the Slawsons, Malinda wrote that she had lost children to death and that her
                    father had perished. She had done the planting, harvesting, and butchering; made apple and pumpkin
                    butter; grown a truck patch; assisted in digging a well; and bought her dead husband a four-foot
                    tombstone with scriptures engraved on it. Malinda also taught Sabbath school and walked two miles to
                    church to hear ministers preach on such texts as "acknowledge God in all thy ways and He
                    shall direct thy steps."46 A "cold spell" in the
                    spring of 1849 killed her fruit crop. There was the constant threat of disease. Cholera was
                    "not yet in 
                        Indianapolis
                    " in midsummer, 1849, she wrote, "but is in every
                        direction."47
            
            Other than cutting wood, Malinda performed every farm task that Delanson had previously done,
                    generally without the help of her eldest son, Flavins. Malinda probably did not require Flavins to
                    work very hard. Tarkington commented that "the boy was bright of wit, strong of muscle and
                    affectionate. If any difference was ever shown in the regard of the farmer and his wife for the
                    children it was in favor of that boy." In the spring of 1848 Flavins went to live with the
                    Slawsons on their farm in 
                        Switzerland County
                    . Malinda requested that his grandparents "send him to school" and
                    make him plow and plant. She wanted him to attend church and directed Flavins to "keep the
                    Sabbath… read the Bible… and write."48
            
            Flavins returned home in the fall of 1849 and planted four acres of wheat.49 He
                    did not remain long. By January, 1850, he was living with his Aunt Maluda and the Reverend John
                    Winchester near 
                        Greensburg
                    . Residing with the Winchesters was no vacation. Flavins was required to cut all the
                    wood used for cooking and heating and to feed the livestock. All the Slawson women believed in
                    education. Maluda, self-educated and creative, was no exception. She required her nephew to
                    "get two pages of philosophy every night." In 1851 Flavins enrolled in Indiana
                    Asbury at 
                        Greencastle
                    . In addition to her other burdens, Malinda paid his tuition.50
            
            Malinda remained active in church and community affairs. She complained to the Slawsons that the
                    Methodists needed a church.

                     She held Methodist class meetings in her home; church was
                    conducted in an old schoolhouse. She assisted in getting subscriptions for a new church, raising 186
                    dollars from other people and donating 30 dollars of her own money in spite of her financial
                    difficulties. Malinda sold horses and other livestock simply "to get by."51
            
            In July, 1851, Malinda decided to marry Pugh. Feeling obligated to the Slawsons, she asked for their
                    permission. She had kept in close contact with her husband's parents because her own were dead.52 Malinda stated that she had known Pugh many years and had discussed the
                    marriage with friends. She emphasized that she had suffered many hardships since Delanson's
                        death.53 The Slawsons agreed to the marriage.
            Malinda left her farm and moved to Pugh's estate. Although her financial difficulties were relieved,
                    she continued to be plagued by illness. To compound her health problems, she became pregnant in
                    September. Malinda and Pugh visited the Slawsons in 
                        Switzerland County
                     in late 1851. After their return on November 12, Malin-da's daughter Martha D. died of
                    scarlet fever—as had Martha Jane earlier—and was buried near her father.54
            
            Grief over the death of her daughter along with complications associated with the birth of her son
                    resulted in Malinda's death. "Unfortunately, gynecology was an area of medical practice
                    shrouded in ignorance, superstition, and nineteenth century standards of'modesty.' Variously
                    referred to as female ailments, complaints, weakness, diseases, difficulties, and problems, the
                    whole matter was seen as part of woman's lot in life."56 The demands of
                    the frontier killed Malinda as it had Delanson. Many women perished under the same conditions.
            Pugh buried Malinda beside her first husband. He wrote the Slawsons that he had given her clothes to
                    a Mrs. Samuel Walker, who was moving to 
                        Iowa
                    .56 Malinda's children went to 
                        Switzerland County
                     to live with their grandparents. Life on the frontier moved on.
            History has not dealt kindly with women like Malinda Clark. Their efforts and accomplishments have
                    been overlooked, their place on the frontier rarely recognized. Yet their contributions to history,
                    if not heroic, were undeniably great. Malinda Clark Slawson Pugh deserves to be remembered.

                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, Got Lost in the Census: 1850 as a Demographic Dilemma
            George T. Blakey∗
            
            Historians and demographers have been deeply indebted to the 1850 federal census, but 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, has resented that seventh counting of the nation's population with equally
                    deep emotions. Never had the country learned so much about itself since the decennial census began
                    in 1790. For the first time the published results revealed data about religious congregations, farm
                    acreage and value, and the geographical origins and migrations of Americans.1
                    Despite this rich new information that added flesh and blood to the dry bones of previous
                    headcounts, citizens of 
                        Richmond
                     were dismayed to learn that their community had lost 30 percent of its population and
                    had fallen from the ranks of the state's leading cities. The city had recently shown every sign of
                    health, prosperity, and growth, yet the federal tabulations were official and have been cited ever
                    since. 
                        Richmond
                     had mysteriously shrunk—and then miraculously rebounded by almost 500
                    percent in the next census of 1860. Where had all the people gone and why? And how had the city
                    recovered so rapidly within a decade? Answers then lacking to explain this bust and boom phenomenon
                    are now available.
            Before the watershed census of 1850 Hoosiers had appeared in only three federal enumerations because
                    Indiana had become a state only in 1816. Prior to statehood demographic data for Indiana are sketchy
                    and anecdotal, but the three subsequent census reports chart a steady, predictable growth. Migrants
                    from the southern and east-em parts of the 
                        United States
                     moved into the southern and eastern parts of Indiana and gradually moved north and
                    west. First the Ohio River valley communities developed, then the central
                    flatlands; and finally the northern swamps and dunes gave way to farms and industry. The National
                    Road cut across the state's midsection in the 1830s, bringing in easterners and commerce. The canal
                    mania of the late 1830s and 1840s attracted new people and enterprises along the water routes.
                    German and Irish immigrants began to make their presence felt simultaneously with the federal
                    removal of the last

                     Indian tribes. From a population of 147,000 in 1820 to 685,000
                    in 1840, Indiana rose from the eighteenth largest state to the tenth. The rapid development of
                    railroad transportation in the 1840s and 1850s accelerated this trend.2
            
            Early settlement in Indiana was predominantly rural. Although towns began to develop by the
                    mid-nineteenth century, they did not grow at the same pace as the rest of the state. Small by
                    today's standards, these rising centers of transportation, commerce, and industry nonetheless gave
                    focus and structure to Hoosier life. Paralleling settlement in the state, towns and villages
                    developed first in southern Indiana, then in central and northern areas. In the 1830 census no
                    cities in Indiana qualified as urban (defined as incorporated places with at least 2,500 residents),
                    but several were beginning to show promise of population growth. Both 
                        Madison
                     and New 
                        Albany
                     on the Ohio River had close to 2,000 inhabitants and profited from
                    the flourishing river traffic. 
                        Vincennes
                     at nearly 1,500 benefited from its heritage as a commercial and political capital on
                    the lower Wabash River under French, English, and territorial rule. The new
                    state capital of 
                        Indianapolis
                     had just over 1,000 people, mainly because of its political status.3 One decade later, in 1840, considerable urbanization had occurred. New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Madison
                     had doubled in size, and 
                        Indianapolis
                    , assisted by its position astraddle the booming National Road, had crossed the line
                    into urbanity at 2,600. Although 
                        Vincennes
                     had stalled in the southwest, 
                        Richmond
                     was rising fast in the east with a population of 2,070.4
            
            Situated on the east fork of the Whitewater River near the 
                        Ohio
                     state border, 
                        Richmond
                     was settled in 1806 by 
                        North Carolina
                     Quakers who sought a new life away from slavery. Rich soil and a good agricultural
                    climate soon attracted more settlers to the community. Incorporated in 1818, the town grew slowly
                    until the National Road inched its way westward from 
                        Ohio
                     toward 
                        Illinois
                    . Surveyed through 
                        Richmond
                     in 1827, with construction beginning shortly thereafter, this east-to-west American
                    thoroughfare transformed the city. When the first bridge across the formidable limestone gorge of
                    the Whitewater River was completed in 1834, traffic moved unimpeded, carrying finished goods from
                    the East and raw materials from the West. In 1836 a new local newspaper, The
                    Palladium, commented editorially on this increased traffic: "one hundred 'moving'
                    wagons have passed through this town daily… and still they come—the
                    never-ending tide rolls on!"5 Many of the migrants and construction
                    crews decided to stay, and by the time of the 1840 census 2,070 people called this almosturban

                    published two newspapers. And it was the fastest growing town in the state's most populous county.
                    In 1840 it received a charter as a city and elected its first mayor.6
            
            John Sailor, the newly elected mayor of 
                        Richmond
                     in 1840, presided for the next twelve years over a city whose economic and religious
                    life appeared to be flourishing. Although official demographic data would not be available to verify
                    this growth until the next federal census in 1850, a representative sampling of new activity during
                    the 1840s charts 
                        Richmond
                    's increasing prosperity. The Spring Foundry marketed its first threshing machine in
                    1841 and expanded rapidly during the decade; the Robinson machine works opened near the river in
                    1842 as did Armstrong Grimes's new City Hotel; John Boswell introduced 
                        Richmond
                    's first photography shop in 1844; and 
                        Benton
                     and Fletcher's Hardware store began operations in 1846. Ralph Paige started a new dry
                    goods store in 1847, and Henry Rosa opened his bottling and vinegar works the following year.7 Religious growth paralleled economic development in the city during this
                    decade. Five new churches were organized, and four others erected buildings of worship. Quakers
                    opened Friends Boarding School in 1847 and soon changed its mission and name to Earlham College.8
            
            During the 1840s 
                        Richmond
                     was also reaching out to other communities with new transportation and communications
                    networks. The city's leaders had caught Indiana's canal fever. Convinced that a link to the
                    Whitewater Canal at 
                        Brookville
                     would bring the traffic and profits of Ohio River business to 
                        Richmond
                    , they proposed a thirty-four-mile project of locks, dams, and ditches estimated to cost
                    approximately $500,000. After $45,000 had been spent, a flood in 1847
                    devastated the project, and it was abandoned.9 More prosaic but more successful
                    were the three highway projects begun or completed in the 1840s. The road to 
                        Williamsburg
                     to the northwest, the turnpike to 
                        Boston
                     in the south, and the

                        Newport

                        Richmond
                     was expanding its reputation as a commercial hub. And in April, 1848, the first

               , and ultimately to the nation.10
            
            Increased property values and unofficial population surveys confirmed that 
                        Richmond
                     was continuing to boom in the 1840s. Assessed property values reveal an
                    upward—albeit erratic—trend from 1840 to 1850. Official accounts show
                    collective evaluations more than doubling, from $215,000 in 1840 to $436,000 a
                    decade later.11 In 1848 Samuel Pierce, a local merchant, conducted his own
                    population count of the city. A former member of the city council and at the time city collector,
                    Pierce was in a position to understand population changes. His findings revealed that 
                        Richmond
                     had 2,531 people, an increase of 500 since the last federal census and enough to make 
                        Richmond
                     officially an urban center for the first time.12 This figure was
                    personal and unofficial, but it confirmed what most citizens of 
                        Richmond
                     believed about the city's progress.
            The 1850 census revealed much about Indiana that was expected. The Hoosier state had continued to
                    grow—to a population of 980,000—and had risen from the nation's tenth largest
                    to seventh.13 The Miami and Potawatomi tribes had been relocated to the west;
                    thus, Native Americans did not register in the headcount, not even those few who had contracted with
                    the government to remain in the Hoosier state. Immigrants from 
                        Germany
                     had become the largest non-native group in the state with 29,000 tallied.14
                    
                        Richmond
                     could testify to the importance of this influx because of its recently completed St.
                    Andrew's Catholic and St. John's Lutheran churches, both of which served new German families.
                    African Americans, designated as "free colored," totaled 11,000, and it appeared
                    that 
                        Wayne County
                     had the largest number of any county in the state with 1,000.15
                    This racial distribution could easily have been predicted. Quakers in the upper Whitewater valley
                    were active in the Underground Railroad, and some of the runaway slaves remained in 
                        Wayne County
                     because of its hospitable atmosphere. Levi Coffin's work with fugitive slaves in 
                        Wayne County
                     was almost legendary by this time; and Bishop William Paul Quinn, a spiritual Johnny
                    Appleseed, had planted several African Methodist Episcopal churches around the Midwest, 
                        Richmond
                    's as early as 1836.
            But the 1850 census surprised 
                        Richmond
                     because its figures refuted the apparent growth and progress of the preceding decade.

                     The city, with an official population of 1,443, had not only
                    failed to maintain its position as one of the state's largest towns but it had also lost
                    approximately 600 people or roughly 30 percent of its population since the last census. In light of
                    this reported decline it seemed strange that 
                        Wayne County
                     had continued to grow. With a population listed at 25,000, it was still the most
                    populous county in the state, and none of the other towns in the county could compete with 
                        Richmond
                     as a retail, banking, or industrial center. The second largest town, 
                        Cambridge City
                    , had only 1,200 people. In contrast to 
                        Richmond
                    's apparent decline, other Indiana cities had continued to grow. New
                            
                  Albany, Madison
               , and 
                        Indianapolis
                     had each reached approximately 8,000, and new additions to the official urban category
                    were 
                        Lafayette
                    , Fort 
                  Wayne, Terre
                            Haute
               , and 
                        Evansville
                    , which ranged from 6,000 to 3,000 in the order listed.16
            
            The residents of 
                        Richmond
                     were more perplexed than outraged at the 1850 census figures. The unofficial results of
                    the 
                        Wayne County
                     part of the census appeared in area newspapers as early as September, 1850, and
                    revealed that 
                        Richmond
                    's population was just above 2,600,17 a figure that corresponded to
                    Samuel Pierce's census of 1848. By the time the official, but unbelievable, figure of 1,443 appeared
                    in 1853, another census—this one commissioned by the state and conducted by the
                    townships—contradicted the official count. The 1853 state/township figure for 
                        Richmond
                     was 3,800 and indicated that the city had not declined since 1840 but had, in fact,
                    grown rapidly. The discrepancies in the unofficial, the official, and the state/township figures
                    were difficult to understand. Federal census officials cited the state/township numbers in their Compendium to the seventh census, published in 1854, but did not repeat them in
                    subsequent publications.18 The official count of 
                        Richmond
                    's population in 1850 remained at 1,443 regardless of its questionable validity. It has
                    continued to be cited and to mislead ever since.
            Contemporary chroniclers of 
                        Richmond
                    's past generally chose to cite the unofficial population statistics or, a bit later, to
                    focus on the 1860 census, which showed 
                        Richmond
                     making a miraculous rebound with a new population of 6,600. The first published history

                     appeared in 1857 in the form of a city directory and sixty-three-page historical sketch
                    of the city's founding and growth. Dr. John Plummer, a local physician, compiled and published the
                    book, and researchers have since regarded it as an accurate and indispensable source. Plummer cited
                    Pierce's census of 1848, which listed the population as 2,531, and declared that it had been
                    "carefully taken." He then cited the 1853 state/township population of 3,800 as

                            for the 1853 state/township enumeration have proven fruitless.
               
                     proof of the continued growth of his city.19
                    Subsequent city and county directories and gazetteers also chose to omit the troublesome official
                    count from 1850 and cite the more positive statistics instead.20 Following the
                    release of the 1860 federal census data, the 
                        Richmond
                    
                    Palladium boasted about the city's ascension to 6,600 people, which, by its
                    reckoning, made 
                        Richmond
                     the fourth fastest-growing city in the nation.21
                    
                        Wayne County
                    's first comprehensive history appeared in 1872, and its author, Andrew Young, cited the
                    official figures for both 1850 and 1860 with no rebuttal or interpretation, allowing the raw data to
                    tell their own dramatic story of bust and boom.22 The miraculous recovery in
                    1860 was obviously more important than the inexplicable and temporary decline in 1850.
            Most twentieth-century historians of Indiana who have discussed the 1850 census have paid more
                    attention to the new data that became available than to 
                        Richmond
                    's dilemma. Logan Esarey was one of the first scholars to analyze Hoosier demographic
                    data, and he briefly described the growth of 
                        Richmond
                    . While he cited the 1850 census count of 1,443 and the 1860 tally of 6,600, he did not
                    speculate about the decline and recovery phenomenon.23 A generation later John
                    D. Barnhart and Donald F. Carmony did considerable analysis of urban growth in Indiana, using both
                    newspaper accounts and census data to achieve some sense of accuracy for the early years. They
                    mentioned 
                        Richmond
                     as one of the leading cities in 1840, noted its plummet in 1850, and cited its 1860
                    rebound; but they offered no explanation for this anomaly.24 Demographic
                    historian Stephen S. Visher offered information from the 1850 census that alluded to why 
                        Richmond
                     might have declined in the 1840s. New data on migration patterns revealed that Hoosiers
                    had trekked west in sizeable numbers during the decade; for example, 25,000 had relocated to 
                        Illinois
                     and 20,000 to 
                        Iowa
                    .25 There is no way of knowing, however, how many of those had left 
                        Richmond
                     in the 1840s. In the 1960s Emma Lou Thornbrough's study of the state during the Civil
                    War era noted 
                        Richmond
                    's rapid expansion between 1850 and 1860. She discussed this in relation to the
                    attendant railroad boom but did not pursue the earlier population decline.26

                     the 1850 census and the rise of urbanization, but neither probed 
                        Richmond
                    's unusual situation.27
            
            Only two historians have specifically acknowledged 
                        Richmond
                    's dilemma and questioned the validity of the 1850 census. Both of these historians once
                    lived in 
                        Richmond
                    . Bernhard Knollenberg grew up in 
                        Wayne County
                    , became a librarian at Yale University, and spent several years researching and writing
                        Pioneer Sketches of the Upper Whitewater Valley, published in 1945. The
                    decline of the city's population did not make sense to Knollenberg. Although the 1853 state/township
                    correction afforded some consolation, it was not enough. Because his location in 
                        Connecticut
                     and government service during World War II prevented him from pursuing this topic to
                    his satisfaction, he concluded simply that the 1850 census figure was "presumably too
                    low" and went on to other things.28 In 1989 the Indiana Historical
                    Society published Indiana: A New Historical Guide, with extensive sketches of
                    leading Hoosier cities. The book's major author, Robert M. Taylor, Jr., lived briefly in 
                        Richmond
                    , and he probed the subject with more interest and acuity than is evident elsewhere.
                    Taylor found 
                        Richmond
                    's alleged decline in 1850 unacceptable but suggested several possible causes for it,
                    including a diminishing number of 
                        Quaker
                     migrants into the city, the deadly 1849 cholera epidemic, and the lure of the 1849 
                        California
                     gold rush. Ultimately, Taylor found his own explanations "doubtful"
                    and cited evidence of 
                        Richmond
                    's continued growth during the 1840s. For instance, the new business enterprises, church
                    construction, and highway expansion are all well documented. He left the situation thoroughly
                    questioned, but unresolved.29
            
            A careful review of the handwritten 1850 census schedules for 
                        Richmond
                     and 
                        Wayne County
                     provides a partial answer to this question, now more than a century old. Local census
                    marshals located and listed 2,604 residents of 
                        Richmond
                     in August and September of 1850,30 but federal census officials in 
                        Washington
                     somehow omitted 1,161 of them from the final tally. The official, printed total was
                    1,443. How did this happen? The 
                        Washington
                     officials probably found the 
                        Wayne County
                     returns a confusing collection of fragments and were unable to assemble the parts
                    completely and correctly. Assistant census marshals enumerated the county's townships separately in
                    the late summer of 1850. William Dalby and Theron Park were the two assistant marshals responsible
                    for collecting data for 
                        Wayne

                     begin.
            Dalby entered the names, approximately 42 per page, of residents from the southern one-half of 
                        Richmond
                     and 
                        Wayne
                     Township. He completed his list on page 335 with a total of 1,401 people for 
                        Richmond
                    , broken down into 387 families who lived in 386 dwellings. Then, for unexplained
                    reasons, the 
                        Richmond
                     tally is interrupted for 102 pages by entries for Center and Abington townships. Not
                    until page 437 do the 
                        Richmond
                     listings resume. At this point Park's entries for the northern one-half of 
                        Richmond
                     and 
                        Wayne
                     Township begin. From pages 437 to 500 Park entered approximately 42 names per page,
                    totaling 1,161 persons from 
                        Richmond
                    , who constituted 498 families living in the same number of dwellings. Again, and for no
                    stated reasons, 
                        Richmond
                     is interrupted for another 74 pages. The reader of the schedules must scan data on 
                        Franklin
                     and 
                        New Garden
                     townships. Not until page 574 does Park submit his final page of 42 additional names
                    for 
                        Richmond
                    .31 The total for the three 
                        Richmond
                     sections is 2,604, but the federal census officials apparently counted Dalby's list of
                    1,401 and Park's second list of 42 and arrived at the official total of 1,443. For whatever reason,
                    they missed or lost or chose not to count Park's first list containing the names of 1,161 people
                    from the northern side of 
                        Richmond
                    . Consequently, these names were omitted from the national count.
            The fragmented nature of the

                     schedules did present a confusing puzzle for official tabulators in 
                        Washington
                    . One can understand their confusion and sympathize with their situation. Pages were
                    handwritten, sometimes difficult to decipher. The fact that 
                        Richmond
                     was divided into three sections created a problem. On these schedules someone has
                    written notes which indicate that the 
                        Richmond
                     data were split and that the tally would continue on later pages. Whether this
                    handwritten cross-referencing was done at the time of the 1850 census or later by someone who
                    figured out the problem is impossible to determine. It is logical to assume that when the 1853
                    state/township numbers arrived and were printed in the Compendium, a compiler
                    might have double-checked the original schedules, assembled the pieces of the puzzle, and entered
                    the cross-reference notation. But this is only an assumption, and by then it was too late for the
                    missing 1,161 
                        Richmond
                     residents.
            Who were those missing 1,161? They lived on the northern side of town, and many were among 
                        Richmond
                    's most influential citizens. Those enumerated in

                    established downtown druggist Irvin Reed; the retired, but well-known tinsmith Solomon Dickinson;
                    Albert Blanchard, a local bank president, and Noah Leeds, the town telegrapher. The exclusion of
                    William Mason, a cabinetmaker from the British West Indies, and Henry Putthoff, an immigrant
                    papermaker from 
                        Germany
                    , caused 
                        Richmond
                     to appear less culturally heterogeneous than it was. Perhaps the most ironic omission
                    of all was the name of Samuel Pierce, merchant, former city councilman and city collector, and the
                         unofficial census taker whose 1848 headcount had been so
                        prescient.32 By failing to count these 1,161 residents, federal officials
                    eliminated 
                        Richmond
                     from the list of Indiana's leading cities. Not until the "miraculous"
                    recovery of 1860 would 
                        Richmond
                     resume its rightful place as an urban center.
            The fragmented 
                        Wayne County
                     census schedules from 1850 only partially explain the dramatic decline of 
                        Richmond
                     in the national seventh census. A simple mistake in counting—or not
                    counting— made 
                        Richmond
                     appear to have lost 600 people, or 30 percent of its population, since the previous
                    count. This jumbled compilation of names does not, however, account for the dramatic increase to
                    3,800 three years later according to the state/township survey. It could be that assistant marshals
                    Dalby and Park undercounted in 1850; after all, 2,600 represented only a small increase from 2,070
                    in 1840. Just possibly, Visher's allusions to Hoosiers moving west and Taylor's scenario about
                    disease and migrations are correct, and 
                        Richmond
                    's growth had indeed slowed in the 1840s.33 Another possibility is
                    that the estimate of 3,800 in 1853 was grossly inflated. Only one thing can be said with assurance:
                    a closer reading of the evidence proves that 
                        Richmond
                     did not decline during the decade of the 1840s while the rest of the state grew. It was
                    growing, too, but at an uncertain rate. When the railroad boom began for 
                        Richmond
                     in 1853, the city's population grew swiftly, and the 1860 count of 6,600 reveals a 
                        Richmond
                     whose star was rising as never before. The city had grown slowly on the banks of the
                    shallow Whitewater River, more rapidly along the bustling National Road; on parallel tracks of
                    steel, 
                        Richmond
                     accelerated at full speed.

                    index. $29.95.)
            Although Sherman Minton has been the subject of a number of doctoral dissertations, rather
                    surprisingly this is the first published account of his public life. Born and raised in hardscrabble
                    poverty in southern Indiana, Minton early on developed a passion for politics and found a political
                    hero when he witnessed the campaigns of William Jennings Bryan. Minton received his law degree from
                    Indiana University and a master's degree in law from Yale. He served in the army during World War I.
                    After two unsuccessful efforts to run for Congress, Minton, a rabid New Deal supporter, emerged from
                    the rough-and-tumble of Hoosier politics with a Senate seat in 1934. Fortuitously, his desk in the
                    Senate was next to another freshman senator, Harry S. Truman.
            An ardent supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt's unpopular "court packing" plan and a
                    defender of the even less popular Burke-Wadsworth Selective Service Act of 1940, Minton was defeated
                    for reelection. Roosevelt appointed him to the Seventh Court of Appeals in 1941, and his friend,
                    Truman, named him to the Supreme Court in 1949. He retired from the latter position in 1956 because
                    of ill health. He died in 1965.
            This splendidly researched work is not simply a very well written account of Minton's career, it is
                    also a careful, if slightly repetitious, analysis of Minton's thinking, especially that which
                    underlay his judicial decisions. How an ardent New Deal liberal in the 1930s could emerge as a rock
                    solid believer in judicial restraint and a defender of governmental power at the expense of the
                    individual's civil rights by the 1950s without changing his populist sympathies is a fascinating
                    subject that the authors handle beautifully. At the same time, while their sympathy and admiration
                    for Minton are quite evident, their evaluations of his decisions are coolly objective.
            What the authors set themselves to do they have done very well, so perhaps one should not criticize
                    them for the book they did not intend to write. It does seem a shame, however, that given the
                    opportunity to produce a definitive biography of Minton, they limited themselves largely to his
                    public life. Readers learn that Minton had a wife and, almost as an aside in the last chapter, three
                    children and a number of grandchildren. They also learn that he became a Catholic because his
                    funeral was in a Catholic church. The reticence is all the

                     more surprising because a major source for the work was Mary
                    Anne Callanan, Minton's daughter. Minton the politician and jurist is well limned; Minton the man is
                    not.
            For all that, this is a fine scholarly work that should be stimulating reading for anyone interested
                    in Indiana and national politics in the 1930s, Minton's work on the Court of Appeals, and most
                    especially the interactions and decisions of the Vinson and early 
                        Warren
                     Supreme Court.

            This is the first time that I have reviewed a biography of a person whom I have met. Sister M.
                    Madeleva Wolff, C.S.C., president of St. Mary's College, Notre Dame (1934-1961), read poetry at a
                    student convocation at my college soon after her retirement. My president chose me among several
                    humanities faculty to join the two of them for lunch. As Sister Madeleva took her seat at the head
                    of the table, I peered into a face outlined by the fan-shaped wimple of her order and discovered a
                        grande dame. She exuded the intellectual gentility that characterized the
                    Christian cultural milieu for which St. Mary's was known.
            Sister Madeleva (1887-1964) stated two opinions I have not forgotten after nearly forty years. She
                    disliked coeducation (my college was Indiana's first Catholic college to admit men and women)
                    because women should have their own educational goals and not be evaluated by men's standards. Her
                    second opinion was that, since God is love (I John 4:18), divine justice is secondary; He would
                    abolish hell at the end of time.
            Gail Porter Mandell, humanistic studies professor at St. Mary's, presents the intimate story of the
                    spiritual and intellectual journey that took Sister Madeleva from her rural birthplace to study at
                    the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                    ; from teaching before she finished her studies at St. Mary's to earning the first
                    doctorate awarded a nun at Berkeley; from joining the Sisters of the Holy Cross to spending a
                    sabbatical year at 
                        Oxford
                     and in Europe; from heading a struggling 
                        Utah
                     college to founding the first graduate program in Catholic theology that admitted
                    sisters and laypersons; from letting students smoke on campus to recruiting the first black students
                    at St. Mary's;  from accepting the commands of narrow-minded
                    superiors to recommending that talented sisters undertake graduate study in reputable secular
                    institutions.
            A Catholic, religious, and female, Sister Madeleva nonetheless made lifelong friends out of her
                    Protestant, agnostic, and Jewish male professors at a large state university. She was a nun who
                    wrote poetry that seemed to make little distinction between sexual love and love of God. The
                    daughter of a Lutheran harness maker, her network of friends, acquaintances, and visitors included
                    Edith Whar-ton, G. K Chesterton, Frank Sheed, Jacques Maritain, William Butler Yeats, Mortimer
                    Adler, C. S. Lewis, Clare Booth Luce, Helen Hayes, and Conrad Hilton. She was a Republican, and her
                    role model was the medieval Abbess Hilda of Whitby. She was equally at home supervising the campus
                    gardener and conversing with John XXIII or John F. Kennedy.
            Sister Madeleva was expected to live by the rules and restrictions of the convent, but by publishing
                    over twenty books, including thirteen volumes of religious poetry and an autobiography, she became a
                    major Indiana author.
            Mandell has used the extensive materials preserved in St. Mary's and other archives, the
                    autobiography, and interviews with family, religious sisters, and friends. She has revealed Sister
                    Madeleva's life for all to see and has had the full cooperation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross to
                    accomplish her task. Mandell confirms my luncheon impression: here was an extraordinary, gifted
                    woman.

               Where God's People Meet: A Guide to Significant Religious Places in Indiana. By
                    Joseph M. White. Photographs by Kim Charles Ferrill. (Carmel: Guild Press of Indiana, 1996. Pp. xvi,
                    202. Illustrations, map, index. Paperbound, $19.95.)
            In 1976 Dr. Grover Hartman, executive director of the Indiana Council of Churches, introduced many
                    Hoosiers to the architectural riches of their state's religious sites with what became a yearly
                    series of automobile tours. Hartman was also instrumental in the founding of the Indiana Religious
                    History Association, which has now published a guide written in his honor. The book will delight
                    anyone interested in the religious history of the state. Joseph M. White provides a well-annotated
                    volume, divided by region and county, which covers hundreds of religiously significant sites across
                    Indiana. Churches, synagogues, mosques, monasteries, houses, and college buildings are among the
                    sites included. Each entry includes relevant dates (such as a congregation's founding dates and the
                    dates of previous and  present buildings), an identification of
                    architectural style, and street address or other specific location. Many entries are preceded by
                    codes, some of which indicate sites on the National Register of Historic Places or other
                    architectural and historical registers. White has also selected and coded a number of "Must
                    See" sites that possess "extraordinary architectural or historical
                    importance"; these notations are often more detailed than others. The book is generously
                    illustrated with an excellent series of photographs.
            The only quibble with such a volume is that it tempts the reader to hit the road with book in hand
                    but then proves to be a somewhat frustrating resource to use. The book, otherwise beautifully
                    produced, contains one slim index, and that only of each Indiana county. Readers looking for the
                    sites in a specific town, or looking for a specific site in they-know-not-what town (much less
                    county), will sometimes be hard-pressed to find the information they require. Some of the author's
                    "Must See" sites can be located in a front listing of the book's photographs, but
                    a separate index of all these sites would also have been nice. This criticism, however, arises more
                    from the quality of the book than from any lack thereof. With so many entries, and so many tempting
                    photographs, the dedicated student of religious history in Indiana will simply have to gather up a
                    state roadmap along with the book and mark destinations beforehand. My own next "Must
                    See" is the Art Deco style Tyson United Methodist Church in 
                        Versailles
                    . If this book so stimulates the interest of every reader, it will prove to be a fitting
                    and lasting tribute to the work of Grover Hartman.

               God's Ordinary People: No Ordinary Heritage. By Jessica L. Rousselow and Alan H.
                    Winquist. (Upland, Ind.: Taylor University Press, 1996. Pp. xvi, 345. Illustrations, notes.
                    Paperbound, $12.75.)
            The book, primarily an institutional history by two Taylor University faculty members, was published
                    by the university's press for its sesquicentennial celebration. A well-researched and engaging
                    narrative, it is a useful institutional history of Taylor University, a Methodist Episcopal
                    institution. It is also a contribution to Indiana's educational history, the history of higher
                    education, and women's history.
            The authors see two currents persistently flowing through Taylor University's legacy: (1) its liberal
                    arts emphasis, derived from an originally classical curriculum; (2) international missionary
                    service, stemming from Bishop William Taylor's interest in Africa. Their  examination of the university's unique identity and mission is
                    appropriate reading for the present time when many institutions, especially those that originated
                    under church auspices, are redefining their identities and renewing their missions.
            Focusing on women's education from 1846 to 1890, chapter one treats the origins of the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Female College, founded by the Methodist Episcopal church in 1846 as a women's liberal
                    arts college. The authors ably present the college's early history within a framework of
                    nineteenth-century events in Indiana and the 
                        United States
                    . While remaining committed to women's education, the institution, renamed Fort 
                        Wayne
                     College, became coeducational in 1855. Its curriculum remained heavily oriented to
                    classical languages and literature. In 1890 the institution, renamed Taylor University, began to
                    offer diversified programs consisting of the normal (teacher education), scientific, classical,
                    music, business, medical, and arts curricula. In 1891 Taylor University moved from Fort 
                        Wayne
                     to Upland, Indiana. While always grounded in Methodism, the institution's evangelical
                    orientation and values were revived in the 1890s.
            Chapter two is a biography of Bishop Taylor, for whom the university is named. A vigorous Methodist
                    clergyman, Taylor initiated worldwide missionary activities but was especially concerned with
                    Africa. Developing the "Pauline strategy," Taylor believed that missions should be
                    economically self-sustaining. He energetically founded Methodist mission stations in
                            
                  South Africa, Liberia,
                            Angola
               , and the Congo. Taylor's evangelical zeal was
                    a powerful influence on Taylor University's missionary ethos.
            Chapter three describes the university's student organizations and activities, particularly those
                    involving women. Publications such as the yearbook and newspaper are examined for their general
                    descriptions of student life as well as their references to women's issues. Women's participation in
                    campus literary and debating societies not only afforded public-speaking experience but was also a
                    way to discuss issues such as temperance and suffrage. Still other student organizations, reflecting
                    the institution's Methodism, encouraged religious observance and commitment.
            Chapter three also provides an excellent history of Taylor University's organization, curriculum, and
                    faculty. Noting university reorganization into academically specialized divisions and departments,
                    the authors clearly ascribe the movement to greater profes-sionalization. A very interesting section
                    describes the contributions, accompanied by biographical sketches, of key women faculty members. The
                    narrative fairly examines academic conflicts and disappointments as well as achievements.
            Chapters four, five, and six, entitled "To The Corners of the Earth," return to
                    Taylor University's role in preparing missionaries for international assignments, particularly in
                    Africa and Asia. Though  this section of the book consists
                    primarily of an interesting series of biographies, the authors' theoretical appraisal portrays
                    missionary efforts as paternalist, transitional, or modern. Several biographical sketches are of
                    such noteworthy individuals as Bishop Ralph Dodge, who served in Rhodesia as that country moved
                    toward its independence as Zimbabwe. Although the authors are generally laudatory, they point out
                    conflicts and tensions relating to Methodist missionary endeavors.
            Nicely illustrated, the book provides a biographical listing of significant Methodist missionaries
                    prior to 1945. It is well documented with useful endnote citations; unfortunately, it lacks an
                    index.

               Studebaker: The Life and Death of an American Corporation. By Donald T.
                    Critchlow. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1996. Pp. x, 273. Illustrations, notes, tables, selected
                    bibliography, index. $39.95.)
            Historian Donald T. Critchlow fits the Studebaker story into the larger study of business history in
                    America. He argues that "tradition—as construed by management—played
                    a fundamental role in molding corporate culture, rhetoric, and strategy at Studebaker" (p.
                    7).
            Studebaker was founded as a wagon company in 
                        South Bend
                    , Indiana, in 1852 by the Studebaker brothers, who were sons of German Dunkard parents.
                    These five brothers had a strong sense of piety and noblesse oblige. They opposed unions but
                    "viewed themselves as Christian businessmen who espoused harmony between the social orders
                    through community obligation and social responsibility" (p. 8). They paid the highest wages
                    in 
                        South Bend
                     and built their company into the largest wagonmaker in the 
                        United States
                    , employing five hundred men and grossing over $1 million by 1875.
            Interestingly, the Studebakers sometimes wanted an active role for government in American society.
                    During the Panic of 1893, for example, Clement Studebaker urged Congress to start a public works
                    program to halt unemployment. Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist party leader, said, "If all
                    employers of labor were like Peter Studebaker, there would be no strikes. He is a true friend of
                    workingmen" (p. 29).
            The transition from wagons and carriages to cars was a tough one for the Studebakers. William C.
                    Durant, the founder of General Motors, made the switch from carriages to cars in his own business
                    life, but the Studebakers needed help from an in-law, Frederick Fish. The Studebakers, who were
                    committed to the old wagon technology, eased their way out of active involvement with the company
                    and let  Fish and a new management team compete with Durant and
                    Henry Ford.
            The Studebaker traditions were not forgotten. Albert R. Ersk-ine, who ran the company in the 1920s,
                    invoked the Studebaker name as a symbol and as a memory of good will and good labor relations. The
                    Great Depression devastated Studebaker, and the company went into receivership; when Paul G. Hoffman
                    and Harold Vance took over and made Studebaker profitable again, they used the company tradition of
                    good employer-employee relations to deal effectively with the automobile unions.
            Studebaker, as Critchlow shows, flourished during World War II but fell into decline in the 1950s.
                    The company failed to modernize and lost its market share to the Big Three—Ford, General
                    Motors, and Chrysler. Studebaker merged with Packard in 1954, but this only delayed the inevitable.
                    The company shut down in 1963, one of the last of the independent automakers.
            Critchlow's book is a useful history of an important American company. The history of Studebaker
                    provides a useful look at why it is so hard for successful entrepreneurs to perpetuate their success
                    from generation to generation and new technology to newer technology.

                    essay, index. $35.00.)
            The proliferation of research on early 
                        Ohio
                     during the past two decades has prompted several scholarly reassessments of the role of
                    the state in the development of the Old Northwest and the trans-Appalachian frontier generally.
                    These works have explored such issues as cultural interchanges, the contest for empire,
                    republicanism, and the market economy. While touching on similar themes, The 
                            Ohio
                         Frontier occupies a slightly different niche in this genre. It is intended to
                    be a popular account and is based almost entirely on recent secondary works. It thus does not
                    include footnotes, but readers can find the references in an excellent and comprehensive
                    bibliographical essay.
            The first five chapters grapple with the relations among the native inhabitants of the 
                        Ohio
                     country, the French, the British, and the Americans before 1795. Hurt sees the
                    well-known episodes of the early frontier as a series of complex accommodations among natives and
                    Europeans in their mutual struggle for control. It is gratifying to find this more recent
                    interpretation in a popular account, but some  readers may still
                    be left with the uncomfortable impression that all that mattered in the end was Anthony 
                        Wayne
                    's triumph at Fallen Timbers and the 1795 Treaty of Greenville that opened much of 
                        Ohio
                     to American settlement.
            The American occupation of 
                        Ohio
                     is covered in the next five chapters, which include accounts of surveying, the founding
                    of selected towns, farm practices and products, merchant trade, and religion, all based closely on
                    familiar recent scholarship. The separate sections are generally interesting and lively, but
                    analysis that might forge useful links and integrate them into a single smoothly flowing narrative
                    is missing. More importantly, gaps and omissions sometimes actually distort the early history of 
                        Ohio
                     and make it difficult to understand underlying issues.
            Chapter ten on the religious frontier is a case in point. The author includes a general discussion of
                    the Methodists but covers Presbyterians only from the study of a single town. He pays considerably
                    more attention to the numerically smaller Shakers, Quakers, and Separatists at Zoar. Two of the most
                    important denominations— the Congregationalists and the Baptists—are hardly
                    mentioned. These omissions and the failure to explore the implications of denominational friction
                    are unfortunate because religion provides an important context for understanding migration to the
                    frontier, settlement patterns, social and cultural relationships, and political divisions.
            The final three chapters return to the struggles between the native inhabitants and the Americans
                    during the War of 1812, contain more material on market-oriented farming, and finally discuss the
                    emergence of manufacturing and the canal movement. Tiny sections on women, foreign settlers, and
                    persons of African descent are insufficient, even given the relatively small amount of scholarship
                    on these subjects. Hurt ends his account abruptly and without any attempt to draw conclusions about
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     experience or to provide a greater context for understanding its role in the
                    development of the Old Northwest.

                     Civil War Centennial Commission. In 1963 it appeared as a paperback under the aegis of

                        Wisconsin
                    . The present version reflects revisions that Klement was able to make before his death
                    in 1994. There were a number of topics to which, as he remarks in his preface, he had previously
                    "given short shrift." Now there is more attention to "soldier
                    voting-in-the-field, legal and constitutional aspects of the war, the military campaigns of
                    1864-1865, and the story of 
                        Wisconsin
                    's black troops" (p. v). The index, however, does not bear out the promise on
                    the jacket that there is "a brief history of each of 
                        Wisconsin
                    's fifty-three infantry regiments." Several are not mentioned at all, and many
                    of the "histories" are little more than brief references.

                    mention in Element's earlier work. Here the author makes good the omission with respectful attention
                    to the participation of the state's few blacks in the war effort—"irony and
                    more," as Klement comments (p. 93), in view of their exclusion from citizenship. Apart from
                    the supplementary material, the text of this edition is not significantly different from previous
                    versions. The appearance, however, is strikingly improved. The page is enlarged and set in double
                    columns, chapters are numbered, and there are over one hundred well-chosen and aptly placed
                    illustrations of 
                        Wisconsin
                    's soldiers and their leaders.
            As the author remarks, however, the work "still lacks footnotes" (p. v). In their
                    absence it is difficult to determine the source or accuracy of a particular quotation or statement.
                    Passages drawn from Frank A. Haskell's The Battle of 
                            Gettysburg
                        
                (pp. 54-55) contain a number of faulty readings, and one surmises that there
                    may be other similar inaccuracies. For example, the Seventeenth Corps was not present at the Battle
                    of the Crater as Klement states (p. 95). More rigorous editing would have dealt with numerous
                    repetitions; for example, Ulysses S. Grant's dismissal of Robert C. Murphy, colonel of the 8th 
                        Wisconsin
                    , is discussed on page 65 and treated as a new topic three pages later. The
                    participation of 
                        Wisconsin
                     troops at 
                        Gettysburg
                     is described at some length on pages 49-50, then taken up in a new chapter, "

                    its title. More attention to editorial detail would have enhanced its usefulness.

               Muddy Boots and Ragged Aprons: Images of Working-Class 
                            Detroit
                        , 1900-1930. By Kevin Boyle and Victoria Getis. (

            By the 1920s the city of 
                  Detroit, Michigan
               , was a symbol of the rapid
                    urbanization, industrialization, and immigration that had occurred in the 
                        United States
                     in the five decades after the Civil War. Having grown from a population of 45,000 in
                    1865, 
                        Detroit
                     was the nation's thirteenth largest city with a population of nearly 285,000 by 1900.
                    By 1930 
                        Detroit
                    's working-class population had increased to 1.5 million people, and its status as a
                    major industrial center was undisputed.
            The story of 
                        Detroit
                    's industrial, urban, and working-class development in the early twentieth century is
                    not new. Historians have produced a plethora of books and articles examining the working-class city.
                    Most studies, however, have relied on traditional sources such as company records, letters, and
                    diaries, which have not always painted a very vivid picture of everyday working-class life.
            In an effort to document the lives of 
                        Detroit
                    's working class more fully, Kevin Boyle and Victoria Getis have turned to a
                    nontra-ditional source, photographs. In Muddy Boots and Ragged Aprons they have
                    successfully integrated nearly ninety previously unpublished photographs and thought-provoking
                    commentary to paint a broad picture of working-class life in 
                        Detroit
                     in the first three decades of the twentieth century. The photographs are drawn from a
                    variety of archives, including the Ford Industrial Archives, the Ford Historical Museum at 
                        Greenfield
                     Village, and the Archives for Labor and Urban Affairs at 
                        Wayne
                     State University.
            Organized in three sections—Home, Work, and Community— this volume shows the
                    importance of using photographs to document the everyday life of ordinary workers. Ranging from the
                    interior of a working-class bar, to a group of women in the decorating department of the
                    Jeffery-Dewitt Sparkplug factory, to a crowded and unhealthy bedroom, to a social gathering of the
                    Bethel AME Church, the photographs provide important lessons for labor historians and nonacademics
                    alike.
            
            Most strikingly revealed by the photographs is the difference in the standard of living between the
                    middle class, illustrated by Charles Hargraves (p. 40) and Margaret Cummer (p. 44), and the working
                    class, represented by Abdul Amondi and Dom Poccia (p. 52) who labored in the Ford automobile
                    factory. In the Hargraves and Cummer households the photographs include porcelain sinks, bathtubs,
                    toilets, paintings, carpeting, wallpaper, and decorative fireplace mantels. In the photographs
                    depicting working-class households one is startled not by what the occupants had but by what they
                    did not have. The absence of closets, wardrobes, and chairs; the use of scraps of cloth for
                    curtains; and well-worn furniture, linens, and utensils characterized the homes of the working
                    class.
            Boyle and Getis have succeeded in their primary goal: "exploring the everyday life of
                    ordinary people, in all their glory" (p. 19). Muddy Boots and Ragged
                    Aprons provides readers with a window through which to view the complexities of 
                        Detroit
                    's industrialization, immigration, and urbanization. Moreover, the lessons learned from
                    the book's photographs and text can be applied to other cities such as 
                  Cleveland, Pittsburgh
               , and Youngstown during this period.

               Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy. By Annette
                    Gordon-Reed. (
                        Charlottesville

            Did he or didn't he? As far as the American public is concerned, it seems, the verdict is already in:
                    Thomas Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings's children. But Annette Gordon-Reed is not quite so
                    ready to decide. There are, she says, days she wakes up knowing that Jefferson fathered Sally
                    Hemings's children and other days when she is less sure. It might be argued that this is the
                    historian's fate. In the absence of a smoking gun (or in this case a DNA test), one can never be
                    certain. Still, Gordon-Reed's reexamination of the evidence will convince many readers that they can
                    be as sure about the reality of the Hemings-Jefferson relationship as they are about any number of
                    other things.
            Long dismissed by mainstream historians as a politically inspired calumny or an instance of what
                    Freud called the family romance, the story of a relationship between the third president and a slave
                    (who may or may not have been his late wife's half sister) gained new currency when revived in Fawn
                    Brodie's 1974 biography, Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History. But Brodie's
                    claims, based in part on dubious psychologizing and a tendency to overread the Jeffersonian texts,
                         persuaded few in the historical profession. If nothing else,
                    her picture of a passionate long-term relationship seemed remarkably romanticized and blithely
                    ignored the obvious point, that relations between a master and his slave were based on fundamental
                    inequalities of power.
            Gordon-Reed, a law professor, comes at the problem in a different and far more satisfying way. Why,
                    she asks, have historians been so willing to accept the traditions passed down in Jefferson's family
                    (laying the blame at the feet of one or the other of Jefferson's nephews, Peter and Samuel Carr) and
                    so dismissive of the traditions passed down by Sally Hemings's children? Who, she asks, has more to
                    gain in this situation? Her critique of the standards historians have used in weighing these
                    conflicting claims is devastating.
            Gordon-Reed's other trump cards are the remarkable set of circumstances surrounding the births of
                    Sally Hemings's children and the fate of the Hemings family generally. Each of Hemings's children
                    was conceived shortly after Jefferson returned to 
                        Monticello
                     from an extended absence. Of the hundreds of slaves Jefferson owned, only Hemingses
                    were freed during his lifetime or by his will. Does this prove that Jefferson
                    fathered Sally Hemings's children? No, not if one demands absolute proof. But it most certainly
                    raises questions and shifts the burden of explanation to those who deny Jefferson's paternity.
                    Further, it makes it far more difficult for Jefferson's "defenders" to rely on the
                    often profferred argument that it would have been "out of character" for Jefferson
                    to have had an affair with Sally Hemings. (Not all of those who deny Jefferson's paternity, of
                    course, see themselves as "defending" him.)
            In short, this is an important work, with things to say not only about its formal subject but about
                    the practices of historians as well. Students of Jefferson will ignore it at their peril; students
                    of American race relations will find it compelling.

               The Chief Justiceship of John Marshall, 1801-1835. By Herbert A. Johnson. (
                        Columbia

                     Press, 1997. Pp. xii, 317. Notes, illustrations, tables, figures, appendices,
                    bibliography, index. $39.95.)
            Among the long-range projects of gathering and editing the papers of prominent Americans, this volume
                    on the role of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall is an outstanding publication. Herbert A.
                    Johnson brings to the task long experience with the subject. Among his other contributions are the
                    ongoing edition of Marshall's papers and an authored volume, Foundations of Power
                    (1981),  in a set with George Lee Haskins concerning the years
                    1801-1815, the first half of the chief justice's tenure.
            An expert in both law and history, Johnson offers a scholarly, heavily documented description and
                    analysis of his topic. There is also much source material, which many predecessors have sought with
                    limited success. This volume is one in a series on chief justices and will help specialists and
                    generalists understand the impact of the judiciary upon government, indeed on society, during the
                    early national era.
            One of the most valuable parts of the volume is an extensive quantitative presentation of the work of
                    the federal circuit courts on which Marshall and other Supreme Court members, as well as district
                    judges, sat. Johnson classifies archival information by the nature of cases as well as by justices
                    hearing them. He shows the branches of law—constitutional, admiralty, criminal,
                    contracts, real property—in decisions and in positions of each Supreme Court member in
                    each circuit and at 
                        Washington
                    .
            Two samples of the author's handling of the background and hearing of many cases can be mentioned.
                    Johnson does not see Mar-bury v. 
                        
                            Madison
                        
                     (1803) as the principal factor in establishing judicial review, as it is depicted in many
                    quarters. He may be correct, but he is qualifying historical judgments that show the case's large
                    political significance. Johnson is certainly aware of political and economic factors in legal
                    developments. Still, he may not give enough weight to these dynamics. Another example is Green v. Biddle (1824), the land dispute between 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Virginia
                    , which Johnson presents informatively. He discusses the controversy over the court's
                    holding that the constitutional contract clause binds a state as a party to an agreement, but he
                    thinks the court could have invalidated the 
                        Kentucky
                     claimant law because it violated the laws of nature. Despite the blending of natural
                    and positive law at the bar and bench in those days, one cannot find any clause in the Constitution
                    empowering judicial review on that open ground.
            This excellent book portrays a fertile period of legal development.

                    with the gold fever of 1849.
            
            In nineteen elegantly titled chapters—such as "Lost Love, Lost
                    Families"—Rohrbough argues persuasively that the discovery of gold along the
                    American River not only transformed 
                        California
                     and the West generally, it also reshaped the nation as a whole. In so doing, Rohrbough
                    uses the West as a basis for examining issues that touched Americans in every part of the country.
                    He thus achieves regional historians' most desired goal: the illumination of a local subject within
                    its national context, thereby expanding the intellectual boundaries of each.
            Culling diaries, letters, and memoirs found in repositories from 
                        North Carolina
                     to 
                        Oregon
                    , from Indiana to 
                        California
                    , Rohrbough looks at both the new communities of 
                        California
                     and the older ones of the East. What emerges is a rich portrait of Americans,
                    individually and in groups, struggling to cope with social, economic, and political upheaval. The
                    scope of Rohrbough's research affirms his point—the effects of the Gold Rush permeated
                    all corners of the country and left indelible marks on the national experience.
            Rohrbough eschews the perception of the Gold Rush as a glorious example of regional conquest brought
                    about by a lusty group of robust male adventurers. Rather, he looks inside the American family to
                    delineate the painful processes of personal and public decision making that brought so many
                    irreversible changes to the patterns of national life. He paints a compelling picture of the
                    hardships, pleasures, and benefits for those who departed for the gold fields as well as the
                    endeavors, sorrows, and rewards of those who maintained the home.
            Above all, Rohrbough pushes back the male-centered definitions of mining and places
                    women—regardless of their geographic location—at the very core of Gold Rush
                    history. This is a groundbreaking departure from the usual conventions of mining history, which more
                    or less relegates women to the saloons and brothels that dotted the landscape of every boomtown in
                    the West. In contrast, Days of Gold depicts men and women responding in concert to
                    the forces unleashed by the events at Sutter's Mill. This book offers the gender-bonded history so
                    often sought and so seldom produced.
            Rohrbough convincingly shows that this era, its glamour and adventure aside, changed America and its
                    people in complex and permanent ways. Roles for men and women, by the hearth and on the boulevard,
                    altered, as did Americans' cultural perceptions, political vision, and economic experiences.
                    Impressive in research, graceful in design, sound in argument, insightful in interpretation,
                    admirable in presentation, Days of Gold is a significant contribution to the field
                    of mining history and a scholarly standard for all western historians to emulate.

               American Frontiers: Cultural Encounters and Continental Conquest. By Gregory H.

            Readers seeking a straightforward synthesis of the exploding historical literature on North American
                    frontiers will find exactly what they are looking for in this book. Gregory H. Nobles seems to have
                    familiarized himself with virtually everything that scholars have written on the subject. Only two
                    decades ago many historians considered frontier studies essentially dead. It was a field dominated
                    by the legacy of Frederick Jackson Turner, the scholar who posited in an 1893 speech that the impact
                    of settling and resettling supposedly empty lands had made the 
                        United States
                     into an exceptional nation. Turner's adherents published a pile of scholarly monographs
                    that attempted to demonstrate the validity of his interpretation everywhere from colonial New 
                        England
                     to 
                        Australia
                    . Subsequent critics attacked Turner and his followers, pointing to evidence that
                    undermined their sometimes unsubtle equation of the frontier with democracy, equality, and
                    individualism. By the 1970s the argument had become stale. What more was there to be said on the
                    subject?
            Plenty, as Nobles's book makes clear. A generation of scholars has revitalized the field by thinking
                    of frontier studies in terms of multicultural encounters. They have emphasized the roles of women,
                    Indians, Hispanics, Africans, and others in both carrying out and resisting the expansion of the 
                        United States
                    . Above all, they have argued that frontier history must be understood as a story of
                    often savage and duplicitous conquest rather than benign settlement.
            Nobles discusses these historiographical debates in an effective introduction. He then writes a
                    narrative of frontier encounters that begins with the initial arrival of English-speaking peoples in
                    eastern North America in the early 1600s and ends with the official closing of the frontier in 1890.
                    The chapters are lively and efficient presentations of the evidence and interpretations in the
                    recent literature. Nobles strives for balance both in content and tone; there is no dichotomy
                    between good and bad guys. American Frontiers is not a polemic. Instead of
                    attacking other historians, Nobles concentrates on constructing a reliable and readable story.
                    Judged on these terms, his book is a success.
            For all the sound and fury of revisionism, however, Nobles's book is surprisingly similar in its
                    overall contours to the frontier syntheses written decades ago by historians such as Frederick Merk
                    and Ray Allen Billington. He is more critical of American policies; he takes Indians seriously, not
                    just as people in the way of American expansion; and he devotes considerable attention to such
                    relatively new subjects as African Americans and environmentalism. Still, American
                        Frontiers tells a very familiar tale: how, for good or ill, English-speaking peoples in the
                    course of a couple of centuries occupied  and transformed most of
                    the North American continent into one of the most dynamic and powerful nations in the history of the
                    world. In its basic outline this narrative has a power far beyond our ability to bend it to our
                    purposes, no matter how much we argue about what we ought to call it.

               The Minds of the West: Ethnocultural Evolution in the Rural Middle West,
                    1830-1917. By Jon Gjerde. (

                        North Carolina
                     Press, 1997. Pp. xiii, 426. Maps, tables, notes, index. $39.95.)
            The Middle West has the well-deserved reputation of being distinctly "American."
                    This designation covers a range of distinctions, of which not-being-like-Europe is critical. But how
                    could it be that the region is so different from Europe when so many of its people came from Europe,
                    and not so very long ago? For Jon Gjerde the answer lies in a convergence of attitudes and values.
                    The pioneer settlers were joined after the 1840s by millions of immigrants from Europe. Gjerde is
                    especially concerned with the largest and least studied group, the Germans, and their interaction
                    with the Yankees. The book, although it touches upon many midwestern points, is centered in a
                    one-hundred-mile radius around 
                  Dubuque, Iowa
               , which itself was the epicenter of
                    Germania.
            Gjerde ranges widely over social, political, and intellectual themes, with much on farming, religion,
                    marriages, and children, and with some attention to education and occupation. Migration is a major
                    theme, as he demonstrates how communities reassembled themselves in the New World. Would they
                    isolate themselves and echo the old country (as the French did in 
                        Canada
                    ), or would they interact with and learn from other groups, change and Americanize
                    themselves? Would America be balkanized with groups hating and killing each other? (Gjerde does
                    chronicle the intergroup violence, but there was not very much.) The Germans had a strong tendency
                    to become farmers. Indeed, they tended to stay in agriculture long after other groups moved on to
                    the towns and cities, so the chapters on rural life are especially revealing. The Germans were
                    strikingly religious, although the Lutheran half warred with the Catholic half whenever it was not
                    battling heretical Lutherans or dangerous secularists. The Scandinavians are well represented, and
                    Gjerde contrasts their lifestyle and Lutheranism with that of the Germans. He is effective in
                    showing how the immigrants built their own uniquely American churches and used them as a base to
                    establish family roles and moral  standards. He also shows how
                    the immigrants succumbed to the lure of American individualism.
            The Germans brought with them strong family and community ties and built strong churches here
                    (especially the 
                        Missouri
                     Synod and 
                        Wisconsin
                     Synod Lutherans). Yet they were practical people who took advantage of their financial
                    opportunities and thereby became more individualistic and less beholden to their ministers, elders,
                    and community notables. The Yankees took the lead in aggressive modernization, trying, as promoters
                    of temperance, antislavery, education, and corporations, to convert everyone to their social,
                    economic, political, and ethical viewpoint. But the Yankees were too frenzied, too obtrusive, too
                    immoderate for the Germans, and conflict repeatedly erupted in politics, especially regarding the
                    prohibition issue. Simply put, the Yankees (in alliance with the Scandinavians) attempted to dry up
                    the Midwest and put German beer out of business.
            Gjerde's text moves gracefully among many different types of evidence and styles of writing. The book
                    is full of tables, but also of revealing pithy quotes from newspapers (especially 
                        Dubuque
                    's foreign language press), and from diaries, letters, and memoirs as well. Political
                    historians will appreciate the author's fine coverage of the eth-nocultural theme in politics,
                    especially the raging debates over liquor, schooling, and women's rights. The outcome is not
                    told—Gjerde touches too lightly on the decisive years of World War I. He or another
                    equally talented historian needs to bring the story up to date to show how the descendants of
                    Germans and Swedes, Yankees and southerners, have become indistinguishable individualists today,
                    each learning from and teaching the others, each forgetting their cultural heritage.

               Main Street Revisited: Time, Space, and Image Building in Small-Town America. By
                    Richard V. Francaviglia. (

            In each of our respective pasts, there exists some form of Main Street—a place that evokes
                    recollections of the corner drugstore, memories of simpler times, or images of a vibrant and
                    bustling community. Whether it exists in the quaint countryside of New 
                        England
                    , the farming communities of the American heartland, towns of the Southwest, or simply
                    as a part of our collective memory, Main Street has been visible in our history, culture, and built
                    environment since the beginning of American settlement. Fascinated by its central role in our lives,
                    Richard V. Francaviglia has spent decades gathering images from small towns across the American
                    landscape and studying the evolution of this corridor as both physical space and cultural  phenomenon. This highly readable and intriguing volume brings together
                    his observations about how time, space, and popular images merged to create a place that has become
                    the symbol of small-town America and, in many ways, America as a whole.
            Relying upon historic and contemporary photographs, town plans, maps, and fieldwork, Francaviglia
                    explores the diverse regional patterns of America's small towns in order to understand the emergence
                    and meaning of communities. Since his primary interest as a historical geographer is in the way
                    people utilized both time and space to create place, the author "reads" his towns
                    and their histories through their material culture—the buildings, physical designs, and
                    public spaces. He argues, for example, that the transition in architectural styles along Main
                    Street—from residential to assorted commercial forms and the incorporation of catalog
                    storefronts, plate glass, and stylized architecture—gave each streetscape a distinct
                    personality and revealed how the town perceived itself and wished others to see it at different
                    points in time. Likewise, the author's analysis of street plans, shapes of property parcels, and the
                    presence of public spaces (parks, courthouse squares) uncovers distinct regional characteristics
                    that reveal how people viewed and used their townscapes.
            While most of the book deals with concrete issues of town development, the last chapter focuses on
                    the popular image of Main Street. Here, Francaviglia explores how Main Street became a part of our
                    collective consciousness and how it ultimately came to represent a sense of traditional American
                    values and community. In doing so, he describes how Walt Disney incorporated a fictive Main Street
                    as the core of his theme parks (a practice replicated by other amusement centers) in order to evoke
                    memories (and myths) of past times and values. The author argues convincingly that Main Street,
                    especially as reinterpreted by Disney, has been a major influence in the development of modern-day
                    downtown commercial centers and suburban shopping malls.
            His major contribution to the examination of small towns is a list of sixteen axioms or
                    generalizations. These accurately describe how Main Streets have grown since colonial times and are
                    certainly useful for any local history practitioner or observer. Of special interest to Hoosier
                    readers is the credit given to the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana for a composite graphic
                    illustrating the evolution of architectural styles in America's towns, an item to which the author
                    refers regularly to support his themes.
            Francaviglia uses Main Street as a medium by which to study the past, present, and future of
                    small-town America. In so doing, he takes his readers on an enjoyable and illuminating walk down
                    Main Street USA. From this excursion readers will assuredly become more cognizant of their
                    surrounding environs, more inquiring about how their communities developed, and, one hopes, more
                    interested in the  meaning of small towns amidst the urban and
                    suburban growth of contemporary America.

            The motel is a quintessentially American institution and one that is central to the American cultural
                    experience. Yet its history, like the history of roads and of motor transport, has been slighted.
                    This neglect stems in part from problems in locating sources about a mode of mobility that is
                    primarily individualistic and a service infrastructure that has not retained a coherent body of
                    archival records. It also results from the magnitude and diversity of the subject of land
                    transportation. Where do academics begin when assessing motor mobility generally and roadside
                    lodgings in particular? A study of motels, defined as roadside accommodations, involves not only the
                    sweep of twentieth-century history but also landscape geography, architecture, planning, business
                    management, changing patterns of consumerism, and cultural interactions. It is thus fitting that
                    this interdisciplinary topic should be discussed by two geographers and a historian. Readers may
                    have to use the index to gain the specific information that they require, but they will be
                    effectively informed and greatly entertained.
            The authors explore the place of the motel in American society, examining its origins, evolution, and
                    geographical distribution and its changing social and cultural contexts. The book proceeds
                    chronologically, although this chronology is interspersed with thematic chapters examining motel
                    architecture, motels in Albuquerque, and two chains, the early 
                        Alamo
                     Plaza Hotel Courts and Holiday Inns. Motels began with rental cabins and cabin courts
                    in the first three decades of the century. By the 1930s they had become easier to recognize and
                    document. Roadside accommodations increased rapidly in the 1930s and then again in the two decades
                    after World War II. They peaked at 61,000 units in 1961, after which they declined in number but not
                    in rooms available for hire. By 1994 there were 3.1 million rooms available in hotels and motels.
            Motels also changed markedly in style. Even in the early 1960s most were independent operations. The
                    individualistic "mom and pop" enterprises were, however, fading in the face of
                    referral chains of cooperating motels, motel trade associations, and ownership chains.  The next quarter century witnessed the growth of branded motel
                    franchising. By 1987 64 percent of the country's units were part of a lodgings network, with the top
                    five chains providing nearly 30 percent of the rooms for hire. To attract investment and to convince
                    the nation's travelers of motel utility and respectability, owners had developed
                    "place-product-packaging." This type of chain was owned by a single person or
                    corporate entity, and all branches had the same name, the same architecture, and the same interior
                    room decor and offered the same range of services. Travelers then knew what to expect. For those
                    customers who wanted a differentiated service, moteliers developed a range of budget-luxury lodging
                    brands. By this time motels had become trend setters for modern living. Introducing many clients to
                    such novel commodities as color television, coffee makers, and residential swimming pools, they
                    molded American culture as well as being shaped by it. Much remains to be ascertained about the
                    motel as an essential part of American society, but the authors have provided both a remarkable
                    start and an agenda for future inquiry.

                        At hand is a short memoir by George Cary Eggleston describing his experiences as a
                                    teacher on Riker's Ridge (also spelled Ryk-er's Ridge) in 
                                        Jefferson County
                                    , northeast of 
                                        Madison
                                    , which his brother Edward Eggleston re-used in his novel The Hoosier Schoolmaster. This incident interests me.
                        Charley Grebe, aged 21 and the strongest boy in the School, made a deal with the new
                                    young schoolmaster—age 16!—that he would keep order in the
                                    school if the master would truly teach him math, "instead of just
                                    pretending, like the rest." It was his ambition to become a shipwright, for
                                    which he needed to know "arithmetic, algebra, and at least the rudiments of
                                    trigonometry."
                        The agreement was mutually satisfactory. Eggleston did teach him; he became an
                                    apprentice, and discipline was exemplary. Eggleston did not know whether he achieved
                                    his goal and did indeed become a shipwright.
                        Does any reader know his later history?

               Editor's Note. This list of articles, books, pamphlets, and dissertations published
                    from 1993 through 1997 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's history. The list
                    will normally appear in each March issue of the Indiana Magazine of History. Since
                    no list of this kind can ever be exhaustive, we hope that readers will help us by sending items for
                    possible future inclusion. We are especially interested in listing publications that contribute to
                    the understanding of Indiana's past but that are not usually reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will
                    not list newspaper articles or accounts of local historical society activities, but printed
                    pamphlets as well as journal articles may be listed. All such items for the March, 1999, issue must
                    be received by November 1, 1998. Many people have contributed to the present list, but major
                    responsibility has rested with Leigh Darbee of the Indiana Historical Society.
