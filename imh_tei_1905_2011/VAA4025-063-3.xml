            <p>Indiana voters awaited the presidential election of 1824 with a growing
                    conviction that they had come of age for national politics. A writer in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi> no doubt expressed the sentiments of many of his
                    fellow citizens when he proudly announced the demise of the West as "a
                    feudal appendage to the republic." During the territorial period the
                    West had had no vote in Congress, but, this writer proclaimed: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Time … has worked wonderful changes in our condition. Instead
                            of being the supplicants—instead of bowing and cringing to
                            our elders—we have, beyond a precedent in the history of
                            nations, ripened into maturity, &amp; taken our rank among our
                            sister states. It is for us to improve the advantage—instead
                            of obedience, we now have the right to command, and should we remain
                            united, the question of the next president must be left to us.</p>
                    </quote> With the bravado of a frontiersman who felt himself the equal of all
                    challengers, this Westerner assured his "Atlantic brethren"
                    that the time was fast approaching "when the seat of empire will be

            <p>It is impossible to know if all voters in the state were this excited about the
                    forthcoming election, but the evidence suggests that many were. In the two
                    previous presidential contests in which Indiana had participated, there had been
                    little objection to the selection of the state's electors by the
                    general assembly, since voters strongly supported the Jeffersonian Republicans
                    and their candidate, James <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>. But by 1824 the Era of Good Feelings had drawn to a close. The
                    Republican party openly split into factions; and several presidential
                    candidates, each wishing to be the party's standard bearer, won varying
                    degrees of support. The election of 1824, the first true presidential contest in
                    Indiana, was <list type="footnotes">

                    act by the general assembly on January 14, 1824, giving voters the right to
                    choose the state's five presidential electors.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taking advantage of this change in the law, 37.5 per cent of Indiana's
                    eligible voters participated in the presidential election. The national average
                    was 26.5 per cent, and in only five of the other seventeen states in which
                    voters selected presidential electors was there a greater percentage of turnout.
                    Indiana's record is especially impressive compared with some of the
                    older states. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> 29.1 per cent of the eligible voters expressed their presidential
                    preferences; in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, 19.6 per cent; and in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, 11.5 per cent.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This political interest is even more striking when viewed against the frontier
                    conditions of Indiana in the 1820's. Roads were few, and the isolated,
                    self-sufficient farmer seldom traveled far from his homestead or had visitors
                    from distant parts of the state.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Nevertheless, he did
                    manage to have some contact with politics. Office seekers were often present at
                    auctions, at the county seat on court days, or at logrollings and cabin
                    raisings. Seasoned politicians traveled about the state from settlement to
                    settlement, homestead to homestead, seeking support and discussing issues. Even
                    circuit-riding ministers could sometimes be relied upon for political news, and
                    some of them attempted to win support for their favorite candidates.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The militia musters of the period frequently served more
                    as social and political meetings than as exercises in military training.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Despite handicaps, Indiana citizens managed to enter
                    national politics with a fervor that has characterized the state ever since.
                    Their attitude was typified by a meeting of citizens in <placeName>

            <p>Newspapers were the major source of information about national politics in early
                    Indiana, and as such they usually left much to be desired. This was not always
                    the fault of the editors, who had difficulty operating their businesses in what
                    was largely a barter economy, who were often hard pressed to find sufficient
                    news for even their small four-page weeklies, and who at times could not obtain
                    newsprint to maintain regular publication.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Editors often
                    reprinted items from papers of other states and thus offered at least a glimpse
                    of the national scene. However, the news reported did not have the immediacy
                    found in contemporary papers, and it often lacked continuity.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> While this was a serious shortcoming, it gave the papers a temporary
                    timelessness which encouraged people to read and reread them regardless of
                    datelines. The good quality of rag paper on which they were printed made it
                    possible for them to pass through many hands, and the limited number of
                    subscribers to a paper was not always an indication of the number of people who
                    read it. <list type="footnotes">

                    being published in Indiana in 1824,<hi rend="sup">10</hi> giving the state one
                    paper for about every 10,500 inhabitants. The national average at this time was
                    one paper for about every 16,000 inhabitants.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Although
                    newspapers were crude by modern standards, their circulation limited, and their
                    editors often politically unsophisticated, the absence of any competing news
                    media enhanced their significance.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>The presidential election of 1824 was the first national campaign in which
                    Indiana editors showed significant interest, and it has often been described as
                    one which involved personalities more than issues.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The
                    basis on which individual voters were attracted to particular candidates is
                    difficult to assess, and personality may well have been the decisive factor.
                    However, even though political issues were much less sophisticated then than
                    now, and people expected less from the national government than they have since
                    come to do, the newspapers in the state exhibited a strong concern for the
                    importance of issues in the election. While Adams' impeccable morality
                    was stressed by his supporters, his opponents publicized his voting record in
                    Congress. <placeName>

                    discredit his political views.</p>
            <p>Since editors tried to reflect and to influence public opinion, their concern for
                    issues is an indication that they, at least, felt that more than personality was
                    involved. Their <list type="footnotes">

                    generalizations based upon an examination of the state's newspapers are
                    in part a distortion, since few people could have had access to all the papers

                    Information and opinions that a voter found in his local paper were probably
                    supplemented by political discussion and gossip. This combination could give him
                    material for thought comparable to the collective image which emerges from a

            <p>The political issues that emerged in the Indiana newspapers were complex and

                    candidates by caucus, republican principles, the national bank, militarism,
                    slavery, the tariff, internal improvements, and sectionalism. Intertwined with

            <p>The issue which received most attention in the state's newspapers and
                    around which other issues gravitated concerned which candidate best represented
                    the republican principles of his party. These principles were never defined
                    during the campaign, but as represented they often contained a strong expression
                    of the growing desire for increased democracy.</p>
            <p>Early in the campaign Crawford was portrayed in various Indiana newspapers as the
                    logical choice of the Republican party. One writer predicted in 1822 that his
                    "unchangeable republican principles" would secure his
                    election. Another reminded voters that Crawford had a strong claim to party
                    support, since seven years earlier, though not a candidate, the congressional
                    caucus had given him only a few votes less than <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> for the presidential nomination. Thus at this early date
                    "near one half of the republican representatives of the nation
                    acknowledged his worth." This person predicted that the political
                    struggle in 1824 would be between Crawford and Adams, "or in other
                    words, between republicanism and aristocracy."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    </placeName> Weekly Intelligencer, endorsed Crawford in 1822 in the belief that
                    "his virtues, talents, firmness and patriotism will ever be
                    recollected, and rewarded by the free citizens of this Western

                    impartial" management of the Treasury Department and the relief that
                    his policies had given to western debtors. A table of estimated and actual
                    treasury receipts from 1802 to 1821 was printed to substantiate the claim that
                    Crawford had been more accurate than any of his predecessors.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>Crawford did receive the congressional caucus nomination, although less than half
                    the members attended. But the man whose republican principles had been praised
                    was soon denounced for having subverted them. Caucus nomination had become so
                    unpopular that on January 7, 1824, Thomas H. Blake introduced a resolution in
                    the Indiana House of Representatives condemning the practice as a threat to
                    "the sacred rights, and prosperity and happiness of the American
                    people." The resolution declared that it was the constitutional right
                    of the people to elect the president and vice president "and that any
                    attempt by congressional nominations … to exercise this invaluable
                    privilege … should be regarded by the American people as a dangerous
                    encroachment on their rights, tending to ruin the Republic." Final

                    Indiana which was detrimental to Crawford. The secretary had been the first of
                    the leading contenders to seek organized support in the state, but he was the
                    least successful. His position as secretary of the treasury gave him influence
                    over state banking, which he hoped to use as the basis for creating a political
                    machine. Dealing with Senator James Noble, he designated the Indiana state bank,
                    with headquarters at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    1821-1822, costing stockholders over $200,000, ended

            <p>Left without organized support, Crawford was attacked by his opponents, who

                    "it is difficult to say." But a guess could be ventured:

                    In fact, when Adams announced his candidacy, it was charged that the entire
                    Federal party in most of the states came to his support. Therefore, it would be
                    "political suicide" for Republicans to support him.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Adams, wrote one of his opponents, had his

                    "the old man and his son thought proper to change their sentiments
                    about the same time—for the old politician may have thought this
                    necessary to secure the son's advancement." But this was a
                    change based on expediency. The candidate did not possess the "fixed
                    political principles," the "pure patriotism," or the

                    elect Adams by supporting Jackson. Since, according to the editor, the

                    members supporting Adams had held a secret caucus to devise ways to further his
                    election. The editor observed that the "people of Indiana are generally
                    opposed to a Congressional caucus, and the friends of Mr. Adams have been loud
                    in their denunciation of the measure"; but should the report be true,

            <p>Since Adams was popular with the Quakers, an attempt was made to discredit this
                    group. Buxton reprinted one such effort which expressed alarm that many western
                    preachers and Quakers throughout the nation were supporting Adams. The article
                    recalled the "direful consequences" which had resulted from
                    the friendship "between Episcopalian priests and followers of William
                    Penn, and the mother country, during the revolutionary war." Buxton
                    retorted that "such base slanders deserve the severest
                    reprehension." He denied that Quakers had ever associated with
                    Episcopalian priests and explained that <placeName>

            <p>In addition to leveling general charges against Adams' republicanism,
                    his opponents also disparaged his record in Congress. Indiana citizens were
                    reminded that in 1803 Adams as a senator was one of a minority of six against
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Purchase, only because "party zeal blinded [him] to the
                    interest of the country." On January 26, 1804, he voted against
                    prohibiting the foreign slave trade in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>; and on October 31, 1803, he opposed "wearing crape one

                    distinguished friends of virtue and liberty."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>The Adams men claimed a foul at this, demanding: "Is this fair? Is it

                    in your councils whose character could stand a test like this?" They
                    explained that Adams had favored the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Purchase and had voted against it only because he considered that
                    part of the bill giving the president temporary power to appoint officials to
                    exercise all military, civil, and judicial powers in the territory to be
                    unconstitutional. He had voted against excluding foreign slave trade in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> because the Constitution prohibited such limitiation until 1808. He
                    had objected to formal mourning because he feared it would establish a precedent
                    without determining who would be eligible in the future for such honor.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>Adams' supporters insisted that his past record, especially his service
                    in Congress in 1807-1808, was proof of his loyalty to the Republican party. At a
                    time when Anglo-American relations were deteriorating, he had held important
                    Senate committee chairmanships, including that of the committee to which the
                    Senate referred President Jefferson's message on the Chesapeake.

                    organize support for him. In July, 1824, Stout called for a series of county
                    conventions which were to select delegates to a state convention which would
                    nominate Jackson.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> This convention met at <placeName>

                    thirteen of the state's fifty-three counties. The editor was certain
                    that such poor attendance would "satisfy every reflecting man as to the

            <p>Jackson's adherents, rather than being discouraged by the seeming lack
                    of interest shown in their candidate, made political capital of it. They tried
                    to create an image of the general as a reluctant candidate, a man above
                    politics, who did not seek office for selfish reasons. As early as 1822, one of
                    his Indiana admirers had written that he would "regret to see the
                    laurels which Jackson has acquired, tarnished" by a political contest,
                    because "such strife does not become him."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> This appearance was enhanced by the printing of a letter from the
                    general dated April 26, 1824, in which he stated that he had been made a
                    candidate "by the people themselves, without any agency of mine; for I
                    wish it not to be forgotten, that I never have solicited office; nor, when

                    </placeName> constitutional convention Jackson "was warmly OPPOSED to
                    the general right of suffrage," wanting to restrict the franchise to
                    property holders. Such action, it was argued, should deprive Jackson of the
                    "title of <hi rend="i">people's</hi> candidate." The
                    editorializing continued, "What! are the poorer class of people, who
                    fight the battles of their country, who pay their hard-earned pittance to
                    support the government, not to be entitled to the privilege of saying who shall

            <p>If there was little evidence from Jackson's political career to use

                    and outlook made him unfit to rule in accord with republican principles. If
                    elected, it was claimed, the general, being "a man of violent and
                    arbitrary principles," would subject the civil to the military power to
                    such an extent that only "Turkey, abject and degraded by

                    ambition and military glory," hoped that the general would lead the
                    nation into a war in which "their devotion would be rewarded with
                    commissions, titles and honors, stars and garters." The implications of

            <p>Closely related to the issue of republican principles were the issues of slavery

                    associated slavery with the attempt being made in the early 1820's to
                    call a state constitutional convention. They claimed that supporters of a
                    convention hoped to introduce slavery into the state.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> This

            <p>The strongest antislavery sentiment in Indiana was found in the eastern part of
                    the state, where Quakers supported Adams. Most newspapers that endorsed the New

            <p>Adams' opponents, finding it difficult to involve him in the slavery

            <p>Other issues in 1824 related to problems viewed as primarily western. While many
                    spokesmen deplored the evils of sectionalism and denied that they supported a
                    candidate merely because he was from the West, they nevertheless expressed
                    concern that the new president be favorably disposed to their particular needs.
                    One writer observed that reasons given for electing a western president,
                    "SO far as they are founded upon geographical jealousies, can have no
                    weight in favour of any candidate." They could especially

                    </placeName> men insisted that their candidate was less sectional than any of
                    the others. One explained, "An inhabitant of the West is …
                    of necessity more national than one of the East or South, because the East and
                    South have united to form the West." While the East was mainly
                    concerned with commercial interests, and the South with agriculture,

                    Westerner, citing his role in the Treaty of Ghent of 1815 as an illustration. It

                    improvements were an integral part of his policy of economic nationalism. While
                    there was no serious discussion in the Indiana press of his total program, at
                    least one paper printed his American System speech in Congress on March 30 and
                    31, 1824, in its entirety;<hi rend="sup">86</hi> and his record as "the

            <p>Adams had the most difficulty with the internal-improvement issue, since many
                    Indiana voters associated him with eastern interests. "What interest
                    has he shown for your roads and canals?" asked one newspaper. <quote rend="blockquote">

                            it not to be feared that in some future treaty to secure some paltry

            <p>Adams' supporters, attempting to show that their candidate favored
                    internal improvements, cited his record in the Senate in 1807-1808. When
                    Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin had made a report on roads and canals,
                    Adams had moved to have it printed and distributed to the people "in

                    contemplated "a <hi rend="i">general system</hi> of internal
                    improvement." He avowed that he still held the same opinions. Although
                    he respected "the purity of intention of those who object, on
                    constitutional grounds, to the exercise of this power," he was pleased
                    to observe such objections "gradually yielding to the paramount

                    would finance the development of a national transportation system. But many
                    westerners had come to regard the development of manufacturing as beneficial in
                    itself. As early as 1820 Governor Jonathan Jennings had observed that income
                    from the state's agricultural produce was declining in proportion to
                    the cost of imported merchandise. The solution to this problem, as he saw it,

                    when Congress again considered the matter, the bill would be passed by a large
                    majority due to additional western votes, since in the meantime Indiana would be

                    volumes on the propriety, the policy, and necessity of affording by law,
                    protection and encouragement to domestic manufactures."<hi rend="sup">96</hi> Advocates of the tariff insisted that the encouragement of
                    manufacturing would not endanger agriculture or commerce, since the interests of
                    all three were identical. Domestic manufacturing, rather than being detrimental
                    to the nation, was the chief pillar of its independence. <placeName>

            <p>The tariff issue presented difficulties for most of the candidates. It was
                    reported that Jackson was in a dilemma over the tariff because "if
                    against it, his strength to the North is gone; if for it, the South will give
                    him up." The South, unable to support Adams or <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> because both favored a protective tariff, could only turn to
                    Crawford, "the only man on the list, who is indisposed to sustain the
                    industry and labor of our country." Jackson, Adams, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> were "known to be friendly and favorable to a discreet and
                    prudent protection of home industry… ." Jackson's
                    supporters were certain that he would not "shrink from the
                    responsibility, or seek for a moment to conceal his opinions; let what
                    consequences come that may, he will not unfurl on this side of the Potomac one
                    flag, another on the South side." But in spite of the difficulties
                    presented by the tariff, the prediction was made that none of the candidates
                    would be much affected regardless of their position on the issue. "The
                    public know that this is a matter of policy, which appertains to Congress, not
                    the President—and is one about which men may honestly and fairly
                    differ… ."<hi rend="sup">108</hi>

            <p>As Indiana voters went to the polls on the first Monday in November, 1824, to
                    express their choices for "the first office in the gift of a free
                    people," few editors were willing to predict the outcome of the
                    election. Editor Stout of the <placeName>

            <p>Toward the end of the, month, election returns began to appear in the press,
                    usually without editorial comment.<hi rend="sup">100</hi> Editors seemed to be
                    taking a wait-and-see attitude. Even when Jackson's victory in the
                    state became apparent, most editors did not believe it significant for
                    determining the outcome of the national election. As Editor Buxton of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Public Leger</hi> noted, "It is rendered pretty certain
                    … that there will be no election by the people."<hi rend="sup">101</hi> Nor was there much excitement in the press when it was
                    announced that Jackson had definitely won the state's five electoral
                        votes.<hi rend="sup">102</hi> Editors were still not willing to claim
                    national victory or admit defeat for their candidates.</p>
            <p>As predicted, the election was decided by the national House of Representatives,
                    where Indiana cast its vote for Jackson, but Adams was elected. Indiana editors
                    apparently felt that once the election went to the House, it was beyond their
                    influence. They ceased either to praise or condemn candidates and merely
                    reported what news they could glean from eastern papers. The editor of the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi>, a Jackson man, was somewhat more expressive,

                    console themselves for the disappointment, under the firm conviction, that the

                        comment,<hi rend="sup">106</hi> but the editor of the Centreville <hi rend="i">Western Emporium</hi> observed that the address compared favorably
                    with those of Adams' predecessors and that is was "calculated
                    to call forth the applause of every American, and even excite the wonder of
                    Europe." The measures it proposed, if followed, would "destroy
                    the collisions produced by party spirit, and ensure harmony at home and peace
                        abroad."<hi rend="sup">107</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Distrust and dislike of "party spirit" characterized most of
                    the comments made in the press about the election. Editors emphasized that this
                    was a time for national unity, and that there was "no spectacle more
                    grand—no scene more imposing—no circumstance more
                    gratifying to an American citizen, and lover of our republican
                    institutions" than when the representatives in Congress
                    "selected and proclaimed the first officer of the Union-there was no
                    excitement, no impression of disappointment, but all appeared cheerfully to
                    acquiesce, when the Speaker declared JOHN QUINCY ADAMS to be duly elected
                    President… ."<hi rend="sup">108</hi> One writer observed
                    that the "presidential question has been long enough at rest for party
                    spirit to subside and be at rest also, and the crisis makes a magnanimous appeal
                    to the patriotism of all parties." Pleading that all personal
                    disappointment and resentment should be sacrificed "to the good of the
                    public," this writer called upon all Americans to follow the
                    "noble example" of the "dignified deportment of
                    Congress" and "leave party so far in the rear, that she may
                    never more be able to rear her hideous head in the councils of
                        republicanism."<hi rend="sup">109</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But party strife was not forgotten. It was announced in March, 1825, that Jackson
                    woud be a candidate for the presidency in 1828. One editor advised friends of
                    the general to "exercise forbearance, and test Mr. ADAMs'
                    first administration, before they enter the General for the second heat, lest
                    they might have sufficient cause to repent it." He was certain that
                    "the official services of Mr. ADAMS, as President, will be so
                    completely identified with republicanism and strict honesty, that there will be
                    little or no cause of complaint, <list type="footnotes">

                    voters. He reprinted an article which lamented "that the wishes of
                    eighty-seven members of Congress should defeat the will of millions."
                    Adams was a "minority candidate," and "the voice of a
                    majority of the nation has been disregarded—defied. The people,
                    particularly in the west, have not only been misrepresented, but the spirit of
                    the constitution has been violated." Adams' victory was only
                    "a temporary triumph achieved at the expense of both principle and
                    consistency," and whether it would "prove advantageous to the
                    victors, is a question which must and will be decided by the American people at
                    the next election." Jackson's followers claimed that they had
                    "succeeded at the late election, in prostrating the caucus
                    system." Their next objective was to "break the chain of
                    cabinet succession, and to put a period to the rule of a minority."<hi rend="sup">112</hi> Thus the groundwork was being laid for the campaign of

            <p>Indiana editors had championed their candidates and presented what they

            <p>One commentator has observed that "in quantity, as well as in their
                    influence on the life of the backwoods communities," newspapers
                    "were the most important literary product throughout the pioneer
                    period. Only leaders who were adept in the art of impassioned oratory could
                    rival the editor of a weekly gazette in power to shape the popular will. The
                    editor and printer, by his knowledge of language and the mysteries of his craft,
                    rose to the dignity of an oracle."115 But in the early 1820's,
                    while Indiana editors did reflect the political spectrum, they had not
                    sufficiently perfected their voices to affect the outcome of a national election
                    in the state.</p>

                    "The Dawning World of Claude Bowers," edited by Geoffrey T.
                    Blodgett. The article included two letters from Bowers, then a student at <placeName>

                    seven additional letters from Bowers to Everett, written between September,
                    1896, and July, 1897. This unusual correspondence is interesting because in
                    Bowers' case it describes "the youth who is father of the
                        man"<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and because it pictures education,

                    disclose remarkable ability, learning, and perception for a high school boy of

                        <p>It has not been so very long since there appeared in one of our
                                    leading magazines a series of articles by the learned Dr Rice,
                                    upon the American public school system, in one of which, he says
                                    that the schools of Boston, Philadelphia and Indianapolis stand
                                    at the head.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                        <p>We are especially proud of our High School department. We do not
                                    think it surpassed by any other in the land. It is
                                    equal—more than equal—to the average
                                    college of the south or west. Our faculty numbers twenty, and
                                    there are twelve hundred students enrolled. We teach five
                                    languages, most all of the sciences, and mathematics as high as
                                    surveying. Our English course is generally considered extensive
                                    and most through.</p>

                              <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In this transcription
                                        Bowers' letters were reproduced from Xerox copies
                                        of the written originals. Every effort has been made to
                                        retain the author's capitalization and punctuation.
                                        Bowers admitted to a "well-deserved reputation of
                                        being a dreadfully poor speller"; thus, his many
                                        mistakes have neither been corrected nor indicated by a [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]. Minor changes have been made in the
                                        spacing of headings, salutations, and closings; but the
                                        punctuation originally used in these portions of the letters
                                        has been retained. Underscored words have been italicized
                                        and superior letters brought down to the line. Where words
                                        have been marked over, that version has been selected which
                                        was apparently Bowers' later choice. Obviously
                                        unintentional repetitions have been omitted. In doubtful or
                                        marginal situations modern practice has determined paragraph
                                        breaks and the use of question or exclamation marks.
                                        Identification of places and persons was facilitated by

                        <p>Now the Feb '98 class, for the purpose of raiseing funds
                                    for the purpose of purchaseing for our school some work of art,
                                    has determined upon the publication of a magazine of excellent
                                    literature, from the pens of truelly great men—<hi rend="i">and from them alone.</hi> It will be no school-boy
                                    scrap book. In fact, we are absolutely certain of at least five
                                    thousand readers, not at all connected with any school life. It
                                    will be published monthly. In size it will resemble
                                    "Harpers" with the advertisements omitted.</p>
                        <p>During the last month alone, we have received assurances of
                                    articles from two U.S. Senators, a great leader in the English
                                    parliament, four celebrated orators, two distinguished jurists,
                                    three eminent writers, one great educator, one foreign minister,
                                    and two noted Divines. M. [Rouiers?] will also write for us.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                                    your oratory and scholarship-and that is sufficient. They all
                                    unite in the sentiment that you are worthy of the glorious name
                                    you bear. This is all sincere—it is plain western
                                    frankness.</p>
                        <p>Now we want an article from you, upon any subject, of any length
                                    not less than what would occupy four pages of

                                    <salute>Dr Wm Everett,<lb/> Dear Friend:-</salute>
                                </opener>
                        <p>Your letter of Oct-25, has been received with gratitude. I can
                                    readily beleive that I may have allowed my boyish enthusiasm to
                                    overthrow even a boys crude judgment.</p>
                        <p>However your mention of the mistake in name seems to savor
                                    slightly of a belief that I acted a hypocrite in my expression
                                    of admiration for your oratory. In common justice to myself, I
                                    must insist that there was absolutely nothing of hypocracy in
                                    the spirit which prompted my note. I <hi rend="i">did</hi>
                                    admire your speeches and I admired them <hi rend="i">before</hi>
                                    I ever heard your name—, would have admired them had
                                    I <hi rend="i">never</hi> heard your name.</p>
                        <p>I am but a boy as you say—and I suspect, a very
                                    ordinary one. In fact, considering my poor store of knowledge, I
                                    should feel very much discouraged indeed, were I any thing other
                                    than a boy.</p>
                        <p>I am always exceedingly grateful for any criticism from any
                                    person older than myself, and when it comes from one of your
                                    great expierence with boys, it is doubly valuable to me. I
                                    assure you that no language by way of criticism could under any
                                    circumstance make me mad.</p>
                        <p>I have often wondered why it was that friends capable of passing
                                    judgment are so very slow in doing so when they must know that
                                    by so doing they are bestowing upon their needy friend the
                                    greatest favor.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps my letter tinged of egotism, and maybe I seemed a little
                                    forward. Well, I am not situated as are many boys. I am an
                                    orphant without family or financial influence, and I feel that
                                    what-ever success I may here-after attain to, must <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-063-3-037"/> be due directly to my own efforts.
                                    Thus I have been thrown out into the world—been made
                                    to touch elbows with the commons, and I may have unconsciously
                                    taken on some of their airs of boldness and rudeness. Hence
                                    there is nothing on earth that I need so much as some sternly
                                    just, yet friendly man of learning to "assume the
                                    pedagogue over me" and point out the points where-in I
                                    fail and their remedy.</p>
                        <p>I court your criticism in the spirit of one who would progress.
                                    If I could only make you understand the spirit in which I write
                                    this, I am quite sure that you would think differently of me.</p>
                        <p>I am only seven-teen years old and have several years of constant
                                    study yet before me, and I want to make the very best use of my
                                    time during those years.</p>
                        <p>My hopes are that I may one day study for the Bar. In the
                                    mean-while I wish to fit my-self by the study of language for
                                    that oratory which is so potent at the Bar and on the hustings.
                                    I love poetry, history, oratory and biography. Am I taking the
                                    right course?</p>
                        <p>Now please excuse me if I have written too much about myself. But
                                    the tone of your letter was at once so friendly and so just that
                                    I, in turn, have attempted to be frank and open.</p>
                        <p>Once more I court your criticism—it is my greatest
                                    need. The critic is my best friend. I would also like any advise
                                    as to study.</p>

                                </opener>
                        <p>Your kind and instructive letter of Nov. 14, has been read with
                                    real pleasure, not unmingled with a little humiliation. I made
                                    several serious mistakes which I, my-self might have noticed,
                                    had I not written in such haste. I have the well-deserved
                                    reputation of being a dreadfully poor speller, but this fault
                                    never before came home to me so forcibly and effectually as in
                                    your letter. The grammatical mistakes were entirely the result
                                    of heedlessness. The incorrectness <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-063-3-038"/> and inelegance of my diction was
                                    probably due to a limited vocabulary, and an indiscriminating
                                    selection which I know was absolutely inexcusable. But the
                                    letter has surely wrought a revolution in me—one
                                    which I am quite certain will eventually help me vastly.</p>
                        <p>I think I shall adopt the Choatean method of increasing and
                                    perfecting my vocabulary by a constant study of the dictionary
                                    and of synonyms.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>However you make two mistakes, which for the sake of the school,
                                    I wish to correct. Instead of being a member of the highest
                                    class in the school, there are two classes higher yet than mine.
                                    I graduate in Feb. '98. And in place of being the
                                    leading member of my class, I consider myself by far the most
                                    humble. So please do not hold me as a good type of the products
                                    of the schools of this city.</p>
                        <p>I acknowledge that some eminent orators lead me into making
                                    several errors. The word "hustings", I first

                                    and you have pointed out the result.</p>
                        <p>I suppose that most boys of my age have fallen into the error of
                                    admiring the gaudy in literature. Try as I may, I cannot bring
                                    myself to admire the orations of Burke and the younger Pitt.
                                    Chatham, Fox, and Erskine are my favorites among the English.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> And yet in Dr Browns charming biography
                                    of Choate, I have read that eminent man's opinion of
                                    the English orators, in which he places Burke far above all the
                                    others combined.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Well I have
                                    read–studied t[hrough] many of Burke's
                                    speeches, and I can find nothing especially admirable but the
                                    severity of his logic, the purity of his diction, and his
                                    fullness and fairness of treatment. Now Choate was a great
                                    orator and master of English; I am an ordinary boy who can not
                                    even spell correctly. Choate was educated up to the high-water
                                    mark of appreciation; I am not. Then what is there in an oration
                                    that I fail to find, or finding, fail to appreciate?</p>
                        <p>I want to first educate myself up to point of appreciation before
                                    I begin on Cicero and the Greeks.</p>
                        <p>In your letter you advised me to make everything I say or write,
                                    distinctly my own. This has been my intention. I very seldom
                                    memorize any-selections from the orations I read. I try to pick
                                    them to pieces so as to get the orators line of reasoning and
                                    method of proceeding. In this way I can readily determine which
                                    is logic, which rhetoric, and their relations. I may be
                                    "on the wrong track". I have never been
                                    advised upon that subject.</p>
                        <p>I wish I could express to you my thanks for the good you have
                                    done me. You have stirred me up and brought me face to face with
                                    myself. You know it is but natural for a boy to be easily
                                    contented with however little he may know. His boy friends have
                                    a sort of boyish respect for him, and you know a true boys
                                    respect is always apparent. And so <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>For your valuable letter of Dec. 3, I am deeply indebted to you.
                                    It was for just such kind of advise for which I had long been
                                    looking and it was certainly delightful to find it addressed
                                    directly to me. You express the fear that in my study of
                                    language, I am confining myself too exclusively to oratory and
                                    not enough to poetry and history. I suspect that you are about
                                    right. But on my part it has been an unconscious mistake, and
                                    not one reached by any false process of reasoning. I am very
                                    fond of poetry of the imaginative kind. Although no beleiver in
                                    the doctrines for which Shelly stands, I greatly admire his
                                    poetry for its magnificient imagery. I realily love to read

                                    can't appreciate him now as I should like, I find some

                                    Erskine. As to Dante, I can quote you the first two lines of his

                                    dance with life. Every one of his short chapters abounds in such

                                    read biographies of most of the orators, that debating societies
                                    are truly important organizations for boys. A friend and myself
                                    have for some time been attempting to organize a club, but the
                                    boys here take no interest in such things at all, and we have
                                    been unsuccessful. One of my heroes is Seargant S.

                                    has a Senatorial name. I am a member of the Senate but it wastes

                                    most humorous passage of all, the one in which you ask if I ever
                                    laugh. Well among my friends here, I am usually as gay as the
                                    gayest, but shut up in a room by myself, my thoughts invariably
                                    run in a serious channel in as far as a boy can be truly
                                    serious. But you know a persons environments has much to do with
                                    his temperment, and mine have not always been of the gayest

                                    grate rather harshly upon Mr. Williams nerves, and, after
                                    bearing it a few times, he temporarily forgot Wall and Lombard

                                    thundered out the declaration:-"Sir, that's
                                    not applause, that's interruption". A
                                    gentleman siting by me explained the unusual conduct of the
                                    speaker by informing me that "Williams was from Mass.
                                    anyway" And so I have ever since thought it best to
                                    maintain a very serious and rigid deportment in all
                                    communications with a man from Mass. But I appreciate to the
                                    fullest extent, the criticism so kindly offered.</p>
                        <p>But please do not think that I have such gloomy cast of mind, as
                                    to dislike the fire, energy, vividness, dashing freedom and
                                    fresh purity of Sir. Walter Scotts poetry. He is one of my
                                    favorite poets and I have memorized more from Sir. Walter, than
                                    from any other. But I am not so very fond of his
                                    prose—don't like his characters at all, as
                                    they all seem so unreal like dreams, tinsoldiers, phantoms. And
                                    then the novels are all so much the same thing in plot.</p>
                        <p>No, from my knowledge of boy's reading, we are not
                                    enthusiastic readers of the great English
                                    novelist—Dickens—and I must frankly
                                    acknowledge that I have never read one of his novels entirely
                                    through. If you will not wax sarcastic over the term, I suppose
                                    I could call my favorite novel the philosophic-realistic such as
                                    are written by Eliot, Hugo, Hawthorn and the great Russian

                                    read, possessing, as it does, the wonderful power to stimulate
                                    thought and feeling—yes and controversy. Among a
                                    particular class of boys I find that Hugo is a prime favorite,
                                    in spite of all this unfavorable criticism which is heaped upon
                                    it from the moral stand-point. Do you think it a healthy

                                    other national histories through general works? I am not very
                                    fond of military history, prefering much, to trace out the
                                    development in governments through evolutions in the character
                                    of the peoples, or through revolutions their causes and results.
                                    In a general way I have read history rather extensively, but
                                    with no particular purpose in view, other than learning the
                                    facts for their own sake. Now for the study of governmental
                                    history are there any special works which you would reccommend?
                                    I ask this because a few boys and girls have organized a club
                                    for that purpose, which begins work next month. In the meanwhile
                                    we are to get all the suggestions possible. I have been told
                                    that boys should not read history in this way in connection with
                                    civics as the comparisons between past and present might not
                                    leave our minds in the most happy and contented state, but I
                                    don't beleive in any such doctrine at all. In a

                                    that the growing generation should be perfectly acquainted with
                                    social and political conditions, however rotten they may be.
                                    Things usually grow bad by slow degrees, and unless we who are
                                    to be the future men of America, have the distinction drawn
                                    between the good and bad early in life, we will necessarily
                                    accept things as they are upon reaching our manhood, as matter
                                    of fact only. And so, it would take but a few generations in
                                    this way, to bring about an entirely new sentiment in
                                    government. Why not draw comparisons as we go along? If as Henry

                                    our farmers is passing from their hands, leaving them to the

                                    boy feel alarmed at the prospects? I have been told in the
                                    schools that we should not allow our minds to dwell for an
                                    instant upon such subjects, but I don't beleive it. And
                                    since they won't tolerate any thing of the kind in

                                    knowledge that what-ever may be lacking in prudence, is at least

                                    Joaquin Miller has come and gone after a very successful
                                    engagement here. James Whitcomb Riley introduced him and
                                    although I very seldom read any of Rileys poems, and never then,
                                    with admiration, the meeting between the two celebrated poets
                                    was to me quite interesting and unique. They are great friends
                                    and though they have many things in common, even to a bad
                                    reputation, they are the direct opposites to all out-ward
                                    appearance. Riley dresses always in the height of fashion, and

                                    lovable in repose. His great massy hair and heavy beard, now
                                    well tinged with grey, imparts to him, a patriarchal air,
                                    inviting confidence, and his kindly blue eyes, which dreamy and
                                    soulful seem resting ever upon something afar off, give an added
                                    force to the invitation. His voice is mellow and musical. In his
                                    room at the hotel, he had ever before him, incased in velvet, an
                                    image of his beautiful daughter Juanita who he says is the

                                    thing I am quite sure—if as Emerson says

                                    to the world. He spoke of his friend—and yours I

                                    gives a great spreadout for his friend the politician. Irish you
                                    know, wears no tie. Well Miller out-does him, in that he wears
                                    no collar. Being a native of this state, the poet while here was
                                    invited to visit and if possible address the Legislature. Upon
                                    my presenting him with the Leut. Governor's note, he
                                    turned to Wagner his Secretary and with a look of real fright
                                    upon his face, placed his hand on his bare neck and
                                    exclaimed—"Now what <hi rend="i">will</hi> I

                                    heard in this city for some time and yet the granduer consisted
                                    wholly in the simplicity—, simplicity of language,
                                    simplicity of sentiment and delivery. He spoke of nature with

                                    reminded me of Whitman. Now I do not claim to understand Whitman
                                    but I have read some of his "Leaves of Grass"
                                    which I truly admire. They seem to cut the imagination loose and
                                    stir the mind to thought.</p>

                                    given too much credit which is bad, and many prizes and books
                                    which is good. Among the latter, I had given me by Mr. Fishback
                                    the lawyer and ex. pardner of Harrisons, a splendid little book
                                    on "The Principles of Argumentation" by Prof.

                                    I think his diction simply wonderful, and would delight in the
                                    reading of his works were I not constantly falling into the
                                    sloughs of classical allusion which necessitates frequent visits

                                    myself? I had thought some of reading it once over throughly,
                                    acquainting myself perfectly with the allusions and unusual
                                    phrases, and then write it out in my own language, retaining the
                                    sentiment as nearly as possible. This is in fact a tremendous
                                    job but such work as that has been of great benefit to me in the

                        <p>I have recently been reading a biography of Danton the
                                    much-cursed leader of the Parisian mob, and have come to the
                                    conclusion that of all the great characters of history, there
                                    are but few names, that can out-shine in love for humanity, and
                                    in ultimate benefit to humanity the name of Geo F Danton.
                                    Judgeing from his public actions, I should think that he was a
                                    great-minded, golden-hearted man—a victim of
                                    circumstances. I think if that some Danton should rise up in
                                    Russia today and purge her misery with the blood of some of her
                                    tyrants, she, in common with all the world would be the better

                        <p>I wish to submit to you a plan which a friend of mine in the law
                                    school here and myself intend to work up, this summer if
                                    possible. We who are shut up within the four walls of a school
                                    building, with boys and girls who are generally in excellent
                                    circumstance, financially and socially, are very much dulled by
                                    books alone and sadly narrowed in understanding. We are all very
                                    much alike, have the same point of view, the same character of
                                    mind, the same passions and prejudices. My plan is to form a <hi rend="i">large</hi> debating club composed almost wholly of
                                    laborers of all discriptions between the ages of 17 and 25. We
                                    will get a large room down town, and hold weekly meetings,
                                    discussing all manner of passing political and social questions.
                                    Now most of these laborers will be naturally nerved against
                                    conviction by prejudice, and to overcome this stubborn
                                    prejudice, it seems to me would be the best possible exercise.
                                    In this way I would be brought into contact with another world,
                                    would form new acquaintances, and hear the expressions of new
                                    veiws. Do you think a<hi rend="sup">33</hi> plan like this would

                                    </placeName> attended the fight and visited both contenders.
                                    Since Ingalls had developed a trenchant literary style and
                                    frequently wrote for newspapers and periodicals, he may have
                                    written up the fight and thus incurred Bowers' wrath.

            <p>During the editing of the correspondence from Claude G. Bowers to William
                    Everett, Miss Jean Grubb, director of publications at Shortridge High School,
                    provided the editors of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> with a
                    photostatic copy of the letter reproduced below. Written by Bowers in 1948 to J.
                    W. Hadley, principal of Shortridge, the letter amplifies information found in
                    the earlier Bowers-Everett correspondence, provides further descriptions of
                    Shortridge and its illustrious alumnus, and illustrates that Bowers remained
                    "a dreadfully poor speller" throughout his life. The occasion
                    for the letter was the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of <hi rend="i">The Daily Echo</hi>, the high school newspaper. Bowers, who was serving as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> ambassador to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1948, was unable to attend; but his letter indicates a
                    continuing interest in his high school alma mater and his gratitude for the
                    education he received there. Although Bowers throughout the letter refers to his
                    days at Shortridge, the <placeName>

                    Bowers' graduation. Grateful acknowledgement is made to Shortridge High

            <p>The loss of popularity suffered by the Democrats as a result of the Panic of 1837
                    was an obvious advantage for the Whig party in the presidential campaign of
                    1840. A combination of heterogeneous groups organized in opposition to
                    Jacksonian Democracy, the Whigs were confronted with the necessity of selecting
                    a candidate who could win the support of the diverse groups within the party.

                    </placeName> addressed a letter to Prentice in which he suggested that,
                    regardless of his inclination, he should again be forced into the presidential
                    arena. "It is right," he wrote, "that I should put

                    reason to believe that he was favored by a majority of the Whigs throughout the

            <p>Early in January, 1839, Prentice already had begun to exercise extreme caution in
                    his comments concerning the leading Whig contenders for the nomination. He
                    informed his readers that because he had been among the first to urge the
                    selection of a candidate by a national convention, he was reluctant to print
                    anything about the prospective candidates.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> A few days later
                    he noted, "We perceive, that a writer in the <hi rend="i">

                    such disagreeable discussions."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The next day,
                    however, following a comment on the scheduled date of the national convention,
                    he wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Immediately after Harrison's nomination and throughout the month of
                    January, Prentice supported the Whig candidate with enthusiasm. He described
                    Harrison as a man of integrity who could be trusted to introduce economy into
                    the administration of public affairs. The editor emphasized that the
                    "honest and gallant old farmer and hero" of North Bend had
                    pledged himself not to be a candidate for a second term; thus, without a motive
                    for abusing his power or patronage he should work to reform the evils under
                    which the American people had suffered for years. Prentice promised to dedicate
                    all his powers to the interest of the "cause of the Whigs and the
                        Constitution."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    hard cider, and coonskin cap became the emblems of a party destined for victory.
                    Huge log cabins with barrels of hard cider nearby were erected in cities and
                    towns across the country. Smaller cabins were constructed on wagons and carts
                    and pulled in the great torchlight processions and parades of the enthusiastic
                    Whigs. Pictures and cartoons of Harrison at the door of a log cabin home and
                    transparencies depicting similar scenes were a part of every great procession.</p>

                    full day was devoted to the erection of a log cabin near Horn's Coffee
                    House which became the site of all future Whig meetings. A great barbecue for

                    paragraphs mentioning events related to the Whigs in various parts of America.
                    Usually these paragraphs emphasized incidents denoting success for the party.
                    Prentice was striving for a psychological effect: if you want to be on the
                    bandwagon with the victors, support the Whigs. The editor sometimes revealed his
                    wit and humor as he sought to convey deeper political concepts. One such
                    paragraph read: " ‘Come boys', said General
                    Harrison to his army of 2000, ‘let's take <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>

                    revenue’. <hi rend="i">It was taken.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Nevertheless, the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> refrained from printing a
                    campaign slogan or cartoon; and the seven-verse "Log Cabin
                    Song" and "Mr. <placeName>

                    </placeName> Buren's Farewell to the Palace" were the only
                    campaign poems to appear in the Journal.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> editorial style in 1840 probably resulted from a
                    combination of circumstances. Despite his commitment to support the candidate of
                    the national convention, Prentice was doubtless personally disappointed that his
                    friend <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> had not received the honor. He may also have disliked using the
                    "rhyme without reason" tactics of his fellow editors; and
                    since the convention had failed to adopt a platform, he had no
                    "specific" program to defend. Prentice probably concentrated
                    on brief editorial paragraphs rather than lengthy articles as the medium which
                    best represented his own talent and as the best possible course under the
                    circumstances.</p>
            <p>In their effort to win the election, the Whigs throughout the country sought the
                    vote of various minority groups.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, likewise, appealed directly to people of German origin and to
                    those of Roman Catholic faith. Repeated announcements of political meetings for
                    the Germans indicated that Whig candidates would address the group and, in many
                    cases, that speeches would be delivered in both English and German.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Prentice also defended a <placeName>

                    naturalized citizens who desired to vote. He explained that the objective was to
                    procure sufficient evidence so that all those eligible were guaranteed the right
                    to vote.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> In an appeal to the Catholics Prentice quoted the

                    </placeName>: Central Publishing Company, Inc., 1966. Pp. xv, 399.
                    Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. $5.95.)</head>
            <p>Using the available collections of source materials and interviewing numerous
                    political insiders of the 1930's and 1940's, most of all Frank
                    M. McHale, Blake has written a most readable biography of Paul V. McNutt. The
                    volume covers McNutt's career as Indiana University law school dean; as
                    state and national commander of the American Legion; as Indiana's
                    governor from 1933 to 1937; as Philippine high commissioner from 1937 to 1939
                    and again from 1945 to 1947, during the Philippine transition from commonwealth
                    to national independence; as head of the Federal Security Agency from 1939 to
                    1945; and as director of the Office of Community War Services and as chairman of
                    the important War Manpower Commission during World War II. McNutt emerges,
                    truthfully, as one of the ablest of the wartime administrators, along with Harry
                    Hopkins, James F. Byrnes, and Donald M. Nelson.</p>
            <p>This biography is distinctly favorable to McNutt without being downright
                    eulogistic. Somewhat reminiscent of nineteenth-century biographies, it gives
                    copious quotations from letters to McNutt and editorial comment about him.
                    Curiously enough, unlike the old style biographies, there are relatively few
                    quotations from the letters and speeches of McNutt himself.</p>
            <p>McNutt's story is essentially one of frustration. With all his ability,
                    administrative competence, oratory, good looks, charisma (to a degree), and
                    "availabilty," McNutt never achieved the opportunity he craved
                    to be nominated for president or vice president. The giant figure of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> D. Roosevelt forever stood in his way. Roosevelt used
                    McNutt's administrative abilities, but he played a cat-and-mouse game
                    with him and boxed him in politically. New Deal insiders suspected that McNutt
                    was not a "real" liberal, and Roosevelt and James A. Farley
                    never forgave the Hoosier's failure to support FDR at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> convention of 1932.</p>
            <p>The author devotes too little attention to this convention, for it was the
                    turning point in McNutt's career. On the other hand, he devotes too
                    much attention to McNutt's presidential candidacy in 1940 and to his
                    dramatic withdrawal from the vice-presidential race at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> convention that year, for these activities constituted mere tour de
                    force. Because Roosevelt and his cohorts dominated the situation in 1940, McNutt
                    stood no chance of either the presidential or vice-presidential nomination,
                    whether Roosevelt ran for a third term or not. Blake implicitly provides the
                    evidence for this conclusion, but he shrinks from making it explicit.</p>
            <p>McNutt and his advisers, in 1932 and 1940, were victims of Indiana's
                    political mores, which, for a variety of reasons deeply rooted in
                    Indiana's history, exaggerated sheer political organization and
                    maneuver and underestimated national opinion and the mass media. There is irony
                    here. The very year that saw the collapse of McNutt's presidential and
                    vice-presidential "booms" also saw Wendell Willkie, another
                        <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-063-3-072"/> Hoosier, win the Republican
                    presidential nomination by turning his back on Indiana political traditions, the
                    old-fashioned ways in politics, and exploiting the new ways of the mass media.</p>
            <p>Although McNutt matured with time and experience, impressions of the earlier man
                    persisted. He was thought to be the perennial
                    "big-man-on-campus" type, one who gathered honors as mere
                    personal trophies. As late as 1930 admirers were writing him that they were
                    confident he would become a "Big Shot." A widespread belief
                    that McNutt at bottom was a chauvinist and a jingo would not down. McNutt rarely
                    espoused an unpopular cause or flew in the face of conventional wisdom. This is
                    not unusual in politicians, but it is unusual in politicians of
                    McNutt's intelligence, whether they be liberals or conservatives.</p>
            <p>A close reading of this biography reveals that McNutt was not as cold or as
                    arrogant a person as many supposed. Nevertheless, it is a pity that a man of his
                    large gifts was so bereft, at least in his public "image," of
                    the humility and compassion of a John Worth Kern, of the folksy and salty wit of
                    a Thomas Riley Marshall, of the impish maverick qualities of a Wendell Willkie.</p>

            <p>Some of the most provocative recent economic history has been in the areas of
                    transportation and land resources. The Grain Trade in the Old Northwest
                    represents a contribution to this growing historiography. John Clark
                    exhaustively examines the fluctuating grain market for the antebellum period in
                    the Old Northwest. He traces the shift from the dominance of the
                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> system, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the southern markets to the East-West axis with the evolution
                    of canals and railroads.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the conclusions of Harry Scheiber and others, Clark believes that
                    the early railroad development in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana gave these states a competitive marketing advantage
                    over <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Though Clark abstains from specifically challenging the
                    econometricians (nowhere is there evidence in his bibliography that he utilized
                    the studies of Robert Fogel and other practioners of econometrics), his findings
                    are in direct antithesis to theirs. According to Clark, the railroads, instead
                    of producing a drain on the economy, "provided the essential catalytic
                    action for growth" (p. 264). In agreement with Scheiber's
                    incisive study of internal improvements in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Clark argues that the railroads had a revolutionary economic
                    impact, although he refines Scheiber's conclusions by suggesting that
                    the "lake route continued to dominate" through the
                    1880's (p. 287).</p>
            <p>In some respects this is a model monograph, thoroughly researched, systematically
                    organized, and tightly written; Clark has rigidly defined his subject. At times
                    the reader feels that his narrative is the direct transposition of line graphs
                    to words. Most readers who have <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-063-3-073"/> labored in
                    antebellum agriculture and internal improvements will have empathy for the
                    author's strict adherence to the confines of his research boundaries.
                    Just as many may wonder if Clark's study would not have been enhanced
                    by including more information on land use patterns, state economic policy, and
                    altering shifts in demography.</p>

                    </placeName>. These two cities, so closely united that <placeName>

                    </placeName> people refer to them as one community, Neenah-Menasha, lie on both
                    sides of the two channels through which <geogName>Lake Winnebago</geogName>
                    enters into the north-flowing <geogName>Fox River</geogName>.</p>
            <p>Beginning with the founding of the villages in the 1840's, the author
                    traces their growth to the time when each was incorporated: Neenah in 1873,
                    Menasha in 1874. Within these chronological boundaries the author recounts the
                    struggle for internal waterway improvements, roads, railroads, and lake
                    transportation; the fever of land speculation; the rise of mercantile
                    enterprises, industrial plants, and banking; the development of newspapers,
                    churches, schools, and urban services; the controversies over temperance and
                    slavery; the characteristics of the population; and the rivalry which prevented
                    the consolidation of the two villages.</p>
            <p>From frontier settlements to commercial towns and then to industrial cities,
                    Neenah and Menasha followed much the same pattern as did other cities of the
                    Middle West. During the village period their economic growth rested largely upon
                    the wheat brought from the surrounding countryside to supply the flour milling
                    industry and upon the lumber from the forests for the woodworking industry. At
                    the opening of the decade of the 1870's their famed paper industry was
                    still in the future.</p>
            <p>The author refutes the common assumption that the composition of the population
                    was largely foreign. Of the 1,412 residents in the two villages in 1850 only 30
                    per cent were foreign born. Sixty-one per cent of the latter came from the
                    British Isles, with the largest number coming from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>. In 1870 the population of the two villages totaled 5,139. The
                    native born outnumbered the foreign born two to one, with the Germans as the
                    largest segment.</p>
            <p>The volume represents extensive research in the manuscript federal census returns
                    in the society's library, local official records, newspapers, and local
                    histories. It is well documented and includes apt illustrations, an excellent
                    bibliographic essay, and a good index. The book is a real contribution to an

            <p>Although the colonial period of American history is receiving increasing
                    attention from interested scholars, there has been, and still is, a paucity of
                    books of readings—-collections of significant articles, essays,
                    portions of monographs, and primary materials—which may be used
                    profitably as collateral reading in courses treating this area of American
                    history. Such collections, if they are reasonably thematically integrated and
                    edited with an eye to scholarly quality, may enhance the student's
                    interest in, and understanding of, colonial history.</p>
            <p>Colbourn's volume is welcome not only because it meets a definite need
                    but because of its generally high quality of content, organization, and
                    editorial commentary. The book is divided into ten sections, each containing
                    several selections focusing on a significant aspect of early American history.
                    Excellent annotated bibliographies with suggestions for further reading conclude
                    each section. It is, of course, impossible to deal with every facet of the
                    colonial period in a book of this sort, but Colbourn has chosen his emphases
                    well.</p>
            <p>The arrangement of the sections is both chronological and topical, moving from
                    the earliest era of English exploration and colonization to the Confederation
                    period and the ratification of the Constitution. Problems of early exploration
                    and colonization; the development of colonial religion, society, and education;
                    and internal and imperial aspects of colonial politics and economics are treated
                    topically, but in a context that carries the student through the colonial period
                    to the Revolution and its aftermath.</p>
            <p>Especially illuminating are the sections on "Colonial Society,"
                    "The Road to Union," and "Mercantilism in Colonial
                    America." Here, Colbourn achieves an admirable balance between fresh,
                    scholarly, secondary accounts and relevant primary materials. Also useful in
                    introducing the student to internal colonial problems is the section on
                    "Insurrection and Division," which deals with Bacon's
                    Rebellion, the Paxton Boys, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> Regulators.</p>
            <p>If a criticism is to be made, it is perhaps that the two sections on the American
                    Revolution give no notice to the current Neo-Whig interpretation ably argued by
                    Edmund S. Morgan, Jack P. Greene, Bernard Bailyn, and others. Space limitations
                    may also have decided the relatively sparse treatment (four short essays) of the
                    Confederation and Constitution periods. This cavil, however, does not lessen the
                    importance or usefulness of Colbourn's book. It is not intended, as the
                    author states in his Preface, as a complete compendium of contemporary and
                    subsequent literature on the colonial period but as a lively, provocative
                    introduction. As such, and used wisely, The Colonial Expehence will fulfill its
                    purpose well.</p>

            <p>Baxter's account of Daniel Webster's career as a lawyer before
                    the Supreme Court of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is an important contribution to an often neglected aspect of the
                    development of constitutional law. Aside from the group studies by Clyde Jacobs,
                    Benjamin Twiss, and Arnold Paul of late nineteenth-century lawyers, there has
                    been a dearth of writing concerning the impact of counsel on Supreme Court
                    decisions and doctrines. As a participant in many of the significant
                    constitutional cases before the Marshall and Taney courts, Webster is an obvious
                    focal point of interest. Baxter has examined Webster's role
                    comprehensively, and with a sophisticated awareness of the political, economic,
                    and social setting and ramifications of constitutional controversies.</p>
            <p>Webster's adulation of judicial power, his distrust of legislatures (how
                    paradoxical for someone who called himself a "Whig" and who
                    has been honored as one of the "six greatest senators"!), and
                    his abiding concern for the protection of property rights, summarize the working
                    principles of most of his great constitutional arguments before the Supreme
                    Court. Indeed the <hi rend="i">proper</hi> protection of property and economic
                    growth were the great issues of political economy that spilled over into the
                    courts. But it is unclear whether Webster fully appreciated that the tension was
                    minimal between those, like himself, who emphasized the stability and order to
                    be derived from a legal system and those who looked to the dynamic quality of
                    law to release creative human energy and to stimulate economic growth. The
                    latter, such as Webster's "new bridge" opponents in
                    the <geogName>Charles River</geogName> Bridge Case, certainly were not hostile
                    to property; the difference boiled down to which view would best encourage
                    investment—that key to the prosperity, or
                    "happiness," which so preoccupied the market-oriented
                    mentality of bustling, bourgeois America.</p>
            <p>Webster's was not necessarily a creative, inventive mind. It may be
                    suggested that his <hi rend="i">forte</hi> was the ability to synthesize
                    available, received doctrines and to present them in an effective, often
                    dramatic manner. He functioned in what has been labeled the
                    "lawyers' golden age of public leadership," and his
                    task was to formulate and advocate the legal sanction for certain interest
                    groups. This he did with unusual success until the
                    1830's—that is, during the chief justiceship of John
                    Marshall. After the latter's death Webster found the Taney Court less
                    receptive toward his views and, with others, lamented the passing of the
                    "old race of judges." Unlike his fictional re-creation,
                    Webster had his problems with "devils."</p>
            <p>In any event there is no need to dispute Baxter's well-substantiated
                    conclusions. As a participant in major constitutional and legal controversies,
                    Webster significantly contributed to the rationalization for national power and
                    labored to exalt the role of the federal judiciary within the constitutional
                    apparatus. He was relevant within his contemporary context and, in many ways,
                    even more so for the future.</p>

                    </placeName> Press, 1967. Pp. viii, 244. Notes, index. $6.00.)</head>
            <p>This model monograph is a thorough and dispassionate analysis of how, between
                    1846 and 1848, the slavery controversy finally broke into the center of national
                    politics. Morrison's researches on this development have gone deeper
                    than those of any previous scholar. The other notable quality of his book is its
                    sure delineation of the relationship between the emerging slavery issue and the
                    practical political necessities and impulses that influenced the actors.</p>
            <p>The reader is shown in detail how David Wilmot's proposal to bar slavery
                    from the anticipated Mexican cession arose from the disaffection of northern and
                    northwestern Democrats with the Polk administration on a variety of matters.
                    Once introduced, the Proviso's eventually explosive effects were
                    related to the special sensitivities of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren's Barnburners on the one hand and Calhoun's
                    southern following on the other.</p>
            <p>Having dealt convincingly with the motives and actions of the politicians,
                    Morrison ventures some intriguing explanations for the strong responses of the
                    northern and southern electorates to the agitation. The issue of slavery
                    extension was not the issue of slavery per se, he insists. But though
                    peripheral, it proved an extraordinarily effective symbolic vehicle for the
                    concerns that clustered around slavery.</p>
            <p>The concern that was emotionally most important, he suggests, was the same in
                    both sections: "if the desire for white supremacy was the strongest
                    emotional force behind southern opposition to the Wilmot Proviso, it seems
                    likewise to have been one of the strongest emotional forces for the movement for
                    the Proviso in the North …" (p. 69). As northerners sought
                    to protect a land of free white men from encroachment by black slaves and a
                    white slavocracy, white men in the South, moved by "the same elements
                    of racial fear and hatred," were "most afraid that they would
                    be isolated within the union, left alone with their Negro problem and their
                    slaveholding solution; thus isolated the South would become an alien and
                    inferior section, and ultimately its social system would yield to that of the
                    North, precipitating a bitter racial conflict" (p. 73). The decision to
                    secede, when it finally came in 1860, was the last desperate alternative once
                    the battle for the territories had been lost.</p>

            <p>Smith and Judah have produced a lively, judicious, and well-balanced sampling of
                    northern attitudes during the tumultuous era which began with Lincoln's
                    election to the presidency and terminated <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-063-3-077"/>
                    with the fateful surrender at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Most of the 219 items are taken verbatim from newspaper
                    editorials, periodical articles, government documents, public addresses, private
                    correspondence, and memoirs. Though the subject matter of some excerpts is
                    predictable— complaints by army recruiters and dislocations within
                    the business community—Civil War aficionados will not find much that
                    is familiar here; the editors avoided many of the obvious sources. Followers of
                    Indiana history will find several selections of particular interest: an 1860
                    letter from a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cannelton</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s secession convention, an official 1863 account of
                    Copperhead violence in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName>, and a local newspaper report of a colorful Independence Day parade
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1864. Readers concerned with the quality of mass culture should
                    find much delight in an hilarious satire on the typical Civil War romantic
                    novel, selected from an 1864 issue of The Round Table.</p>
            <p>One of the book's nine sections (not to mention parts of others) deals
                    entirely with the Negro's problem, which is to say, the
                    white's problem. Such emphasis is only proper, for, despite all that
                    has been written about economic sectionalism, political fanaticism, and the
                    growth of a southern nationalism as causal explanations of the Civil War, the
                    situation that stirred the public conscience a century ago was the status of
                    Negroes in a white America—even as it does today.</p>
            <p>The editors have written a lucid opening essay and have interspersed the primary
                    material with a running commentary. These one-and two-paragraph introductions,
                    which precede each selection, are based on the most recent scholarship and are
                    happily bereft of historical sentimentalism. Occasionally one may quarrel with
                    the editors' choice of certain words and phrases. For example, they
                    admit that "the Radicals were not a cohesive group" (p. 95);
                    if so, the remark that Secretary of State Seward was "stigmatized by
                    Republican Radicals as a traitor both to his party and to his country's
                    welfare" (pp. 89-90) needs further clarification. Again, is it enough
                    to dismiss Radical opposition to Lincoln's renomination by referring to
                    the former as intriguers, grumblers, and sulkers, who, "with ill
                    grace," ultimately accepted the President's bid for a second
                    term (p. 114)? At times one wishes the editors had followed up some of their
                    vignettes. Surely the reader, after a fascinating newspaper report describing
                    racial segregation on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> streetcars in 1865, is entitled to learn the outcome of the
                    subsequent Negro boycott.</p>
            <p>From a technical standpoint it is too bad that the layout of the book is not on a
                    par with the substance. Both the student and the scholar would have been better
                    served had the identifying footnotes to each of the reproduced items appeared at
                    the bottom of the page rather than at the end of the book. But this minor
                    reservation does not detract from the over-all quality of this source history.</p>

            <p>Just before his tragic death in 1963, Walter Prescott Webb wrote that the South
                    long ago would have achieved a prosperity and felicity commensurate with her
                    abundant resources save for three stubborn obstacles-all legacies of an
                    unfortunate past: a congenital resistance to change, an
                    "overconcern" with the racial issue, and a sadly deficient
                    education. In Southern Tradition and Regional Progress (1960) Vanderbilt
                    economist William H. Nicholls had earlier argued that there was a demonstrably
                    inverse correlation between progressive achievement and the South's
                    abiding traditionalism. Shortly thereafter, Thomas D. Clark, a southern
                    historian at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, published his hopeful portrait of <hi rend="i">The Emerging
                    South</hi> (1961), the thesis of which was unequivocal: the South should abandon
                    its negativistic traditionalism and embrace the progressive American creed. Now
                    Clark and his colleague, Albert D. Kirwan, have published a history of the South
                    since Appromattox that is consistently imbued with this same unapologetically
                    liberal theme.</p>
            <p>This volume is at once a chronicle of "A Century of Regional
                    Change," a critique of its inadequacy, an affirmation of its direction,
                    and a plea for its rapid acceleration. The authors argue that although Henry
                    Grady's celebrated "New South" was largely a
                    stillborn myth in 1886, the subsequent ineluctable combination of the federal
                    government's resurgent commitment to social justice and what C. Vann
                    Woodward has called the "bulldozer revolution" had by 1965
                    worked a revolutionary and permanent transformation that southerners as
                    Americans should embrace. Clark and Kirwan have thereby directed their efforts
                    toward eroding the first of Webb's stumbling blocks, but they have
                    properly declined to respond to his admonition concerning the second obstacle.
                    Webb had invoked a Lincolnian metaphor in arguing that since the intractable
                    "stump" of the racial issue was too heavy to move and too
                    green to burn, then "the best we can do for the present is to plow
                    around it"—to "get on with the main
                    business" and "cultivate the rest of the field."
                    Instead, the authors have directly and lengthily confronted the invidious
                    consequences of the South's biracial system in expounding their
                    conviction that the southern white and Negro can progress only in concert.</p>
            <p>Webb's final obstacle, deficient southern education, is viewed by the
                    authors as so crucial to southern progress that they devote two of their
                    eighteen chapters to exploring its history and posing its challenge. Their
                    treatment of education, however, is exemplary of their problematical resolution
                    of the dilemma shared by all historians: how should they balance a chronological
                    treatment with a topical approach? While recent historical writing has
                    thankfully tended to avoid the worst pitfalls inherent in the arbitrary and
                    sterile legacy of "presidential history," Clark and Kirwan may
                    have strayed too far in the other direction. Only five of the chapters encompass
                    clearly <pb n="255" id="VAA4025-063-3-079"/> defined chronological segments. The
                    eleven topical chapters are all admirably reflective of thorough and
                    well-digested research, but each bridges the century in an organizational
                    pattern that may make the book less flexible than John Ezell's more
                    conventional <hi rend="i">The South Since</hi> 1865 (1963) to employ as a basic
                    text. Finally, the introductory chapter, the three chapters that focus on
                    biracialism, and the summary chapter on "The Evolving South"
                    endow the book with a kind of Beethovenesque coda that lends itself to
                    redundancy. Still, the message of the book is one of informed conviction briskly
                    aired. While this volume will doubtless provoke some questions as to the
                    propriety of such a reform-minded text, historians who share the
                    authors' conviction that the South should continue to shed the more
                    negative aspects of its historical legacy might hope that this book will be
                    partially instrumental in accelerating that change.</p>

            <p>The period between the two World Wars was one in which many Americans misjudged
                    the international position of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Our nation, we thought, was different from others, innocent of the
                    evils of world politics. Desiring to preserve this innocence—perhaps
                    more illusion than reality—we tried to defy forces of history which
                    (to paraphrase Reinhold Niebuhr) were creating a potential world community and
                    increasing the power of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> beyond that of any other nation.</p>
            <p>Leaders of American foreign policy in the interwar period did little to educate
                    citizens of the nation to the reality of the changing world—that the
                    free security of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was passing. Charles Evans Hughes was no exception. As Betty Glad
                    says, "He was … a man of his times, an exemplar of the
                    thought and values of the educated class of his day" (p. 1). Miss Glad,
                    a professor of political science at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, examines the thought and policies of Hughes for an insight to the
                    sources, structure, and policy consequences of the American mind intoxicated by
                    legalistic-moralistic approaches to international problems. Her study owes much
                    to the ideas of Hans J. Morgenthau and George Kennan. She centered her research
                    in the Hughes papers, including the Beerits memoranda, plus printed government
                    documents and various publications by Hughes. Apparently Miss Glad, although
                    using the published <hi rend="i">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes, did not use
                    Department of State records in the National Archives.</p>
            <p>After discussing early influences on Hughes, including such <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> University teachers as Ezekiel Robinson and J. Lewis Diman, who
                    emphasized moral law commanding nature and man and an evolution toward higher
                    forms of moral faculty, Miss Glad briefly traces Hughes' early career
                    and the development of his own social philosophy—a conservative
                    evolutionism fused with rationalism. It was an optimistic <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-063-3-080"/> philosophy which equated positive law and the mores
                    of his day with reason and justice. Hughes refused to admit that law and custom
                    might represent the stronger interests or that position, power, or chance might
                    dispense social rewards. Concluding that Hughes would neither innovate a
                    philosophy nor attempt new solutions to problems, the author then examines her
                    subject's foreign policies in light of these precepts.</p>
            <p>In beginning her discussion of Hughes' diplomacy, Miss Glad lays down a
                    yardstick to measure the statesman. Here emphasis is on the relationship of
                    policy to power: "If diplomacy is to accomplish its major task
                    … the diplomats must comprehend power realities which lie behind and
                    structure their discussions" (p. 130). Miss Glad then predicts that
                    Hughes will have difficulties along this line, and, in her examination, he does.
                    Like most Americans, Hughes failed to assume real interest in the European or
                    Far Eastern status quo and showed no willingness to use American power to
                    maintain it. In the Tacna-Arica dispute the secretary was too legalistic,
                    neglecting the political issue; other attempts for international conciliation
                    and arbitration often failed because he did not understand that national
                    interest depends on power as well as need. In Latin American policies Hughes was
                    generally successful because his country's interests were geared to its
                    power, but since he was dealing with such unequal neighbors he never fully
                    understood why the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> never had to resort to political alliances or threaten a major war.
                    The author's evaluation of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Conference (1921-1922) hits hard at this theme. "States
                    will not in the long run be restrained by either their own promises or abstract
                    principles when they can secure goals they consider important with a relatively
                    cheap expenditure of their military, economic, or political resources. They will
                    be deterred only by the knowledge that they would run serious risks if they
                    should attempt to overthrow the status quo" (p. 302).</p>
            <p>Much that the author presents is not new. Others have outlined her general theme;
                    her narrative of American foreign policy has been told elsewhere. Nonetheless,
                    her particular analysis of Hughes is a contribution to understanding American
                    diplomacy in the interwar period.</p>

            <p>In the wake of restructured educational approaches to the "new
                    math" and the "new sciences," the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Office of Education has turned to the social studies, i.e., history
                    and the social sciences. In 1963 it contracted with seven universities for the
                    establishment of centers where groups of scholars, teachers, and curriculum
                    specialists were encouraged to undertake jointly one or more of the following
                        <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-063-3-081"/> tasks: redefine goals for the social
                    studies, develop materials and methods needed to realize these goals,
                    disseminate the most promising results of their projects.</p>
            <p>Although the number of such projects has since increased, few, if any, results
                    are ready for implementation except on an experimental basis. It is not too
                    early, however, to see that a "new social studies" is on the
                    horizon and that it will succeed or fail depending on the teachers'
                    ability to cope with it.</p>
            <p>What are the implications of these projects? According to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fenton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "It will involve three clusters of objectives: attitudes
                    and values, the use of a mode of inquiry involving the development and
                    validation of hypotheses, and a variety of knowledge objectives… . A
                    range of objectives requires a range of teaching strategies" (p. v). In
                    part teachers will be expected to involve students in the development of
                    analytical questions to guide their search for data. They will aid students in
                    the use of this data to formulate, validate, revise, or reject hypotheses. Such
                    questions as, who were the leaders of a certain revolution, will no longer be as
                    important as, what are the attributes of revolutionary leaders? The memorization
                    of a set of scholarly conclusions will be secondary to the development of the
                    students' ability to conclude validly.</p>
            <p>Based on the presupposition that, "Most students learn to teach by
                    imitating their teachers" (p. 2), <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fenton</settlement>
                    </placeName> doubts that instructors who have been exposed exclusively to the
                    traditional expository method of instruction in their own background can reverse
                    field and teach history by an inductive approach. He concludes that,
                    "students who will in the future be expected to rely primarily on
                    inductive teaching techniques should be taught inductively" (p. vii).</p>
            <p>The volume asks three persistent questions: Why should we teach social studies?
                    How should we teach social studies? What should we teach in the social studies?
                    The text includes significant writings in which these questions are explored by
                    such widely cited thinkers and innovators as Jerome Bruner, John Dewey, Ruth
                    Benedict, Donald Oliver, and Byron Massialas.</p>
            <p>In addition, the book is unique in its inclusion of a quantity of illustrative
                    materials developed or selected by the new projects for the purposes of
                    inductive teaching. These materials range from sources as divergent as <hi rend="i">The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini</hi>, Hidy and

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Teaching the New Social Studies</hi> is far from the traditional
                    text for methods courses, but it is more than a book of readings. It is a
                    do-it-yourself kit which invites the pre-service or in-service teacher to mold
                    his own learning in much the same manner he would aid his students in molding
                    theirs. Although it is intended for high school teachers, there is something
                    here for anyone concerned with the role of history and the social sciences in
                    education. Even if it were not the only book of this kind, it might still have
                    been the best.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $7.95.)</head>
            <p>The present study treats only a fragment of the large subject enunciated in the
                    book's title. It considers the process which by 1962 had brought about
                    the acceptance of the soft loan as a device for transferring American capital to
                    underdeveloped economies. The manner in which this occurred is cause for
                    inquiry. It seems doubtful whether, from the standpoint of rigorous economic
                    theory, the soft loan can readily be defended, standing, as it does, between
                    orthodox finance on the one hand and the outright grant on the other. The first
                    alternative is available only if the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> were to liberalize its tariff policy; but this, though it would
                    help debtor nations to earn dollars in the American market, Congress has not
                    been willing to do in a decisive way. On the other hand, neither has Congress
                    been willing to countenance the outright granting of money on a large scale.</p>
            <p>The administration has been faced with these congressional attitudes. It has also
                    been confronted, particularly in the United Nations, with the insistent demand
                    of the poorer nations for financial assistance. The upshot of this situation,
                    fraught with dilemma, is the soft loan. The latter may take the form of surplus
                    agricultural products, or it may consist of actual money. In both cases
                    repayment is in the form of inconvertible currency. Since such currency has very
                    limited utility for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, a transaction of this kind is a mere facade for what is in fact, a
                    grant. It results—to repeat—from the endeavor of the
                    policy maker to accommodate the various political forces playing upon him.</p>
            <p>The impression that emerges most strongly from Baldwin's study is that
                    an international agency, above all the World Bank, is in the strongest position
                    to influence the receiving governments, forcing upon them the policies, often
                    unpalatable, most likely to promote economic development. The present reviewer
                    found particularly interesting the author's treatment of the World
                    Bank's "strategy of non-lending." This is simply to
                    say that inasmuch as the bank has something to offer which is badly wanted, the
                    bank is in a position to withhold its largess unless the borrower conforms to
                    specified conditions. To be sure, the bank has itself finally acquiesced in the
                    soft loan, administered through its affiliate, the International Development
                    Association. But loans made by the I.D.A. are to be repaid in convertible
                    currency, even though the terms are otherwise generous. Thus political
                    considerations, which have played hob with the foreign aid purveyed by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> bilaterally, are more manageable in the context of the World Bank,
                    insulated from the importunities of the borrower by virtue of the voting formula
                    in its Executive Board and having access to capital without the necessity of
                    seeking annual appropriations from a legislative body.</p>
            <p>So it seems to this reviewer, who is curious to know whether the author would
                    agree with this conclusion. Baldwin, who shows a fine analytical capacity, will
                    perhaps in the future, as he pursues his larger objective, feel free to make
                    judgments of this nature.</p>

            <p>Logistics is the "economics of warfare… . It provides the
                    substance that physically permits an army to ‘live and move
                    …’ " (p. viii). While it lacks the glamor of the
                    planning of grand strategy or of the execution of tactical operations, it is as
                    crucial in warfare as either. In The <hi rend="i">Sinews of War</hi> James A.
                    Huston of Purdue University describes in detail and analyzes the role of
                    logistics in the history of the army from 1775 to 1953.</p>
            <p>Here is the other side of the customary military history. The bloody footprints
                    at Valley Forge are familiar to every schoolboy, but that the clothing and food
                    shortages were, in part, the results of the breakdown of the transportation
                    system is not. Almost two centuries later the beginning of the Cold War would be
                    a matter of controversy. Details of the logistical situation of the American
                    forces in Europe in the late 1940's indicate clearly that the mission
                    of these troops was simply occupation duty. It was not until 1950 that the army
                    moved its principal supply line from a position parallel to and within a few
                    miles of the Soviet zone to a more defensible location.</p>
            <p>This is not a book with which one settles down for an evening of escape.
                    Obviously, this is not its purpose. A history of military logistics will never
                    supplant the "still another" book on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> for entertainment. Yet, here are details which anyone interested in
                    military history should delight in having available in his library. In August,
                    1944, there were 5,958 vehicles involved in the Red Ball Express supplying
                    Eisenhower's armies in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. When the quartermaster general bought the first automobiles for
                    the army in 1906, the Treasury Department ruled that he had exceeded his
                    authority and charged the purchase to the general's personal account.
                    Union surgeons officially performed 29,980 amputations during the Civil War. In
                    the spring of 1778, one of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s soldiers could look forward to a daily ration of one and
                    one half pounds of bread, a pound of beef or fish or pork and beans, and a gill
                    of whiskey. During the Korean War the army shipped 31,500,000 tons of supplies
                    to the Far East-an amount more than twice the tonnage shipped to the American
                    Expeditionary Forces in 1917-1918. Such details aid in establishing a proper
                    perspective of a time or of a specific problem.</p>
            <p>From the days of the colonial militia to the more complicated 1950's
                    Huston has analyzed as well as described the development of logistics. Experts
                    might note a minor gap here and there while some overlapping may bother a
                    reader. But the same experts should be pleased that the author has indicated and
                    criticized logistical failures, military organizational deficiencies, and the
                    preparedness myth. He deserves praise for his achievement in overcoming the
                    enormous problem of researching and writing a book of this broad, comprehensive
                    nature.</p>

                    order after both a major war and a major revolution. Its experience in the
                    second of these endeavors is the subject of Thompson's book. Like a
                    Soviet book published a few years ago on the same subject, it might well have
                    been entitled <hi rend="i">The Russian Question at the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The author has emphasized those issues which were of the most direct concern to
                    the conference, such as the Prinkipo proposal, the Bullitt mission, and various
                    plans for the containment of the revolution in Russia. Further, he has centered
                    his attention on the conference and its deliberations rather than on the
                    Russians or events in Russia. The White Russian representatives in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> are treated briefly, though perhaps adequately in view of their
                    impact on the conference. The formation of the Third International, while of the
                    greatest interest in this context, is properly given only the briefest mention.
                    The Japanese, both as members of the conference and as directly interested
                    parties where the Russian Revolution was concerned, are a subject that could
                    profitably have been given a larger role in this narrative.</p>
            <p>Separate topics are given continuity in a way that seems appropriate in view of
                    their importance in the minds of the conference leaders. They are related to the
                    large issues which the conference faced, such as: defeated and revolutionary

                    either from their political right or left or a combination of these extremes.</p>
            <p>The treatment of these topics and issues is characterized by a careful weighing
                    of a considerable amount of evidence, much of it new but all of it very
                    effectively used. It is also characterized by balanced judgments on many
                    individual, significant issues; by a conspicuous readiness to give full
                    consideration to individual and national interests; and by a high degree of
                    respect for the contemporary context of views and events. In short, the book is
                    a gratifying product of a search for an understanding of the early reception of
                    the Soviet regime in the West.</p>

                        "just another book" about Abraham Lincoln. Its
                        contributors include poets, senators, governors, historians, and statesmen;
                        its contents range from poetry through speeches and essays. The volume

                        or scholarly, the work will evoke in its readers complete understanding and
                        agreement with Adlai Stevenson's concluding remarks: "we
