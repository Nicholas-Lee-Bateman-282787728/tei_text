					<lg>
						<l>Oftimes the simplest things will yield</l>
						<l>The sweetest verse; the wood, the field,</l>
						<l>The brooklet, hazel-hedged, that creeps</l>
						<l>Through wild wood ways or smiling sleeps</l>
						<l>Within the dingle, lily-strewn,</l>
						<l>The summer stars, the harvest moon,</l>
						<l>The swallows' twit'ring'round the barn,</l>
						<l>The loons lone cry from dismal tarn,</l>
						<l>The cattle standing in the stream,</l>
						<l>May each one prove a fitting theme</l>
						<l>From which the poet weaves and weaves</l>
						<l>A witchery of words that leaves</l>
						<l>Within the heart a magic spell.</l>
						<l>We feel and yet we cannot tell</l>
						<l>From whence the mystic power springs,</l>
						<l>But oft a pleasing couplet clings,</l>
						<l>And, running riot through the brain,</l>
						<l>We cull it o'er and o'er again,</l>
						<l>And something in the thought or rhyme</l>
						<l>Gives pleasure for all aftertime.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>And he who scorns the poets art</l>
						<l>And counts his work a useless part</l>
						<l>Misses the melodies of life;</l>
						<l>He reads the prose and joins the strife,</l>


						<pb id="VAA9489-008" n="10"/>


						<l>And, may be useful to his kind,</l>
						<l>But many a song that rests the mind</l>
						<l>And cheers the heart, he does not hear;</l>
						<l>And many a rainbow will appear,</l>
						<l>And many a golden sunset show</l>
						<l>A promise he may never know.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>And if my lines, though crude, contain</l>
						<l>One simple soulful sweet refrain</l>
						<l>Which brings one moment of delight</l>
						<l>To some poor weary wayworn wight</l>
						<l>My efforts have not been in vain.</l>

						<hi rend="i">(Prelude.)</hi></head>
					<lg>
						<l>A dreary evening of an autumn day,</l>
						<l>A moan among the trees, a sky of gray,</l>
						<l>A tangled flight of crows, a wind blown bird,</l>
						<l>Beyond the misty marsh a huddled herd,</l>
						<l>A broad brown marsh where russet rushes sway</l>
						<l>In breast high waves with here and there a spray</l>
						<l>Of wild rice tossed above them in the wind,</l>
						<l>A wilderness before, a waste behind,</l>
						<l>A well worn tent beside a flag fenced pond,</l>
						<l>A thicket growth of birch, and just beyond</l>
						<l>The restless river tossing in its bed,</l>
						<l>Such was the picture which about us spread.</l>
						<l>We; who had started at the early dawn:</l>
						<l>And hopefully all day had traveled on</l>
						<l>Across unfriendly tracts of barren land,</l>
						<l>Of tangled marsh and slopes of yielding sand;</l>
						<l>And through this never ending sameness came;</l>
						<l>Found here beside the sullen stream the same</l>
						<l>Monotony of marsh and sand and plain,</l>
						<l>Night coming on, mist turning into rain,</l>
						<l>No boat in sight, no boatman to be seen,</l>
						<l>Nor any shelter howe'er poor and mean,</l>
						<l>Save that lone tent beside the little pond.</l>
						<l>But there are none more ready to respond</l>
						<l>In time of need, more quick to see distress,</l>
						<l>And with unconscious openhandedness</l>
						<l>Divide their all, though little it may be,</l>
						<l>Than these same men, who lead the lonely, free,</l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-010" n="12"/>

						<l>Unselfish life of dwellers in the wood.</l>
						<l>Our wishes known, our wants once understood,</l>
						<l>A heartier welcome to wayfaring men</l>
						<l>Was never given than was given then;</l>
						<l>And, op'ning wide his tent, without ado,</l>
						<l>Our new found friend cameforth and built anew</l>
						<l>His smold'ring camp fire till its ruddy light</l>
						<l>Made cheery all within, drove back the night</l>
						<l>Beyond the birch tree thicket, and its gleam</l>
						<l>Slipped through the trees and kissed the troubled stream.</l>
						<l>Then from his simple store he brought us food,</l>
						<l>A steaming pot of fragrant coffee brewed,</l>
						<l>And then with hearty " Help yourselves" he bid</l>
						<l>Us eat; and never yet at banquet did</l>
						<l>More willing guests partake of better fare</l>
						<l>Nor host supply each want with kindlier care.</l>
						<l>The supper done, our host spread wide a couch</l>
						<l>Of dry marsh-grass; passed his tobacco pouch;</l>
						<l>And lying there in languorous restfullness,</l>
						<l>He who has never known could never guess</l>
						<l>What sweet abandonment upon us stole,</l>
						<l>How much contentment from each glowing bowl</l>
						<l>And camp fire's friendly light was gathered there,</l>
						<l>And all the day's discomforts otherwhere.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Our host, his kindly interest unconcealed,</l>
						<l>Plied us with questions; and in turn revealed,</l>
						<l>In his unlettered way, this simple tale;</l>
						<l>And yet, retold, words somehow seem to fail</l>
						<l>To carry with them that sad undertone</l>
						<l>Which ran beneath a pathos all his own;</l>
						<l>Nor from his words and manner could we trace</l>
						<l>He deemed the story more than commonplace.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>"Folks call me 'Ole Zeke Hardy,' an' I 'low</l>
						<l>I can't deny it, fer its too late now.</l>
						<l>There wuz a time, I 'spose, if I had tried</l>
						<l>I might been Mr. Hardy 'fore I died;</l>
						<l>But what might been has passed an' gone, an' I</l>
						<l>Don't worry 'bout it. Still I don't deny</l>
						<l>That sometimes when the loud winds fret the trees,</l>
						<l>An' way out on the marshes some o' these</l>
						<l>Here loon birds call, an' hoot owls answer back,</l>
						<l>An' mist clouds like race hosses on the track</l>
						<l>Go troopin' up the bayou as they do</l>
						<l>On nights like this, 1 can't help gettin' blue.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I fall to sorto' dreamin' like, an' go</l>
						<l>On the back track fer thirty yers or so.</l>
						<l>Ah! I was young an' hearty then an' strong;</l>
						<l>The days were longer; an' the yers as long</l>
						<l>As two o' them seem now; an' in our prime</l>
						<l>A good bit more'n half is summer time.</l>
						<l>I haven't allus lived as I do now;</l>
						<l>My younger days wuz spent behind the plow;</l>
						<l>I didn't take to schoolin'; but at work,</l>
						<l>You may'nt believe it, but I weren't no shirk.</l>
					</lg>

						<l>Growed up together, married, settled down</l>
						<l>Upon a little truck patch close to town.</l>
						<l>A year o' happiness, then come the noise</l>
						<l>O' drums an' fifes, an' nearly all the boys</l>
						<l>Went off to war, but I still stayed behind,</l>
						<l>But somehow I weren't easy in my mind.</l>
						<l>I got to feelin' sneakin' like an' mean.</l>
						<l>I s'pose that Mary all along had seen</l>
						<l>That somethin' troubled me an' guessed it right;</l>
						<l>Fer anyhow she come to me one night</l>
						<l>When our little one wuz three weeks old,</l>
						<l>An' put her arm around my neck, an' cold</l>
						<l>White cheek down close to mine an' whispered low,</l>
						<l>'Zeke, my Zeke, you get ready now an' go.'</l>
						<l>An' so I went, an' staid till it uz done;</l>
						<l>An', coward though I wuz, I couldn't run.</l>
						<l>When I got shaky I could hear her say</l>
						<l>In teary whispers, 'Zeke, my Zeke, you stay.'</l>
						<l>We tuck Atlanta, started for the sea,</l>
						<l>An' then it wuz my luck went back on me.</l>
						<l>No letters come; but none got letters then;</l>
						<l>But after weeks an' weeks I saw the men</l>
						<l>Get letters from their folks, an' I got none,</l>
						<l>Yet hungry as a starvin' man fer one.</l>
						<l>So things went on. At last I got a note</l>
						<l>A preacher sent, an' this is what he wrote,</l>
						<l>That Mrs. Hardy and the child were dead.</l>
						<l>--His other talk I think I never read.--</l>
						<l>There wuzn't nothin' left to fight fer now.</l>
						<l>"The war wuz over,' folks said. Anyhow,</l>
						<l>It wuz fer me. The boys all shoutin' glad</l>
						<l>At thoughts o' gettin' home most' set me mad,</l>
						<l>So I slipped out and an' didn't go on through</l>
						<l>To Washington to 'tend the big review.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-013" n="15"/>

					<lg>
						<l>An' so I'm Ole Zeke Hardy, an' I spose</l>
						<l>The record uv our reg'ment down there shows</l>
						<l>That I deserted, but, Sirs, I don't care.</l>
						<l>There is a heaven, an' my Mary's there;</l>
						<l>An' she's as proud o' what I done, no doubt,</l>
						<l>As if I'd waited to be mustered out."</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>The old man paused, put by his pipe, and said,</l>
						<l>"But you are tired. Let us all to bed."</l>
						<l>Less threat'ning and less sullen now the sky;</l>
						<l>The wind had sobbed its anger to a sigh;</l>
						<l>And here and there a star peeped through a rift;</l>
						<l>And lapped the rhythmic river on the drift</l>
						<l>A soothing lullaby with charms to press</l>
						<l>The eyelids down to sweet forgetfulness.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>How oft it happens when the day goes wrong,</l>
						<l>When mid our cares there seems no place for song,</l>
						<l>Worn out, we sink to slumber; and the light</l>
						<l>Of morn shows we were wrong, the world was right.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>And thus it was; while still the river lay</l>
						<l>Within the shadows of the morning gray,</l>
						<l>There came the sound of voices, nearer still,</l>
						<l>From somewhere up the stream; but not until,</l>
						<l>Rounding a bend, their boats came into view</l>
						<l>Could we discern what now we saw was true.</l>
						<l>Our friends were coming! And then loud and long</l>
						<l>We joined them in the chorus of their song.</l>

						<l>Old Richard, gaunt and straight and tall,</l>
						<l>Of whom his neighbors, one and all,</l>
						<l>Avow there can be no mistake,</l>
						<l>That good dame nature tried to make</l>
						<l>A thoroughly contented man,</l>
						<l>And Nature always fills her plan.</l>
						<l>And there are those who will declare,</l>
						<l>And some profane will even swear,</l>
						<l>"'That Richard does not like to work,</l>
						<l>That he is something of a shirk."</l>
						<l>But I cannot subscribe to this.</l>
						<l>'Tis slander born of prejudice,</l>
						<l>For I have known him many a year,</l>
						<l>And what to others may appear</l>
						<l>As laziness has seemed to me</l>
						<l>A genuine phylosophy.</l>

						<l>You say he will not work. What then?</l>
						<l>Well, are there not ten thousand men</l>

						<l>Are clam'ring for his part to do?</l>
						<l>But in its way, Old Richard's name</l>
						<l>Has something more than local fame.</l>
						<l>No better hand at stalking deer,</l>
						<l>At casting troll, or throwing spear,</l>
						<l>At following hounds when at full cry,</l>
						<l>Or laden bees which homeward fly.</l>
						<l>In every kind of hunt or chase,</l>
						<l>Old Richard takes no second place.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>Well versed is he in nature's lore.</l>
						<l>Her hidden paths he can explore</l>
						<l>With confident and careless tread,</l>
						<l>And many a sign by him is read,</l>
						<l>And many a beauty he can see</l>
						<l>Which lies concealed from you and me.</l>
						<l>Here he is king, here let him reign,</l>
						<l>To make him else were all in vain.</l>
						<l>A slave at either hoe or spade,</l>
						<l>A vassal in the marts of trade,</l>
						<l>And worthless he, to many eyes</l>
						<l>Engaged in gainful enterprise,</l>
						<l>And everywhere, save in the wood</l>
						<l>Or on the stream, misunderstood.</l>
						<l>And if, for sooth, he can't agree</l>
						<l>With your concept of industry</l>

						<l>So much of wrong that seemeth good,</l>

						<l>To this belief, that Nature brings</l>
						<l>Into her plan all minor things,</l>
						<l>That somewhere in this perfect plan</l>
						<l>A place is made for every man,</l>
						<l>Some low, some high, some small, some great,</l>
						<l>Some slaves to fortune, some to fate,</l>
						<l>And he alone is free who stands</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Until at last Old Richard told</l>
						<l>How in these woods a hunter bold</l>
						<l>One evening late by chance had seen</l>
						<l>The new moon through the forest green.</l>
						<l>Over his left shoulder it had beamed</l>
						<l>And for a baleful moment gleamed.</l>
						<l>He knew the sign: for him the morrow</l>
						<l>Held disappointment, trouble, sorrow.</l>
						<l>The night closed in with dread and fear;</l>
						<l>But morning dawned so bright and clear</l>
						<l>Forgotten was the hapless fate</l>
						<l>That did for him this day await.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>While passing through a tangled glade,</l>
						<l>A pleasing sight his progress staid.</l>
						<l>In easy range, with footsteps slow,</l>
						<l>Came into view a milk white doe.</l>
						<l>Quick aim; but ere his rifle spoke</l>
						<l>With graceful bound to thicket broke</l>
						<l>The fleet albino. Then began</l>
						<l>A chase, the strangest ever ran ;</l>
						<l>Through forest paths where intertwine</l>
						<l>The grape and wayward trumpet vine</l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-022" n="24"/>

						<l>Through swales of cat-tails. thick and tall,</l>
						<l>And interlacing button-ball;</l>
						<l>Across the marsh until its rim</l>
						<l>Of forest falters and grows dim;</l>
						<l>Across the sand dunes, one by one,</l>
						<l>Until the day was almost done.</l>
						<l>A hundred times the game he saw;</l>
						<l>A score of times essayed to draw</l>
						<l>His rifle to his shoulder, when</l>
						<l>The doe would bound away again,</l>
						<l>Till weary with his fruitless chase,</l>
						<l>The hunter pauses for a space.</l>
						<l>When lo ! stark in the evening light,</l>
						<l>The doe again comes into sight.</l>
						<l>Quick springing up the yielding slope,</l>
						<l>The hunter presses full of hope.</l>
						<l>He reaches now the sand dune's crest,</l>
						<l>His eager eye makes searching quest,</l>
						<l>But stricken speechless with surprise,</l>
						<l>He scarce could credit his own eyes.</l>
						<l>Well may he cross himself in haste!</l>
						<l>For here upon the lonely waste,</l>
						<l>Instead of a doe as white as milk,</l>
						<l>A maiden, clad in creamy silk,</l>
						<l>With perfect form and graceful mein</l>
						<l>And step as stately as a queen,</l>
						<l>With parting lips and backward look,</l>
						<l>She, smiling, turns toward the brook,</l>
						<l>Whose softly murmuring ripples flow</l>
						<l>Between its mossy banks below.</l>
						<l>Our hunter paused in fear and dread,</l>
						<l>One moment paused, then turned and fled,</l>
						<l>For in that form he well could trace</l>
						<l>The white doe's suppleness and grace.</l>

						<l>" Now, by my life !" young Carrol cried,</l>

						<l>Small cause, I say, had he to bolt.</l>
						<l>He started out 'neath evil omen,</l>
						<l>Pursued a doe and found a woman,</l>
						<l>I count his luck as quite uncommon."</l>

						<l>How far in safety he may go."</l>

						<l>And camp fires dwindle when the fagots fail;</l>
						<l>And, warned by frequent yawns and failing light,</l>
						<l>Each spread his couch of fern leaves for the night.</l>
						<l>All save the poet. Through the evening long,</l>
						<l>He held aloof from story, jest and song;</l>

						<l>While lying there beneath a giant oak</l>
						<l>He saw the sparks mount upward with the smoke,</l>
						<l>Dart here and there in constant eager strife,</l>
						<l>And read in them the symbol of his life.</l>
						<l>Had he not vainly tried to mount still higher?</l>
						<l>Within his breast an all consuming fire</l>
						<l>Still urged him on. Was this to be his doom,</l>
						<l>A moment of vain effort, then the gloom</l>
						<l>Of fathomless oblivion? Oppressed,</l>
						<l>He closed his eyes and vainly tried to rest;</l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-024" n="26"/>
						<l>Arose at last and silently took boat;</l>
						<l>Pushed out upon the stream and let it float,</l>
						<l>Unguided, down the silent, darkling tide</l>
						<l>Until he came upon a bayou wide,</l>
						<l>Deep fringed with willows; pushing in between</l>
						<l>And through the mage of sedges, lush and green,</l>
						<l>Came out upon its waters, deep and still.</l>
						<l>From somewhere in the forest came in shrill,</l>
						<l>Complaining notes an owlet's lonely cry.</l>
						<l>The pale belated moon crept up the sky</l>
						<l>And lent a silvery setting to the scene.</l>
						<l>The soft winds sighed among the willows green.</l>
						<l>A great blue heron winged his cumbrous flight</l>
						<l>Across the vast star studded arch of night,</l>
						<l>A water rat, disturbed at feast or play,</l>
						<l>Or hungry pickerel in his rush for prey,</l>
						<l>Splashed noisily among the reeds; and then</l>
						<l>All nature seemed to sink to sleep again.</l>
						<l>Upon a pile of fish nets in the prow,</l>
						<l>Our poet lay and bared his fevered brow;</l>
						<l>And, to his sleeping comrads all unknown,</l>
						<l>Warred out his hour of weakness all alone.</l>

					<head rend="center">THE BEE HUNT.</head>


					<lg>
						<l>The sun scarce tipped the tallest trees</l>
						<l>With faintest tinge of rosy light,</l>
						<l>While through the forest came a breeze</l>
						<l>Bathed in the coolness of the night,</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>As on a winding woodland way</l>
						<l>In single file we went, until</l>
						<l>We came to where the marhes lay,</l>
						<l>So peaceful, purple, and so still.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>Some sought the marsh's farther side</l>
						<l>Where fields of plumy wild rice grow,</l>
						<l>For here it is the mallards hide,</l>
						<l>And flocks of blue wings come and go;</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>But out upon the open land,</l>
						<l>Old Richard here his footsteps staid</l>
						<l>And improvised a sort of stand</l>
						<l>Of broken boughs and on it laid</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>A piece of honey in the comb,</l>
						<l>A drop of something from a phial,</l>
						<l>A secret mixture brought from home,</l>
						<l>And then he waited for a while.</l>
					</lg>


					<pb id="VAA9489-028" n="30"/>




					<lg>
						<l>First came a great bluebottle fly</l>
						<l>And then a wasp on buzzing wing,</l>
						<l>A big bald hornet blundered by,</l>
						<l>Then came a bee, poor foolish thing!</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>"Alas! Alas!" the poet cried,</l>
						<l>"How liken unto human greed!</l>
						<l>The bloom of summer hath supplied</l>
						<l>Sufficient for thy yearly need;</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>'Yet not content with ample store,</l>
						<l>Thou bravest still the autumn wind,</l>
						<l>That thou mayest gather more and more.</l>
						<l>Thou art no better than my kind.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>"If thou didst know yon grizzled knave</l>
						<l>Had placed for thee this honied snare</l>
						<l>Wouldst thou with such imprudence brave</l>
						<l>The danger that is lurking there?</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>"Nor am I wiser far than thee;</l>
						<l>My luck too often proves mischance;</l>
						<l>I cannnot read what is to be,</l>
						<l>And fate for both is ignorance."</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>The poet stood in mute surprise:</l>
						<l>For lo! the bee was out of sight,</l>
						<l>Save to old Richard's practiced eyes,</l>
						<l>That watched it on its homeward flight.</l>
					</lg>


					<pb id="VAA9489-029" n="31"/>




					<lg>
						<l>"A splendid line!" the old man cried;</l>
						<l>And straightway for the wood he makes.</l>
						<l>Now let who can keep by his side</l>
						<l>Through timbered swamp and tangled brakes.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>His searching eye without delay</l>
						<l>Has scanned each tree from root to top,</l>
						<l>But now a windfall bars his way,</l>
						<l>And now the river bids him stop.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>He climbs; he creeps: he crashes through;</l>
						<l>And like a hound that leads the pack,</l>
						<l>He wades the stream and starts anew</l>
						<l>With lagging followers farther back;</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>Till deep within the forest dim,</l>
						<l>He stops to give a ringing shout.</l>
						<l>See yonder gnarled and riven limb</l>
						<l>Where bees are pouring in and out!</l>

						<l>I cannot tell with what content,</l>
						<l>With what supreme enjoyment</l>
						<l>We gathered at the evening board,</l>
						<l>A tired, happy, hungry horde,</l>

					<lg>
						<l>An unkempt country road way, leading down</l>
						<l>Through worn out pasture lands, now thickly set</l>
						<l>With sumach and with elder, turns aside</l>
						<l>To ramble for awhile beside a stream,</l>
						<l>A little babbling brook, which seems to play</l>
						<l>Forever in the shade, but tires at last,</l>
						<l>Slips from the shadows, and goes laughing by</l>
						<l>A tiny low roofed cottage, half concealed</l>
						<l>Behind tall licac bushes and a screen</l>



						<pb id="VAA9489-031" n="33"/>

						<l>Of morning glory vines, which wound about</l>
						<l>The latticed porch and clambered to the eaves.</l>
						<l>Upon this road one summer afternoon,</l>
						<l>A youthful horeman, riding with loose rein,</l>
						<l>Came slowly down the hill slope to the stream.</l>
						<l>His garb, a uniform of faded blue,</l>
						<l>Was torn and disarranged; and, at his side,</l>
						<l>An empty scabbard dangled; and his face,</l>
						<l>Palid and drawn, betokened mortal pain;</l>
						<l>And, as he came, the snow white clover bloom</l>
						<l>Beneath his stirrup changed to crimson hue.</l>
						<l>His steed showed signs of having traveled far;</l>
						<l>His blood red nostrils and his heaving sides</l>
						<l>And foam flecked flanks told plainly he had come</l>
						<l>At greater speed than this slow moving pace.</l>
						<l>A goodly steed he was, clean limbed and strong,</l>
						<l>Which never yet had needed spur; but now,</l>
						<l>With quick intelligence he seemed to know</l>
						<l>His master's hand was all unfit to guide;</l>
						<l>And slowly, carefully, he picked his way</l>
						<l>Among the wheel ruts and the storm bared stones</l>
						<l>And came and stood at last besides the stream,</l>
						<l>Here waited patiently until he saw</l>
						<l>His stricken master safely on the sward,</l>
						<l>Then plunged midside into the pool and drank,</l>
						<l>Then came and bated grass beside the road.</l>
						<l>The youthful rider slaked his burning thirst</l>
						<l>And stanched as best he could his flowing wounds;</l>
						<l>And, all too weak to mount again, he wove</l>
						<l>His fingers in his horses mane and went</l>
						<l>Wi h many pauses down the winding way.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>At early dawn, from far beyond the hills</l>
						<l>Had come that day the sullen sounds of war,</l>
						<l>Which came and went like surges of the sea,</l>


						<pb id="VAA9489-032" n="34"/>

						<l>Now beating up until it seemed, they soon</l>
						<l>Must break across the hill tops, then again</l>
						<l>Dying away until, by distance dimmed,</l>
						<l>Were scarcely audible. And all day long</l>
						<l>At frequent intervals, fair Winogene</l>
						<l>Had come and stood beside the cottage gate</l>
						<l>And looked with longing eyes far up the road;</l>
						<l>For in that storm that seemed to shake the earth</l>
						<l>An only brother bore a soldier's part.</l>
						<l>Ah ! men may boast of strength to do and dare</l>
						<l>And with brave courage meet as brave a foe,</l>
						<l>But combat such as this is idle play</l>
						<l>Beside weak woman, braving ou her fear.</l>
						<l>But as the falling sunlight fell upon</l>
						<l>And lighted up the margin of the wood,</l>
						<l>The anxious watcher saw two moving forms</l>
						<l>'Merge from the shadows and come slowly on.</l>
						<l>The grime of battle and the dusty road</l>
						<l>Had almost changed to gray a coat of blue;</l>
						<l>Small wonder then, the maiden's wistful eyes</l>
						<l>Beheld her brother coming. Love and fear</l>
						<l>Lent swiftness to her feet; but, drawing near,</l>
						<l>She, undecided, paused and would have fled;</l>
						<l>But as she turned, she cast one backward look</l>
						<l>And saw the stranger's hand slip from his hold</l>
						<l>Upon his horse's mane and saw him fall,</l>
						<l>A seeming lifeless corpse beside the road.</l>
						<l>In sweet compassion, now she turned again</l>
						<l>And came and knelt one moment by his side;</l>
						<l>And, finding life still lingered, quickly went</l>
						<l>And summoned to her aid a faithful slave,</l>
						<l>An old man, bent and seamed and gray, but strong,</l>
						<l>Who came and lifted in his brawny arms</l>
						<l>And carried gently as he would a babe</l>



						<pb id="VAA9489-033" n="35"/>

						<l>The still unconscious form to his own hut</l>
						<l>And laid it gently on his humble bed;</l>
						<l>Then, with deft hands, which years had given skill,</l>
						<l>Removed the blood-stained garments, washed with care</l>
						<l>Each gaping wound, and bound them up anew,</l>
						<l>And pressed a little brandy to the lips.</l>
						<l>The trooper stirred, sighed deeply, looked about</l>
						<l>As one who scarce awakens from a dream,</l>
						<l>Took, half unconsciously, the proffered cup</l>
						<l>Of soothing cordial, closed his eyes and slept.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Then came long weeks when life was at low ebb;</l>
						<l>And when again he 'wakened to the world,</l>
						<l>Beside him stood a vision beautiful.</l>
						<l>His feeble senses would not let him speak</l>
						<l>For fear the dream might vanish at his words;</l>
						<l>And so he lay all motionless until</l>
						<l>His senses wrought a certainty; and then</l>
						<l>He opened wide his eyes and smiling said,</l>
						<l>" I thought you were an angel, and in sooth,</l>
						<l>I am not sure you are not, even now."</l>
						<l>But she who stood beside him, when she saw</l>
						<l>From something in those eyes of hazel hue</l>
						<l>And something in the smile upon his lips</l>
						<l>That from his mind the cloud had passed away,</l>
						<l>Laughed merrily and said. " Ah! sir, how dull,</l>
						<l>How very dull you are! You have not read</l>
						<l>Your Bible as you should, else you would know</l>
						<l>Of all the angels who have yet appeared</l>
						<l>Upon this lowly earth, not one has worn</l>
						<l>The garb of woman. All, it seems, are men."</l>
						<l>"Well answered, my fair maid," the trooper cried,</l>
						<l>"But tell me truly, did we win the day ?</l>
						<l>And where is my good steed and where am I?</l>
						<l>And how, by fortune favored, am I here?"</l>


						<pb id="VAA9489-034" n="36"/>

						<l>And nothing loath, the maiden answered him;</l>
						<l>"Ah, sir! the day was neither lost nor won.</l>
						<l>Your steed is safe; and you are safe, for now</l>
						<l>The tide of war has drifted farther south.</l>
						<l>You have been very ill; been sorely hurt;</l>
						<l>But you are better now and I am glad;</l>
						<l>But I must go and call good Hercules</l>
						<l>And tell my mother. She, too, will be glad.</l>
						<l>His wounds long held him prisoner in the hut.</l>
						<l>The cottage held him captive longer still.</l>
						<l>When love and duty are at odds-- ah, then!</l>
						<l>Alas for duty! Love will find excuse</l>
						<l>And weave of sophistry a web so fine</l>
						<l>That duty stands disarmed of argument.</l>
						<l>While thus the trooper lingered on in doubt,</l>
						<l>A southern soldier, maimed and travel worn,</l>
						<l>Came to the cottage door one evening late</l>
						<l>And begged to share its comforts till the morn.</l>
						<l>Welcomed and warmed and fed, he told his tale</l>
						<l>Of wounds and capture, prison and parole.</l>
						<l>'And I have traveled far today," he said.</l>
						<l>"For I had hoped to reach the Wolfort place."</l>
						<l>"And so you have, good sir," his hostess said.</l>
						<l>"For this is Wolfort place. The hall was burned."</l>
						<l>"Then Madam," cried the soldier, "I salute</l>
						<l>The mother of the bravest man I know."</l>
						<l>"My son! Oh, tell me, sir, is he alive?"</l>
						<l>"Aye, truly. Yes, I know he is alive.</l>
						<l>We fought and fell together, and for weeks</l>
						<l>Lay side by side, recovering from our wounds.</l>
						<l>And yet I fear all is not well with him.</l>
						<l>And shamed am I to tell it, but in truth</l>
						<l>A little Yankee lass, his nurse and mine,</l>
						<l>Has made him captive by her witchery.</l>


						<pb id="VAA9489-035" n="37"/>

						<l>And yet had I been younger -- who can tell --</l>
						<l>For she is good, and good to look upon.</l>
						<l>But hold --I have her picture. You shall see</l>
						<l>What charms have made such havoc with his heart;"</l>
						<l>The mother looked and said no word but sighed.</l>
						<l>But Winogene exclaimed, "How sweet she is !"</l>
						<l>But when the trooper looked, he laughed aloud.</l>
						<l>" A fair exchange," he cried, then laughed again,</l>
						<l>'For, by my soul! this is my sister's face."</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Peace, like a benediction came at last;</l>
						<l>And, with the years, the anger and the hate,</l>
						<l>The scars and sorrows, slowly faded out.</l>
						<l>Two mansions face each other on the hill</l>
						<l>With signs of peace and plenty everywhere;</l>
						<l>And, sitting by the tiny cottage door,</l>
						<l>A sweet faced woman, wrinkled now and gray,</l>
						<l>Watches her grandsons, little Lee and Grant,</l>
						<l>And smiles to see them play at mimic war</l>
						<l>Among the lilac bushes in the yard.</l>

					<head rend="center">THE LEGEND OF GRAPE ISLAND.</head>


					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">PART I.</head>

						<lg>
							<l>Upon this stream, some three days' journey down</l>
							<l>From the old portage, where the brave LaSalle</l>
							<l>And Tony, of the Iron Hand, first crossed</l>
							<l>From the St. Joe to the Kankakee,</l>
							<l>A little wooded isle, surrounded quite,</l>
							<l>By river, marsh, and bayou, may be found.</l>
							<l>For centuries a famous camping place,</l>
							<l>And to this day, the voyager often sees</l>
							<l>The gleam of campfires through the scanty growth</l>
							<l>Of oak and sassafras upon its shore.</l>
							<l>There was a time; when, here among the trees,</l>
							<l>There grew a tangled wilderness of vines.</l>
							<l>Some trailed upon the ground, while others climbed</l>
							<l>High up among the tree-tops, there to spread</l>
							<l>A canopy of sunless emerald;</l>
							<l>Here in the autumn-time was often hung</l>
							<l>A vintage of strange flavor, rich and rare,</l>
							<l>For no one in the country round about,</l>
							<l>Nor yet the stranger from afar, had found</l>
							<l>The likeness of this fruit. How came it there?</l>
							<l>What kindly hand had planted here the vine ?</l>
							<l>No one can tell, for truly no one knows;</l>
							<l>But 'mong the legends of this land is one</l>
							<l>Which I have heard; a strange pathetic tale,</l>
							<l>First told to me by one whose mem'ry runs</l>
							<l>For more than three score years into the past,</l>
							<l>Who had it from his grandsire older still;</l>



							<pb id="VAA9489-038" n="40"/>

							<l>And I have known the story now for years.</l>
							<l>While camping on this island years ago,</l>
							<l>One evening late, an old man in a boat</l>
							<l>Came punting slowly up the winding stream.</l>
							<l>The sky was low'ry, and the mist hung low;</l>
							<l>He moored his craft and came to where I sat.</l>
							<l>Wrinkled and gray he was, and old; but still</l>
							<l>He stood erect; and, though his garb was poor,</l>
							<l>There yet was something in the old man's mien</l>
							<l>Which marked him as above the mendicant.</l>
							<l>Touching his hat, "Good evening, sir," he said,</l>
							<l>" I find myself some distance from my camp.</l>
							<l>The night is here and there will be no moon;</l>
							<l>The stream is swifter than it used to be,</l>
							<l>Or else my strength is not what once it was;</l>
							<l>What chance, if I may ask, to stay with you?"</l>
							<l>"'Most welcome, sir," I answered him : and soon,</l>
							<l>His luggage piled within my little tent,</l>
							<l>The old man, half reclining on the sward</l>
							<l>Beside the fire, chatted pleasantly,</l>
							<l>While I prepared for him a simple meal --</l>
							<l>Such as a hunter may -- of fish and game,</l>
							<l>And from a store which I had found that day</l>
							<l>A few small clusters of delicious grapes.</l>
							<l>And when he saw the fruit, he took it up</l>
							<l>And pressed it to his lips, but did not eat.</l>
							<l>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "the Sieur de LaSalle!</l>
							<l>I thought they all had perished long ago.</l>
							<l>Time was when here upon this island grew</l>
							<l>A vineyard fair to see; but wanton waste</l>
							<l>And careless camp fires long ago had wrought</l>
							<l>Such havoc here, I had not thought to see</l>
							<l>Another of their kind. But do you know</l>
							<l>The story of these grapes? Have you not heard?</l>


							<pb id="VAA9489-039" n="41"/>

							<l>Wait then, until I finish my repast</l>
							<l>And I will try to tell it once again."</l>
							<l>When done, he took a cluster in his hand</l>
							<l>And held it up so that the light shone through;</l>
							<l>And then, as one who talks unto himself,</l>
							<l>He said, "Ah, yes, the color of old wine!</l>
							<l>When first I tasted of these grapes I stood</l>
							<l>Among the comrads of my early youth.</l>
							<l>A hardier lot of trappers ne'er set stake;</l>
							<l>A truer band of brothers ne'er were born.</l>
							<l>Where are they now? Some asleep in sunny France;</l>
							<l>Some in the church-yard at the good St. James</l>
							<l>Far up in old Quebeck; and some have found</l>
							<l>A resting place beside this peaceful stream;</l>
							<l>While others, more of Indian blood than French,</l>
							<l>Have wandered westward, where I do not know;</l>
							<l>And I alone am left; and I have come</l>
							<l>To view once more the old familiar haunts</l>
							<l>And bid to each of them a last adieu."</l>
							<l>The old man paused and tasted of the fruit,</l>
							<l>And then exclaimed, "Mon Dieu, How I forget!</l>
							<l>I promised you a story did I not?</l>
							<l>And shall I tell it? Well then, here it is.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Somewhere among the vine clad hills of France,</l>
							<l>-- Just where I do not know. It matters not.--</l>
							<l>A rich vine grower lived, whom I shall call</l>
							<l>Francisco, thought in truth 'twas not his name.</l>
							<l>A widower he was; an only child,</l>
							<l>Which came to him the day its mother died,</l>
							<l>Was, save a few old servants, all he had</l>
							<l>By way of household; and his friends were few.</l>
							<l>Francisco prospered; year by year his wealth,</l>
							<l>And year by year his cares increased as well.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-040" n="42"/>

							<l>His vineyards spread beyond his native vale,</l>
							<l>And far beyond the seas his wares were praised.</l>
							<l>Some said he knew a secret charm which gave</l>
							<l>The flavor and the sparkle to his wine;</l>
							<l>While others said old Hilda knew the charm.</l>
							<l>Else, why should proud Francisco often bring</l>
							<l>Fair presents to Dame Hilda's little cot?</l>
							<l>Else, why should he with each returning spring,</l>
							<l>Take cuttings only from the spreading vines</l>
							<l>Which clambered over Hilda's humble door?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And so the years went by; the children played --</l>
							<l>His daughter, Annette, and old Hilda's son --</l>
							<l>About the wine press or among the vines;</l>
							<l>And with the years, their childish friendship grew</l>
							<l>And ripened into something else besides.</l>
							<l>Old Hilda saw and nodded to herself,</l>
							<l>And smiled to see Francisco was so blind.</l>
							<l>But what the eyes may sometimes fail to see</l>
							<l>The ears may hear, and so it was with him.</l>
							<l>While walking in the vineyard all alone,</l>
							<l>He chanced to come upon the youthful pair;</l>
							<l>And overheard them talking in low tones;</l>
							<l>And, all unnoticed, listened for a while,</l>
							<l>Yet held his peace and slipped away unseen.</l>
							<l>"Why! they were children yesterday," he said,</l>
							<l>"And now they talk as full grown lovers do."</l>
							<l>But soon the boy was sent away to school;</l>
							<l>His daughter, too, was sent away as well,</l>
							<l>To learn those little nothings ladies know;</l>
							<l>And people said, "How kind to Hilda's child</l>
							<l>Francisco is." And so the time went by;</l>
							<l>But when the boy and girl were back again</l>
							<l>Among the vineyards, and the father saw</l>
							<l>That still his daughter looked with kindly eyes</l>

							<l>Upon the youth now grown to manhood's state,</l>
							<l>He climbed the hill to where the abby stood</l>
							<l>And sought the council of old Father Gean.</l>
							<l>"Good Father," said Francisco, "I have come</l>
							<l>To ask thy council. Hilda's son, it seems,</l>
							<l>Has found some favor in my daughter's eyes;</l>
							<l>And, for his father's sake, I wish him well.</l>
							<l>For 'twas his father who discovered first</l>
							<l>Or propagated -- call it what you will-- </l>
							<l>The kind of grape which makes Francisco wine;</l>
							<l>And strange to tell, the vines at Hilda's door,</l>
							<l>The vines his father planted, still must give</l>
							<l>The cuttings for my vineyards, for all else</l>
							<l>Yield but a barren vintage where they grow.</l>
							<l>And I must keep old Hilda's favor still,</l>
							<l>Yet I would have my only daughter wed</l>
							<l>Above her station rather than below.</l>
							<l>And now, good father, set your wits to work;</l>
							<l>And if between your prayers you find a plan</l>
							<l>To rid me of this boy yet leave me still</l>
							<l>The friend and neighbor of Old Hilda, then</l>
							<l>The spigot of your wine cask shall not fail."</l>
							<l>Old Father Gean laughed merrily and said,</l>
							<l>"I am too old to go without my wine;</l>
							<l>And yet I cannot promise over much;</l>
							<l>Leave me to think, and if I find a way</l>
							<l>I shall not fail to hold you to your word.</l>
							<l>Come this day week again and bring with you</l>
							<l>A flagon of your best, and I will try."</l>
							<l>And when they met again old Father Gean</l>
							<l>First drank his draught in silence, then he spoke.</l>
							<l>"What I can do must first be for the church;</l>
							<l>And after that, what little good I may</l>
							<l>For those I love and those who love the church.</l>
						</lg>


						<pb id="VAA9489-042" n="44"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Across the sea a new world waits the church;</l>
							<l>Both priests and laymen, young as well as old,</l>
							<l>Are needed there Why not send Hilda's son?</l>
							<l>Suppose you give him of thy wealth enough</l>
							<l>That he may barter with the savage tribes</l>
							<l>Suppose you say to him that you will see</l>
							<l>That want shall never come to Hilda's door?</l>
							<l>Tell him that you have seen what you have seen,</l>
							<l>And yet you think that he should win success</l>
							<l>Or do some service for the church or state</l>
							<l>E'er you could give consent for him to wed</l>
							<l>Your daughter with the dower she will bring.</l>
							<l>Speak to thy daughter first and then to him,</l>
							<l>And I will speak to Hilda in due time.</l>
							<l>I chance to know that at our court to-day</l>
							<l>A certain Robert Seur de LaSalle</l>
							<l>Has found much favor with our worthy king.</l>
							<l>He soon will sail for that new world again,</l>
							<l>And I can get free passage for the boy."</l>
							<l>" But should he win success and come to claim</l>
							<l>My daughter and dowery, what then?"</l>
							<l>The old priest laughed right merrily and said,</l>
							<l>"Why, I would say your money were well spent.</l>
							<l>But know you not, that of the thronging hosts</l>
							<l>That in the past have sought those distant shores,</l>
							<l>The number who return is very small ?</l>
							<l>Some perish in the sea, some fall in war,</l>
							<l>And some by secret foe; but many fail</l>
							<l>To win success or e'en a passage home,</l>
							<l>And after while find in the wild free life</l>
							<l>A potent charm which holds them to the end."</l>
							<l>"Ah !'Father Gean, you have not yet lost your wits !"</l>
							<l>Exclaimed Francisco. "I shall see the boy;</l>
							<l>And, if I fail, I'll have him come to you,"</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-043" n="45"/>

							<l>Next day Francisco stayed within his house;</l>
							<l>Walked here and there as if in deepest thought;</l>
							<l>Until at last his daughter came to him</l>
							<l>And begged to know the burden of his mind.</l>
							<l>"My child," he said, "I have one only care,</l>
							<l>Your happiness. If that I can secure</l>
							<l>Then will I be content, for I shall feel</l>
							<l>That I have filled the purpose of my life.</l>
							<l>You love Sebastian. Nay, nay, do not blush,</l>
							<l>For he is certainly a goodly youth;</l>
							<l>And I had thought to train him in my stead;</l>
							<l>And for this purpose sent him off to school;</l>
							<l>But Father Gean, with whom I council oft,</l>
							<l>Urges me now to give him of my wealth</l>
							<l>And let him like the knights of old go forth</l>
							<l>And do some worthy work for church or state,</l>
							<l>Ere I consent that you and he may wed."</l>
							<l>His daughter, being young and having faith</l>
							<l>In Father Gean, and faith in him she loved,</l>
							<l>And though her heart grew heavy at the thought,</l>
							<l>Yet to herself she said, "I will be brave;"</l>
							<l>And to her father, "I will let him go."</l>
							<l>Tnen went Francisco to the little cot;</l>
							<l>And, seeing young Sebastian, called to him,</l>
							<l>"Come, my young friend, come have a walk with me."</l>
							<l>And as they strolled along Francisco told</l>
							<l>His story much the same as he had told</l>
							<l>It to his daughter, adding at the last,</l>
							<l>"I will not urge , but if you wish to go</l>
							<l>I will not stint you, for in doing so</l>
							<l>I would but add a hazard to success.</l>
							<l>I do it not for you but for my child,</l>
							<l>For had it been another whom she loved,</l>
							<l>Then for another would I do the same."</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-044" n="46"/>

							<l>Now young Sebastian oft had thought upon</l>
							<l>A journey very like the one proposed ;</l>
							<l>And thus to have Francisco offer help</l>
							<l>And even seem well pleased to further him,</l>
							<l>Like one who sees his fondest dream come true</l>
							<l>He lacked for words with which to voice his joy,</l>
							<l>And then Francisco spoke old Hilda, fair.</l>
							<l>"Your son," he said, "has come to man's estate:</l>
							<l>And, as becomes a man, he is in love.</l>
							<l>With whom, I warrant you, you have not guessed "</l>
							<l>"I have not guessed!" The good dame laughed aloud.</l>
							<l>"Why need I guess when I have eyes to see?</l>
							<l>For I have known what you might well have known;</l>
							<l>They have been lovers since their childhood days.</l>
							<l>Look you, Francisco, had it not been so,</l>
							<l>Your vineyards would not hold the only vines</l>
							<l>To bear the grapes which make Francisco wine;</l>
							<l>But you, Francisco, have been fair with me,</l>
							<l>As men count fairness; yet had I not known</l>
							<l>That sometime mine would share with yours the wealth,</l>
							<l>Which with the years your hands have gathered in,</l>
							<l>The cuttings from those vines beside my door</l>
							<l>Had found a market at a price which now</l>
							<l>Would build a mansion better far than thine."</l>
							<l>" Ah! then, my good dame Hilda, I am glad</l>
							<l>That you had eyes to see while I was blind.</l>
							<l>But, having learned the truth, I now have come</l>
							<l>To council with you, what is best to do.</l>
							<l>It seems to me they are full young to wed;</l>
							<l>And I had thought to keep the youth at school</l>
							<l>And after that to train him in my stead;</l>
							<l>But Father Gean advises otherwise.</l>
							<l>Still he is such a dreamer, and his dreams</l>
							<l>Are always for the good of the church or state --</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-045" n="47"/>

							<l>But I would have you talk with him, and then</l>
							<l>We two will have our council afterward.</l>
							<l>And so it happened in a day or two</l>
							<l>Old Father Gean came to the cottage door,</l>
							<l>And long he talked with Hilda, till at last</l>
							<l>Like Abraham of old she gave consent</l>
							<l>To make the sacrifice, her only son;</l>
							<l>And on the day the little ship set sail</l>
							<l>Which bore Sebastian from his native land</l>
							<l>The wine cask at the abbey was refilled.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The years went by; one, two, three, four, had passed.</l>
							<l>At intervals of many weary months</l>
							<l>A message came from far across the sea</l>
							<l>Which told the story of his journeyings;</l>
							<l>How he had landed safely with his wares;</l>
							<l>Had lingered at the mission for a time;</l>
							<l>Then with the brave La Salle had journeyed far</l>
							<l>Into the wilderness and came at last</l>
							<l>Through many hardships to a wondrous land</l>
							<l>Where many beaver lived and otter too,</l>
							<l>And here a remnant of an ancient tribe</l>
							<l>Had found retreat secure from their foes,</l>
							<l>For all about is marsh and swamp and stream,</l>
							<l>Save here and there a little wooded isle;</l>
							<l>How he had found these people well disposed,</l>
							<l>Had stopped with them and built a trading post</l>
							<l>And planted from the cuttings he had brought</l>
							<l>A tiny vineyard here among the trees.</l>
							<l>And when each message came Francisco then</l>
							<l>Would take his hat and cane and find his way</l>
							<l>To good dame Hilda's little cot and read</l>
							<l>It slowly over many times to her.</l>
							<l>This time it told quaint tales of Indian lore;</l>
							<l>And then again how once the Iroquois</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-046" n="48"/>

							<l>While on the war path found their little band,</l>
							<l>Which, taking refuge in the swamps, withstood</l>
							<l>A hundred painted warriors for a week,</l>
							<l>And slew so many that the rest withdrew;</l>
							<l>How afterwards the old chief, Eagle came</l>
							<l>And named him "Great Heart," which among the tribes</l>
							<l>Was greater honor than to be a chief.</l>
							<l>His daughter too, would take her messages,</l>
							<l>And read them also; though, perchance, some part,</l>
							<l>The first and last, old Hilda did not hear.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Thus far Francisco had no settled plan;</l>
							<l>Content he was to let the matter drift;</l>
							<l>And when Sebastian in the fourth year wrote</l>
							<l>How he had prospered far beyond his dreams,</l>
							<l>And how if fortune favored him for yet</l>
							<l>A little while, say two or three years more,</l>
							<l>He would return with wealth to more than match</l>
							<l>The dowery Francisco's wealth would yield,</l>
							<l>Francisco said, "Yes, we will let him toil</l>
							<l>As many years as Jacob did of old,</l>
							<l>And if he win the wealth which he foretell</l>
							<l>Why then I will not surely say him nay."</l>
							<l>But now it chanced the day this message came,</l>
							<l>His daughter was away, and business kept</l>
							<l>Francisco from dame Hilda's humble cot.</l>
							<l>And drinking wine with Father Gean that night</l>
							<l>Francisco met the Marquis de LaRoy.</l>
							<l>Warmed by the wine, the old priest's tongue was loosed;</l>
							<l>He to the Marquis praised Francisco's wine,</l>
							<l>His vineyards, and his wealth and daughter too,</l>
							<l>And to Francisco praised the noble name</l>
							<l>Of de LaRoy; and, growing eloquent,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-047" n="49"/>

							<l>Exclaimed, "Why not unite this noble name</l>
							<l>And wealth, and send the lady off to court !"</l>
							<l>And when Francisco rose to go, LaRoy</l>
							<l>Went with him to the hall, to bid adieu;</l>
							<l>And, as he took his hand, he said to him,</l>
							<l>" The good priest prattles foolishly at times,</l>
							<l>And yet, methinks, there's sense in what he said.</l>
							<l>Think on his words and I will come to you."</l>
							<l>His daughter wed a marquis ! Well, why not?</l>
							<l>A noble fortune for a noble name!</l>
							<l>And so he kept the message to himself.</l>
							<l>And when the marquis came, he promised him</l>
							<l>That he should wed his daughter in due time.</l>
							<l>"But wait a little while, for I must send</l>
							<l>This girl of mine to talk with Father Gean,</l>
							<l>For I would have you wed a willing bride.</l>
							<l>And since I ask you to delay," he said,</l>
							<l>"And since in time the fortune which I hold</l>
							<l>Will all be thine. If you have present need</l>
							<l>I beg of you to name the sum, and you</l>
							<l>Shall have it free from use or usury."</l>
							<l>And well supplied, the marquis went his way</l>
							<l>Content to wait Francisco's pleasure still,</l>
							<l>If still Francisco's purse would wait on him.</l>
							<l>And then Francisco went away from home</l>
							<l>A three days' journey to a seaport town</l>
							<l>Where he was all unknown, and gave it out</l>
							<l>That he was Emil Sego just returned,</l>
							<l>And seeking out a scrivener bade him write --</l>
							<l>For he, himself, he claimed was too unskilled --</l>
							<l>A letter to Francisco in his stead;</l>
							<l>How he a faithful follower and friend</l>
							<l>Of one Sebastian Labareau, had come</l>
							<l>Through many dangers once again to France,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-048" n="50"/>

							<l>And how at such a time a lawless band</l>
							<l>Did come upon the little trading post,</l>
							<l>Slew all the inmates, plundered, and then burned</l>
							<l>The store house. He alone by chance escaped;</l>
							<l>But in the night time, stealing back again,</l>
							<l>Had lingered long enough to give to each</l>
							<l>Unfortunate a Christian burial.</l>
							<l>And then he wrote a message somewhat long,</l>
							<l>In which, with many a sigh and pious saw,</l>
							<l>He told Sebastian how but recently,</l>
							<l>His mother, growing weary with her years,</l>
							<l>Had passed into that peaceful, perfect rest;</l>
							<l>And then in briefer business way he told</l>
							<l>Of Annette's marriage to the De LaRoy.</l>
							<l>The letters posted and the scrivener paid,</l>
							<l>And then Francisco took his homeward way.</l>
							<l>Why need to tell of Annette's wildest grief?</l>
							<l>Why need to tell of Hilda's deepest woe?</l>
							<l>Francisco saw, yet held his evil way;</l>
							<l>He longer sat with Father Gean each night</l>
							<l>And drowned his conscience in his good, red wine,</l>
							<l>Until one evening, after many days,</l>
							<l>His cunning failed him, and he told the priest</l>
							<l>The evil he had done. Told it as one</l>
							<l>Who tells of something worthy of all praise.</l>
							<l>The old priest listened, silent to the end;</l>
							<l>He then arose, his white face whiter still;</l>
							<l>And with his hands uplifted, cried aloud,</l>
							<l>"This is my sin, Oh Lord ! Oh, Lord, forgive!</l>
							<l>And since my counsel bears such evil fruit,</l>
							<l>Then let me bear the burden of this sin."</l>
							<l>Face downward on the rough stone floor he sank</l>
							<l>And prayed again, "Oh ! how shall I atone?</l>
							<l>Dear Holy Virgin, Mother of our Lord,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-049" n="51"/>

							<l>Help mne to find the way." Francisco fled,</l>
							<l>And all night long, he wandered 'mong the vines,</l>
							<l>Mad with the wine. He tried to hide himself;</l>
							<l>Demons and serpents seemed to lurk and hiss</l>
							<l>At him on either hand. On, on, he went,</l>
							<l>Through first one vineyard, then another, till</l>
							<l>In the gray dawn of morn he came and stood</l>
							<l>Beside a little pool. How clear it looked !</l>
							<l>How its cool depths would sooth his aching head !</l>
							<l>He saw no devils leering up at him;</l>
							<l>Here he could hide ; he would be safe at last.</l>
							<l>A plunge, a ripple on the pebbled marge,</l>
							<l>A few small bubbles, bursting one by one;</l>
							<l>And when the sun rose up it shone upon</l>
							<l>The placid lakelet fast asleep again.</l>
							<l>And with the morning went Old Father Gean</l>
							<l>To Hilda's little cot, and there confessed,</l>
							<l>Withholding naught, and taking the blame</l>
							<l>Upon himself. " Nay, nay, good Father, nay,"</l>
							<l>Old Hilda cried. " Your sin you have not named,</l>
							<l>For it doth lie in too much love of wine.</l>
							<l>As for Francisco, hark ye, Father Gean,</l>
							<l>A blight already lurks among his vines;</l>
							<l>His vineyards soon will be a worthless waste;</l>
							<l>His empty wine butts gaping at each stave;</l>
							<l>The curse of Hilda rests upon his wealth."</l>
							<l>Then going forth, took from the little porch</l>
							<l>A rusty mattock, and when evening came</l>
							<l>The spreading vines about the tiny cot,</l>
							<l>Both root and branch, were but a smouldering heap</l>
							<l>Of failing embers near by Hilda's door.</l>
							<l>Another year of weary waiting passed,</l>
							<l>And still no message came across the sea.</l>
							<l>The vineyards lay yellow beneath the blight</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-050" n="52"/>

							<l>The peasants said because of Hilda's curse.</l>
							<l>Francisco did not come; and no one knew</l>
							<l>What lay entangled in the sunken drift</l>
							<l>Beneath the surface of the silent pool.</l>
							<l>Tnen one day Father Gean came down the hill;</l>
							<l>His staff was in his hand, and on his back</l>
							<l>A mantle such as traveling pilgrims wear,</l>
							<l>And at his side a well filled palmer's pouch.</l>
							<l>He paused a moment at Francisco's gate</l>
							<l>And bade a servant send her mistress out.</l>
							<l>"My child," said he, when Annette came to him,</l>
							<l>"I could not come to you, for I have vowed</l>
							<l>That I will never rest nor sleep again,</l>
							<l>Beneath the roof tree of a Christian home</l>
							<l>Until I find Sebastian and have brought</l>
							<l>Balm to hearts which I have made to bleed."</l>
							<l>" Oh, Father Gean, how very strange !" she cried.</l>
							<l>" I, too, have made a vow, and on this day,</l>
							<l>It was my purpose first to come to you,</l>
							<l>And then make my way across the sea;</l>
							<l>And I have vowed I never will return</l>
							<l>Unless Sebastian may return with me."</l>
							<l>" So be it then. I add your vow to mine,"</l>
							<l>The old priest said; and, lifting up his eyes,</l>
							<l>He spread his hands above the maiden's head,</l>
							<l>And asked a blessing on their pilgrimage.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>The sea was not unkind, and in due time</l>
							<l>They landed in Quebec, and here they found</l>
							<l>A band of trappers who were on the eve</l>
							<l>Of starting westward. Some of them would go</l>
							<l>As far as Mackinaw, and some beyond;</l>
							<l>And with this band of rough, tho' kindly men,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-051" n="53"/>

							<l>They journeyed many days until they came</l>
							<l>To Fort Miamis. Here they tried in vain</l>
							<l>To find a guide who still could lead them on.</l>
							<l>But after weeks, and still no one was found,</l>
							<l>Then Annette said. "Good Father, let us go;"</l>
							<l>And so at last these two set out alone.</l>
							<l>For days they toiled, until one day they saw</l>
							<l>A sign upon the tree, a double cross,</l>
							<l>Which marked the portage to the Kankakee.</l>
							<l>"Take courage now, my daughter," said the priest,</l>
							<l>"Thus far our journey lay against the tide,</l>
							<l>But now the tide has turned." " Nay, Father Gean,"</l>
							<l>She said, "The current of the stream may change</l>
							<l>To help us on the way or hold us back;</l>
							<l>But in my heart a something says to me,</l>
							<l>'The tide will never turn ;' but I have learned</l>
							<l>To say with you in truth, 'Thy will be done.'"</l>
							<l>Yet. as they journeyed down the sluggish stream,</l>
							<l>A restlessness she did not try to hide,</l>
							<l>Seemed with each day to grow and urge her on.</l>
							<l>Oh, Father Gean, awake; 'tis time to go;"</l>
							<l>"Let us not stop for dinner, Father Gean ;"</l>
							<l>Why may we not go on tho' it is dark ?"</l>
							<l>Thus did she urge, each morning, noon and night.</l>
							<l>The old priest saw the flush upon her cheek,</l>
							<l>The fever burning in her restless eyes;</l>
							<l>And hastened with a great fear in his heart.</l>
							<l>Late in the evening of an autumn day,</l>
							<l>They came upon the little trading post,</l>
							<l>And here they landed. Hand in hand, they went</l>
							<l>Up from the river by the well worn path,</l>
							<l>And stood beneath the overhanging eaves;</l>
							<l>But all was silent, and the door was barred.</l>
							<l>" Courage, my daughter," still the old priest said,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-052" n="54"/>

							<l>"A wigwam stands a Ifttle way beyond ;</l>
							<l>There we may learn what we most wish to know."</l>
							<l>And as they went, an Tndian maiden came</l>
							<l>With wonder in her eyes and outstretched hands ;</l>
							<l>And in a language, half her own, half French,</l>
							<l>She bid them welcome. " Men who wear the cross,</l>
							<l>Within the Eagle's wigwam, rest in peace;</l>
							<l>And she, the White Swan with you, too, shall find</l>
							<l>A friend in Humming Bird. Great Heart has gone</l>
							<l>A long Moon's journey toward the setting sun;</l>
							<l>He and my brother, Little Bear, will come,</l>
							<l>When once again the wood duck feeds her young.'"</l>
							<l>" Oh, Father Gean, the tide will never turn ;"</l>
							<l>Poor Annette sighed and sank upon the ground.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Within the wigwam, many weeks she lay</l>
							<l>In wild delirium; and when at last,</l>
							<l>The fever spent itself, so weak was she,</l>
							<l>That it was spring, before she ventured forth.</l>
							<l>But now to her the past was like a dream,</l>
							<l>A dim, uncertain, half-forgotten dream ;</l>
							<l>She still remembered in a shadowy way, --</l>
							<l>For love had held its own,--Sebastian's name.</l>
							<l>And after while, when she had stronger grown,</l>
							<l>Each morn would come and sit beside the stream</l>
							<l>And watch and wait, and sometimes softly call;</l>
							<l>And in the evening when the shadows fell,</l>
							<l>The Indian maiden, Humming Bird, would come</l>
							<l>And sit beside her for a little while,</l>
							<l>Then take her hand and gently lead her home.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Spring ripened into summer, then one day</l>
							<l>The Eagle came and spoke to Father Gean.</l>
							<l>" The wood duck now, no longer feeds her young.</l>
							<l>Great Heart and Little Bear have not returned;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-053" n="55"/>

							<l>And men who have no wigwams of their own</l>
							<l>May follow on a trail that never turns.</l>
							<l>Let us go back among the islands where</l>
							<l>The few remaining of my people dwell."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Here Father Gean took up his work again</l>
							<l>And spent his days in doing kindly deeds.</l>
							<l>He toiled and taught and prayed and found at last</l>
							<l>His burden lighten and his soul at peace.</l>
							<l>Poor Annette still her constant vigil kept;</l>
							<l>And so a dozen weary years went by.</l>
							<l>The Eagle went no more upon the chase,</l>
							<l>And Father Gean no longer went his rounds;</l>
							<l>But, with their wants supplied with kindly hands,</l>
							<l>They sat and dozed beside the wigwam door.</l>
							<l>And, sitting thus one summer afternoon,</l>
							<l>There came to them a faint and far off call.</l>
							<l>The old chief heard it, lifted up his head</l>
							<l>And listened long, then muttered, "Did I dream ?"</l>
							<l>But now again from far away there came</l>
							<l>The wild victorious cry which warriors gave</l>
							<l>When safe returning from the chase or war.</l>

							<l>The Humming Bird and Annette heard and came</l>

							<l>Old Father Gean, supported by his staff.</l>

							<l>The evil message which Francisco wrote</l>
							<l>Was sent in care of Father Cavalier,</l>
							<l>A brother to LaSalle, at Montreal;</l>
							<l>But long before the letter came, it seems,</l>
							<l>The priest had taken passage back to France.</l>
							<l>But now LaSalle, returning from the West,</l>
							<l>Fresh from his explorations to the Gulf,</l>
							<l>His fortunes scattered and his rights assailed,</l>
							<l>Determined once again to see his king.</l>
							<l>Not as a mendicant who asks for alms,</l>
							<l>Nor yet to seek return for fortune spent,</l>
							<l>But with a dream --a foolish dream perhaps,</l>
							<l>And yet a dream so grand and glorious</l>
							<l>That little souls who could not see beyond</l>
							<l>The profit to be made from beaver skins</l>
							<l>Could only wonder and call him mad.--</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Had he but had his brother's itching palm,</l>
							<l>What streams of wealth he might have made his own;</l>
							<l>And from his vantage at Ft Fontenac</l>
							<l>Controlled the traffic of the inland seas</l>
							<l>And gathered more and more, until at last,</l>
							<l>He might have been a Creosus or a king;</l>
							<l>But, loyal to his country and his church,</l>
							<l>His dream was of their glory and renown.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9489-055" n="57"/>

						<lg>
							<l>While making preparations for his voyage,</l>
							<l>Among some letters, likewise overdue,</l>
							<l>He found the one that better had been lost.</l>
							<l>Now with LaSalle to Montreal had come</l>
							<l>His young Mohecan hunter, guide, and friend.</l>
							<l>For full four years and full five thousand leagues</l>
							<l>Of lake and stream and plain and forest ways,</l>
							<l>In stress and storm together they had gone;</l>
							<l>Both strong of purpose, brave and brawny men,</l>
							<l>And each a model of his type and time;</l>
							<l>Yet each beheld in all the changeful scenes</l>
							<l>That which the other had not eyes to see.</l>
							<l>White Beaver saw good feeding grounds for game</l>
							<l>And in the well-worn runways of the wood</l>
							<l>Saw signs of plenty and was satisfied.</l>
							<l>But to the Norman, ah what visions came ! </l>
							<l>The gleaming sails of commerce on the lakes,</l>
							<l>And villages and towns upon the streams</l>
							<l>And oft in fancy heard at eventide</l>
							<l>The far, faint music of the vesper bells.</l>
							<l>His dream a prophecy; and yet, alas ! </l>
							<l>For him and his no part of it came true.</l>
							<l>But now White Beaver and LaSalle had come</l>
							<l>To where their ways must part; the one to go</l>
							<l>Back to his people in the wilderness,</l>
							<l>The other first to see his king and then</l>
							<l>To meet disaster and at last his death.</l>
							<l>In the gray dawn beside the restless stream,</l>
							<l>LaSalle placed in White Beaver's trusty hand </l>
							<l>The letter to Sebastian long delayed.</l>
							<l>" Take this," he said, "to Great Heart, he who trades</l>
							<l>Among your people on the Kankakee."</l>
							<l>A clasp of hands in iron grip; and then,</l>
							<l>Without reply, the savage went his way.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>But what of him upon his lonely isle ?</l>
							<l>Impatient, yet well pleased, Sebastian toiled</l>
							<l>And saw his earnings double with each year.</l>
							<l>" Love lightens labor," is an old, old saw;</l>
							<l>But there is one I think is no less true.</l>
							<l>" A goodly profit makes our labor less;"</l>
							<l>And when both love and profit lent a hand,</l>
							<l>No wonder then Sebastian's heart was light! </l>
							<l>And ever and anon, this one refrain</l>
							<l>Kept running in his thoughts, until his lips,</l>
							<l>Unconsciously at times, would give it words,</l>
							<l>"Only one year more! Only one year more !"</l>
							<l>The traffic for the season being closed,</l>
							<l>He needs must find a market for his wares.</l>
							<l>The nearest trading post of any note</l>
							<l>Was Point St. Ignace; thitherward he went;</l>
							<l>But here found he strange rumors in the air.</l>
							<l>"LaSalle was mad; Count Fontenac recalled;</l>
							<l>LeFebvre de LaBarre ruled in his stead;</l>
							<l>And all commissions issued by La Salle</l>
							<l>Had been revoked." A danger threatened him,</l>
							<l>For should he journey on to Montreal,</l>
							<l>LaBarre would surely confiscate his goods.</l>
							<l>But fortune favored him, for by mere chance</l>
							<l>He found some traders, inexperienced men,</l>
							<l>Who, weary of their ventures and in doubt,</l>
							<l>Were glad to take his furs at double price,</l>
							<l>And pay in goods at something less than cost.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9489-057" n="59"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Oh, what delirious happiness was his !</l>
							<l>His year of exile dwindled into weeks,</l>
							<l>A little way beyond, Saut Ste. Marie,</l>
							<l>The greatest trading post in all the west,</l>
							<l>Held many traders, who would take his goods.</l>
							<l>And then -- and then he laughed in boyish glee ! </l>
							<l>That day his boatman feasted to the full.</l>
							<l>And as they slumbered; late into the night,</l>
							<l>Before the failing fagots on the hearth,</l>
							<l>He sat and mused, and as he mused, he smiled.</l>
							<l>Success was his ! And now he laughed; and then,</l>
							<l>Oh fateful words I And then White Beaver came !</l>
						</lg>



						<lg>
							<l>Why is it, when the cup of joy is full,</l>
							<l>The ready hand of griet must strike it down ?</l>
							<l>Why, down beneath the rich, red wine of hope</l>
							<l>The dregs of disappointment always lie ?</l>
							<l>And why, with sweatest pleasures we must link,</l>
							<l>The galling shackles of an after pain ?</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Among the sleeping boatmen in the hut</l>
							<l>Was Little Bear, the old Chief Eagle's son,</l>
							<l>He saw White Beaver enter and depart;</l>
							<l>He saw Sebastian read, then pause and sigh,</l>
							<l>And draw his brawny hand across his brow.</l>
							<l>Was it the smoke? And then he read again.</l>
							<l>He saw him crush the parchment in his hand,</l>
							<l>And fling it to the flames; and with a curse,</l>
							<l>His first and last, ground out between his teeth,</l>
							<l>Pass out with heavy tread into the night;</l>
							<l>And like a shadow, followed Little Bear.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9489-058" n="60"/>

						<lg>
							<l>My son, have you not seen the peaceful lake</l>
							<l>Asleep beneath a tranquil summer sky,</l>
							<l>Its margin mirrored in its crystal depths;</l>
							<l>And on the morrow looked again to see</l>
							<l>Its mad waves beat upon its stricken shore,</l>
							<l>And shriek and bellow in their senseless rage ?</l>
							<l>Of such is human life. To-day we dream,</l>
							<l>Secure in the hope the future holds;</l>
							<l>To-morrow wake to' wage a bootless war</l>
							<l>Against the jagged javelin points of fate.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>All night Sebastian paced the lonely beach;</l>
							<l>And as ever he went, a silent form,</l>
							<l>Within the friendly shelter of the wood,</l>
							<l>Kept even pace with him; but when at last</l>
							<l>With laden steps he sought the hut again,</l>
							<l>Among the boatmen slumbered Little Bear.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Alas I no mortal ever yet has trod</l>
							<l>Through all his days the pathway of his dreams ;</l>
							<l>But soon or late, somewhere upon the road,</l>
							<l>Must from the fragments of his shattered hopes</l>
							<l>Piece out the after years as best he may.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Unto Sebastian now that time had come.</l>
							<l>But weeks went by, and undecided still,</l>
							<l>He lingered at the Point, yet held aloof</l>
							<l>From traders, Indians, priests and coureurs de bois,</l>
							<l>And wandered all alone upon the beach,</l>
							<l>Or sat in gloomy silence in the hut,</l>
							<l>A sad. dejected, disappointed man.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9489-059" n="61"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Until one night a courier from the east,</l>
							<l>Beset by ambushed foes upon the way,</l>
							<l>And wounded unto death, came to the door</l>
							<l>And fell across the threshold in a swoon,</l>
							<l>And never came to consciousness again.</l>
							<l>Sebastian found a message in his hand.</l>
							<l>So travel soiled was it and stained with blood,</l>
							<l>He needs must break the seal before he found</l>
							<l>It was from Tonty and its import gave.</l>
							<l>This message must go forward with all haste.</l>
							<l>The morning dawned to find him on his way,</l>
							<l>His boatman bribed to make a given point;</l>
							<l>And thus each day with gifts for greater speed,</l>
							<l>He urged them on. And as he went he planned.</l>
							<l>Tne past was past More wealth he did not crave;</l>
							<l>But there were left his country and his king;</l>
							<l>And in their service, he at least might win</l>
							<l>The peace and quiet of a nameless grave.</l>
							<l>No time was wasted at his trading post,</l>
							<l>And he and Little Bear set out alone.</l>
							<l>At Fort St. Louis for a time he served</l>
							<l>As scout and hunter; then with Tonty went</l>
							<l>On that long fruitless search to find LaSalle.</l>
							<l>But when at last their prows were homeward turned</l>
							<l>He had no heart to toil against the tide;</l>
							<l>Ambition had no hope to feed upon;</l>
							<l>Here in the wilderness he would remain,</l>
							<l>If not forgetting, then at least forgot.</l>
							<l>He went to Tonty and made known his wish;</l>
							<l>And Tonty gave him quittance; and he stayed,</l>
							<l>Year after year he drifted here and there,</l>
							<l>Until one night a missionary came,</l>
							<l>And asked the comfort of his camp till dawn.</l>
							<l>They sat and talked till far into the night.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-060" n="62"/>

							<l>The kind loquacious priest had much to tell;</l>
							<l>How he had crossed the portage, and had found</l>
							<l>Old Father Gean upon the Kankakee;</l>
							<l>And all unconscious, told the story through.</l>
							<l>But ere the tale was ended Little Bear</l>
							<l>Arose and went in silence to the stream,</l>
							<l>Launched his canoe, placed in it food, and stood</l>
							<l>A statue on the shore; until at last</l>
							<l>Sebastian cried, " Good Father, I must go !</l>
							<l>I am the man they seek, and I must go !"</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>I see the picture, but I cannot paint</l>
							<l>The meeting on that summer afternoon;</l>
							<l>The Eagle's stolid greeting of his son;</l>
							<l>The old priest's blessing and his fervent prayer;</l>
							<l>Poor Annette's childlike wonder and the sad</l>
							<l>And the silent Humming Bird, and in their midst</l>
							<l>A bronzed and bearded man, who strove to hide</l>
							<l>From savage eyes the anguish of his soul.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Till late that night besides the old priest's couch,</l>
							<l>Sebastian sat and listened. Father Gean,</l>
							<l>Reserving nothing, told the story through.</l>
							<l>" Now leave me for awhile," the old priest said,</l>
							<l>" But with to-morrow come, and if you can,</l>
							<l>Then say to me, my son, that you forgive."</l>
							<l>Sebastian took the palsied hand and pressed</l>
							<l>It gently in his own broad palms and said,</l>
							<l>" I need not wait the morrow, Father Green."</l>
							<l>Then out into the night he went, and walked</l>
							<l>The gloomy forest depths until the dawn,</l>
							<l>And in the morning when he came again,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9489-061" n="63"/>

							<l>A smile was on the old priest's withered lips,</l>
							<l>A cross lay on his breast, and he had slipped</l>
							<l>Into that long, untroubled, dreamless sleep.</l>
							<l>What followed in the after years, it seems</l>
							<l>No one can tell; but still a legend runs:</l>
							<l>How hunters often on this island saw</l>
							<l>A woman, old and gray, who seemed to seek</l>
							<l>For something she had lost, but could not find;</l>
							<l>And with her always as she came and went,</l>
							<l>An Indian woman, older yet than she.</l>
							<l>And to this day, that lonely spot is called</l>
							<l>" White Woman's Island." This same legend tells</l>
							<l>How here among the natives years ago,</l>
							<l>A sad faced white man spent his latter days.</l>
							<l>But whether Annette and Sebastian here</l>
							<l>Lived out their lives, my grandsire did not know."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Such is the story which the old man told.</l>
							<l>How much of it is true I do not know;</l>
							<l>And then, in truth, it may be wholly false;</l>
							<l>But there is something left by way of proof;</l>
							<l>For take these vines from that one little isle</l>
							<l>And plant them where you will; strange it may seem,</l>
							<l>But naught of vintage will the years produce,</l>
							<l>And after while, they yellow with the blight;</l>
							<l>For Hilda's charm and Hilda's curse still hold.</l>

						<l>In a soothing undertone,</l>
						<l>I forget the day and its doings</l>
						<l>The morrow with all its care,</l>
						<l>For my thoughts will stray in a vagrant way,</l>
						<l>And my soul is otherwhere,</l>

						<l>And again to me comes the laughter</l>

					<lg>

					<lg>
						<l>All that,season and the next one,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Half in earnest, half in jest,</l>
						<l>Each one tried to beat the other,</l>

						<l>But a fogy may have ideas, which have not gone to seed,</l>
						<l>With now and then some good advice that's worth your while to heed.</l>
						<l>And I can't help sometimes thinking, there are some things now-a-days,</l>
						<l>That would be the better patterned after good old-fashioned ways;</l>
						<l>For I know that with the changes, which the years have brought about</l>
						<l>There were some things worth the keeping, that have somehow faded out.</l>
						<l>Friendship now is not as hearty, nor our sympathy as free,</l>
						<l>And the world is growing colder since the days that used to be:</l>
						<l>Then our little world was narrowed to a single neighborhood</l>
						<l>And our neighbors always neighbored; the evil and the good,</l>
						<l>Which came to one was shared by all; each marriage, death or birth;</l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-069" n="71"/>

						<l>Awoke our kindly interest; our sadness and our mirth</l>
						<l>Were held as common property; that kinship now is less,</l>
						<l>And in its stead are jealousy and pride and selfishness.</l>
						<l>Your fast trains and your daily press bring the world's woe to your door,</l>
						<l>But the latch-string seldom dangles on the outside any more.</l>
						<l>Oh! those happy days ere Mammon made us slaves to greed and gain,</l>
						<l>When our roadway like a ribbon wound across the verdant plain</l>
						<l>And a sense of boundless freedom made our hearts to overflow,</l>
						<l>And our eyes beheld a beauty which you youngsters do not know,</l>
						<l>Who have grown up with the custom, which in your day confines</l>
						<l>Your travel to the highways now laid outonsection lines.</l>
						<l>Ah! full many a real pleasure and full many a joy have fled,</l>
						<l>Since the day when first the carriage left the wagon in the shed.</l>
						<l>True our labor then was harder than the work you have to do,</l>
						<l>But we never lacked for muscle, nor the will to put it through;</l>
						<l>We didn't pile up dollars like you folks are doing now;</l>
						<l>But we weren't so over anxious for great riches anyhow;</l>
						<l>And our wants were not so many, for our vanity was less.</l>
						<l>Then each maiden went to meeting in a linsey, woolsey dress;</l>
						<l>And her beau was dressed in homespun, and their love was homespun too;</l>
						<l>And divorces weren't the fashion as they seem to be with you.</l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-070" n="72"/>

						<l>But I would not have you youngsters think, that just because I find,</l>
						<l>There are some things worth the keeping that have somehow dropped behind,</l>
						<l>That I hold the good as worthless, that I find along the way,</l>
						<l>Or think the world had not progressed, since that far off yesterday.</l>
						<l>But the past to me is sacred, and old memories will come</l>
						<l>With a rush of recollections of a humble cabin home;</l>
						<l>And somehow I can't help thinking, for it sometimes seems to me,</l>
						<l>That love to-day is not as true as what it used to be;</l>
						<l> For it seems that little cabin held at least an hundred-fold</l>
						<l>More of genuine affection, than your stately mansions hold.</l>
						<l>But forgive an old man's prattle and forget his childish tears;</l>
						<l>For mine eyes have gathered moisture from the mist of many years;</l>
						<l>And the sunlight falls so slanting from the western sky to-day,</l>
						<l>That my vision seems the clearer when I look the other way.</l>
						<l> My ambition lights no beacons on the future's purple slopes,</l>
						<l>And my fancy finds no embers in the ashes of my hopes;</l>
						<l>And I am only waiting with a faith that comforts me</l>
						<l>For the welcome of the Master to the life that is to be,</l>
						<l>Where no change gives birth to sadness, where our hopes we may renew,</l>
						<l>Where our love is all completeness, and our dreams will all come true.</l>

					<head rend="center">A COMMON-PLACE STORY.</head>

					<lg>
						<l>I will tell you a story, my friends, but I fear</l>
						<l>It is such a common-place story, that here</l>
						<l>Is hardly the place for a story Ikie mine.</l>
						<l>We like to hear something that cheers us like wine,</l>
						<l>Of valorous deeds done for truth and for right,</l>
						<l>But mine is a common-place story, to-night,</l>
						<l>Let us say, of a woman. Light-hearted was she,</l>
						<l>In the days of her girlhood, as blithesome and free</l>
						<l>As the birds that carroled about her. Her face,</l>
						<l>Not handsome, perhaps, but touched with a grace,</l>
						<l>Which mirrored a heart that was honest and true.</l>
						<l>Untrained and untrammeled to womanhood grew</l>
						<l>This wild rose, which bloomed in the forest's dim ways,</l>
						<l>Where few came to flatter, and none came to praise.</l>
						<l>Until one came at last, and whispered, -- Ah! well,</l>
						<l>The old, old sweet story, the hardest to tell.</l>
						<l>Then life was a poem, and love was the theme --</l>
						<l>A grave in the valley -- thus ended her dream.</l>
						<l>And she took up the burden of life, and went on;</l>
						<l>And the years came and went until twenty had gone;</l>
						<l>And the world did not know, for the world does not heed.</l>
						<l>When heart wounds are hidden, how long they may bleed.</l>
						<l>She lived not for self. Through this long drift of years,</l>
						<l>She smiled with the happy and mingled her tears</l>
						<l>With the tears of the mourners. But love came no more,</l>
						<l>The all-beautiful dream of her girlhood was o'er.</l>
						<l>A middle-aged woman, -- the shuttle of care</l>
						<l>Was weaving white threads in the gloss of her hair.</l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-072" n="74"/>

						<l>And the pencil of time was beginning to trace</l>
						<l>Its unwelcome lines on her yet comely face;</l>
						<l>When a man of some wealth, a widower, came</l>
						<l>And offered his hand, and his home, and his name.</l>
						<l>She told him her story; he listened, then pled</l>
						<l>For the sake of the love which for both now was dead,</l>
						<l>They could live for each other, both needed a home,</l>
						<l>His was only a house, and would she not come?</l>
						<l>And she went; and for him and for his she toiled on,</l>
						<l>And the years came and went until twenty had gone.</l>
						<l>His children had married and each gone their way,</l>
						<l>When a letter, black bordered, was opened one day,</l>
						<l>Which told in brief words how the wife of a son</l>
						<l>Had sickened and died, and oh! what could be done</l>
						<l>For his motherless children? Thus the note read.</l>
						<l>She thought for a moment, then quietly said,</l>
						<l>"Just tell him to bring all his children to me."</l>
						<l>And the old house was filled as it once used to be;</l>
						<l>And the patter of feet on the bare oaken floor</l>
						<l>And shouts in the orchard re-echoed once more.</l>
						<l>'Til a new home was found and they all went away,</l>
						<l>Save one, for she begged that her Willie might stay.</l>
						<l>And he staid, and for him to the end she toiled on,</l>
						<l>And the years came and went, until thirty have gone,</l>
						<l>Since she went to the rest, which her labors had earned</l>
						<l>Where a love such as her's, perhaps, is returned.</l>
						<l>Oh! the infinite love, which she lavished on him!</l>
						<l>And he wonders sometimes, if those eyes old and dim</l>
						<l>Did not fancy they saw in his form, or could trace</l>
						<l>Some likeness in his, to that long-vanished face.</l>
						<l>But, my friends, my common-place story is done.</l>
						<l>It were better, perhaps, had I never begun,</l>
						<l>But I was her Willie, and so it may be</l>
						<l>Something more than a common-place story to me!</l>

					<lg>
						<l>I am weary to-night, and fain would I creep</l>
						<l>Up into the loft, where I once used to sleep,</l>
						<l>And leave, as I climbed up the old creaking stair,</l>
						<l>At its foot all my burden of worry and care;</l>
						<l>And turn back the blankets and old-fashioned spread,</l>
						<l>And hide from the world, in the old feather bed.</l>
					</lg>



					<lg>
						<l>Oh, the old feather bed! how its folds seemed to press</l>
						<l>'Round my play-wearied body with warmest caress!</l>
						<l>And I drifted away on its billows in dreams</l>
						<l>Of a rose-tinted future. Alas ! now it seems</l>
						<l>That the pain in my heart, and the ache in my head</l>
						<l>Would be soothed, could I rest on the old feather bed.</l>
					</lg>



					<lg>
						<l>I have tried the wide world, I have tasted its cheer,</l>
						<l>And much have I found that is precious and dear;</l>
						<l>But much that was priceless, is faded and gone --</l>
						<l>And folly too often has beckoned me on --</l>
						<l>And l long to go back through the years that have fled,</l>
						<l>And forget, for one night, on the old feather bed.</l>

						<l>How I wish I could strip by the old fire-place,</l>
						<l>And stand, as I used to, and warm for a space,</l>
						<l>Then muster up courage, and plunge up the stair,</l>
						<l>In the gloom of the night and the frost ladened air,</l>
						<l>And turn down the covers 'mid shivers and dread,</l>
						<l>And dive to the depths of the old feather bed!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>But I would not go back unless I could know</l>
						<l>I would hear on the stairs, a step labored and slow,</l>
						<l>And see a bent form, as beside me she stands,</l>
						<l>And feel the soft touch of her gentle old hands,</l>
						<l>As she smooths down the pillow about my young head,</l>
						<l>And tucks me in, snug in the old feather bed.</l>

					<head rend="center">NOW, AS GOOD AS ANY TIME.</head>


					<lg>
						<l>I have noticed that the poet,</l>
						<l>With a retrospective view,</l>
						<l>Seldom ever writes a poem</l>
						<l>That is altogether true.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>And for once I am determined</l>
						<l>To correct this glaring fault;</l>
						<l>Sprinkle facts among my fancies,</l>
						<l>As we season soup with salt.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Let my theme be happy boyhood</l>
						<l>With its wayward, willful ways;</l>
						<l>Let me call up recollections</l>
						<l> Of those almost perfect days.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>When the bloom was on the clover</l>
						<l>And our hearts were light and free --</l>
						<l>And we made our first acquaintance</l>
						<l>With the burley bumble-bee.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Or perhaps, to put it stronger,</l>
						<l>When we came out second best</l>
						<l>In a rough and tumble wrestle</l>
						<l>With a yellow jacket's nest.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-079" n="81"/>

					<lg>
						<l>How the June days smiled upon us!</l>
						<l>How we often used to steal!</l>
						<l>To the swimming hole on Sunday --</l>
						<l> With a stone-bruise on the heel.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>How we rollicked in the water!</l>
						<l>How we reveled in the sand! --</l>
						<l>But our welcome home at evening</l>
						<l>Wasn't altogether grand.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>Oh! the plum trees in the thickets! --</l>
						<l> Oh! the orchards on the hills!--</l>
						<l>And the colic and the doctor</l>
						<l>With his castor oil and pills.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>Oh! the berries in the brambles,</l>
						<l>Which this lesson seemed to teach,</l>
						<l>That the thing we prize the highest,</l>
						<l> Is the one we cannot reach.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>Oh! the chestnut in the autumn,</l>
						<l>When the burrs begin to burst!--</l>
						<l>And we found the other fellow</l>
						<l>Was the one who got there first.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>Thus a hundred pleasing fancies</l>
						<l> Crowd upon my thoughts to-day,</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Midsummer lays her spell upon the wood,</l>
						<l>And Nature now seems sadly out of tune,</l>
						<l>For songsters in the sultry heat of noon,</l>
						<l>Wake scarce one note in all the neighborhood.</l>
						<l>In vain I linger now where once I stood,</l>
						<l> And listened to the melodies of June;</l>
						<l> Alas! that all the songful world so soon</l>
						<l>Should sink into this silent, sober mood!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>The fields have lost their wealth of golden grain,</l>
						<l>And gone are all the rows of tented sheaves,</l>
						<l> For creaking homeward late on dewy eves,</l>
						<l>Too oft has come the heavy laden wain; </l>
						<l>And all night long the Katydids complain,</l>
						<l> And through the evening late the cticket grieves.</l>
						<l>And unmolested now the spider weaves</l>
						<l>O'er stubble tops his silken strands again.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>A splash of crimson and a glint of gold,</l>
						<l>Along the zigzag fence rows tell the tale.</l>
						<l>That soon -- too soon -- will summer's splendor pale,</l>
						<l>And with each day will autumn grow more bold --</l>
						<l>Alas! to me the signs are manifold.</l>
						<l> Nor from the voice of Nature do I fail</l>

					<lg>
						<l>The silv'ry rim of a brand new moon</l>
						<l>Was tangled in tree-tops low in the west,</l>
						<l>The Kadydid voices were all in tune,</l>
						<l>And the cricket fiddlers were at their best;</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>The stars were thick on the milky way,</l>
						<l>The Brownies had sprinkled the grass with dew,</l>
						<l>While over the meadow in vagrant play,</l>
						<l>Came the idlest wind that ever blew;</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>When a poet went forth, as poets will,</l>
						<l>To rhyme and to dream in some lonely dell;</l>
						<l>And he rhymed, and he dreamed, and wrote until</l>
						<l>Some very strange stories he had to tell.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>How the bull-frog tuning his banjo string</l>
						<l>Said "the tree-toad tittered and laughed at him,</l>
						<l>But the tree-toad said, it was no such thing,</l>
						<l>He was only putting his voice in trim."</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>For it hadn't rained for a month or more</l>
						<l>And he couldn't give any reason why,</l>
						<l>For hadn't he called till his throat was sore?</l>
						<l>But still there wasn't a cloud in the sky.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-083" n="85"/>

					<lg>
						<l>Then the bull-frog said, "You'd better go round</l>
						<l>And get Mr. Rain-crow to help you call,</l>
						<l>For if you don't do it, then I'll be bound,</l>
						<l>We won't get a shower till way next fall."</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>How the raccoon dandy, who wears more rings</l>
						<l>Than any fine lady in the land,</l>
						<l>And seems to be always grinning at things,</l>
						<l>Said to Madam O'Possum, "I understand</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>You always carry your cradle with you,</l>
						<l>No matter, 'tis said, wherever you go."</l>
						<l>Said, Madam O'Possum, "Oh, yes, 'tis true</l>
						<l>My babies are in it, I'd have you know."</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>How the owl high up in the old oak tree,</l>
						<l>Whose sight is so poor, though he has big eyes,</l>
						<l>And stutters so badly, 'tis strange to me,</l>
						<l>That any one ever should call him wise.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>Kept asking the question, "Who, who are you?"</l>
						<l>But nobody answered, for it is plain,</l>
						<l>An impudent question, the whole world through</l>
						<l>Will wait for an answer, and wait in vain.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>These are some of the things which the poet saw,</l>
						<l>And a few, perhaps, that he dreamed he heard,</l>
						<l>But readers, remember there is no law,</l>
						<l>To keep you from doubting a poet's word.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Can you tell me your aim in life, my boy?</l>
						<l>Is it to seek pleasure which soon will cloy;</l>
						<l>That loses it charm when we lose our youth,</l>
						<l>And burdens the heart with its rue and ruth?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Is it sowing the fields and reaping the grain,</l>
						<l>Then plowing and sowing and reaping again,</l>
						<l>Through a long, monotonous round until</l>
						<l>The heart wears out, and the hands are still?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Is it hunting and hoarding the yellow dross,</l>
						<l>And counting the time as an utter loss</l>
						<l>If it bring no gain to your worldly store?</l>
						<l>Ah, surely your purpose is something more!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>For sowing the fields and reaping the grain,</l>
						<l>And every endeavor for honest gain,</l>
						<l>Should only be methods which we pursue</l>
						<l>To some higher aim, which we have in view.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>For our purpose in life should ever rise</l>
						<l>From the grov'ling earth to azure skies;</l>
						<l>From the selfish greed of a sordid heart,</l>
						<l>To a nobler, grander, and better part.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Here's to the boy who is country born!</l>
						<l>Who weeds the onions and hoes the corn,</l>
						<l>Fodders the flock and waters the drove,</l>
						<l>And cuts the wood for the kitchen stove;</l>
						<l>Carries the water and empties swill,</l>
						<l>And grinds the grist on the coffee mill;</l>
						<l>And has a dozen more chores to do --</l>
						<l>I say, young fellow, here is to you</l>
						<l>You may be fat or you may be lean,</l>
						<l>Your city cousin may call you "green,"</l>
						<l>Your face so freckled it cannot tan;</l>
						<l>You may be built on an awkward plan,</l>
						<l>And common the kind of clothes you wear,</l>
						<l>But I know the kind of boy you are;</l>
						<l>And I have known many of just your style,</l>
						<l>And even worse, who, after a while,</l>
						<l>Plodding along at a sturdy pace,</l>
						<l>Have plodded up to a high place.</l>
						<l>You some times envy the city chap,</l>
						<l>And think he's the one who has the "snap,"</l>
						<l>But I tell you, 'tis as true as truth</l>
						<l>It is not you but the city youth,</l>
						<l>Who has not half of a good fair show,</l>
						<l>For you have plenty of room to grow.</l>
						<l>You think sometimes as you dig and sweat,</l>
						<l>You work pretty hard for what you get,</l>
						<l>But with the muscle and nerve and bone,</l>
						<l>And the self-reliance, all your own.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-090" n="92"/>

						<l>Which after while you surely will need,</l>
						<l>You can count yourself well paid, indeed.</l>
						<l>And say, my lad, will you name out right</l>
						<l>The price you put on your appetite?</l>
						<l>For many a city man would pay</l>
						<l>Whatever price you may ask, to-day.</l>
						<l>Yes, pay in dollars of good hard gold,</l>
						<l>More than your pockets and hat would hold.</l>
						<l>Oh, country boy! May your bare brown feet</l>
						<l>Long be strange to the city street.</l>
						<l>But may they tread in the peaceful ways</l>
						<l>Of a country life through all your days.</l>

					<head rend="center"> THE LEGEND OF THE LADY SLIPPER.</head>


					<lg>
						<l>Long, long ago I heard hale housewives say --</l>
						<l> "That fairies lingered in each shady dell,"</l>
						<l>But now it seems they all have gone away,</l>
						<l>And this the legend, good old grand dames tell:</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Once Fay, the fairy queen, though fancy free,</l>
						<l>Was courted by the prince of goblins, Rex,</l>
						<l>But though a prince and one of high degree</l>
						<l>In goblin land, his wooings did but vex</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>The fairy queen; thrice did tell him nay,</l>
						<l>And yet her way toward him was not unkind,</l>
						<l>How like a woman was this fairy Fay!</l>
						<l>How like a man was Rex! How blind!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Still bent on winning her he tried to please,</l>
						<l>By sending presents from the silk worm's loom,</l>
						<l>And sweetest bon bons which the bumble bees</l>
						<l>Filch through long summer days from clover bloom;</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>And filmy fabrics fashioned from the strands</l>
						<l>Which spiders spin upon the stubbles brown,</l>
						<l>And softest cushions made by elfin hands</l>
						<l>From whitest milkweed and the thistle down.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-092" n="94"/>

					<lg>
						<l>But all in vain, his presents were returned --</l>
						<l>All save the bon bons -- Oh, how Rex did rave! </l>
						<l>A fierce and fiery hate within him burned,</l>
						<l>And then he vowed that Fay should be his slave.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>And calling all his minions, bade them hide</l>
						<l>In ev'ry dell and ev'ry gloomy glen</l>
						<l>And wait until the fairy queen they spied,</l>
						<l>Then carry her captive to the fen</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>Wherein he held his court, and captive too,</l>
						<l>And in a trice was ev'ry goblin hid,</l>
						<l>Each midget monster to his prince was true,</l>
						<l>And hastened all, to do as they were bid.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>And Fay, the fairy queen, that evening late,</l>
						<l>Well mounted on her steed, the dragon-fly,</l>
						<l>Still all unconscious of her hapless fate,</l>
						<l>In merry mood went riding gayly by.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>When all at once a goblin sprang at her,</l>
						<l>While in pursuit came all the yelping band,</l>
						<l>Though she escaped by using whip and spur,</l>
						<l>She left one slipper in the goblin's hand.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>But fairy slippers have a magic charm,</l>
						<l>So I am told, but whether true or not,</l>
						<l>This slipper wrought the goblins woeful harm:</l>
						<l>And changed them all to nettles on the spot.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-093" n="95"/>

					<lg>
						<l>This legend may be true, for I have found,</l>
						<l>Where nettles grow, there fairies do not dwell.</l>
						<l>And little lady-slippers most abound</l>
						<l>Among the nettles in each shady dell.</l>

						<l>She't get there somehow; and she's got there, but well,</l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-095" n="97"/>

						<l>That is the story that I started to tell.</l>
						<l>Well, 'long with her pryin' in curious nooks,</l>
						<l>She got in the habit o' peekin' in books.</l>
						<l>School house a mile an' three-quarters away,</l>
						<l>But Marg wuz jest bound to go ever' day.</l>
						<l>Ust to work her sums, at home of a night,</l>
						<l>An' the ole man grumbled about the light.</l>
						<l>Said some things, I reckon, he didn't quite mean;</l>
						<l>Fer he 'lowed she uz wastin' the kerosene;</l>
						<l>But her mother, she says, "Now, Pap, keep still.</l>
						<l>Let the child figger her sums ef she will."</l>
						<l>The upshot of it wuz, at about sixteen</l>
						<l>There wuzn't a sum enywhere in between</l>
						<l>The lids 'o Ray's third part she couldn't do:</l>
						<l>An' she'd parsed her grammer book through an' through;</l>
						<l>Had Uncle Sam's doing's, nigh up to date,</l>
						<l>An' Cutter hisself would a-called her great.</l>
						<l>An' her ole mother -- she wuz jest that proud!</l>
						<l>'Done middlin' well,' the ole man a'lowed.</l>
						<l>But she purt nigh took his breath away,</l>
						<l>When she come a-coaxin' o' him one day</l>
						<l>Fer to let her go off to school, somewhur,</l>
						<l>An' she wanted to go a plum whole yer!</l>
						<l>The ole man he balked; but her mother said,</l>
						<l>A-talkin' to him when Marg wuz in bed,</l>
						<l>"Hit 'pears to me, Pap, that we can a'ford</l>
						<l>To let the child go ef she works fer her board."</l>
						<l>An' so it turned out, in the fall she went down</l>
						<l>An' put in a yer at the county seat town.</l>
						<l>With the ole man tryin' his level best --</l>
						<l>Mushrats an' coons didn't get any rest.</l>
						<l>"Hits the ole woman's doin's,' he ust to say.</l>
						<l>An' these varmints have got them 'ere bills to pay." </l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-096" n="98"/>

						<l>Well, when Marg got back with a license to teach,</l>
						<l>The ole woman's pride, it went clean out o' reach!</l>
						<l>All the ole man said wuz, "I'm glad she's through!"</l>
						<l>Then Marg kep school fer a yer or two,</l>
						<l>An' folks sort o' 'lowed she'd marry; but</l>
						<l>There's a place down here they call Terre Hut,</l>
						<l>Down on the Wabash, below Perryville,</l>
						<l>Some kind of a school down there, where they drill</l>
						<l>Folks in the way o' school teachin', ye know.</l>
						<l>Well, nothin' ud do but Marg she must go.</l>

						<l>To help Marg stay there fer to graduate.</l>
						<l>An' she done it someway, but how, I 'spose</l>
						<l>They ain't anybody but her 'at knows.</l>
						<l>The tickledest woman 'at ever you see!</l>
						<l>An' I ain't disputin' her right to be.</l>
						<l>"Now," says the ole man, "I reckon she's done."</l>
						<l>But there's a place down here called Bloomington.</l>
						<l>South here a piece on the ole Salem Road</l>
						<l>There's a school down there that's jest growedan'growed</l>

					<head rend="center"> THE LITTLE FRAME SCHOOL HOUSE.</head>

					<lg>
						<l>Oh the little frame school house that stands on the hill!</l>
						<l>There's a sway in its roof tree, a sag in each sill.</l>
						<l>Its old-fashioned chimney has crumbled away,</l>
						<l>And each clapboard and shingle with lichen is gray.</l>
						<l>Now a tangle of brambles forbidding and dense,</l>
						<l>Fills the pathway which led from the house to the fence,</l>
						<l>And the mullen grows rank in the long narrow lane,</l>
						<l>And its play ground to-day is a desert of grain.</l>
						<l>But I push through the brambles and enter the door,</l>
						<l>Ah! The dust of neglect gathers deep on the floor;</l>
						<l>The rude benches are gone, and the master's high stool,</l>
						<l>Where so often I sat as the dunce of the school,</l>
						<l>Now has only one leg. But the desks that were placed</l>
						<l>The full length of the room, and each rudely defaced</l>
						<l>With jack-knife and barlow are there to proclaim</l>
						<l>The first efforts of many in carving a name.</l>
						<l>Oh how much of the past each rude effort recalls!</l>
						<l>And I hang up old pictures to-day on these walls.</l>
						<l>From just over his desk, the old master looks down,</l>
						<l>With a smile on his lips, on his forehead a frown,</l>
						<l>Half his sterness expressed, half his kindness concealed.</l>
						<l>But the half that was hidden his patience revealed;</l>
						<l>Though his book lore was scanty, his muscle was good,</l>
						<l>And the methods he used were the best understood.</l>
						<l>Thus my fancy goes back through the drift of dead years,</l>
						<l>Until 'round me I see through the mist of my tears,</l>
						<l>All the young happy faces familiar to me;</l>
						<l>But I turn from these pictures of pathos to see </l>

						<l>Another far better and brighter and true,</l>
						<l>Would that I were a painter to paint it for you --</l>
						<l>For out of this doorway an army has gone,</l>
						<l>An army of progress, that moves the world on,</l>
						<l>And up from the depths it has lifted our State,</l>
						<l>Till few dare to say they are nearly as great.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>There stands in the valley, a structure of stone,</l>
						<l>Far grander, more stately than this I must own,</l>
						<l>That army has built it, a monument still,</l>

					<head rend="center">THE MAN FROM TERRE HUT.</head>


					<lg>
						<l>Sometime ago, I think, perhaps, about a week before</l>
						<l>Our school was out, that some of us were down at Ross' store,</l>
						<l>And there we fell to talking first of this, and then of that,</l>
						<l>And having in a general way, a sort of social chat --</l>
						<l>We talked of local politics, and candidates, and then</l>
						<l>We criticised the President, and other public men;</l>
						<l>We bragged about our churches,and eulogized our preachers,</l>
						<l>And wound up with an estimate upon our schools and teachers.</l>
						<l>When some one said that teaching was a woman's work he guessed,</l>
						<l>But another was as certain that a man could teach the best.</l>
						<l>And the deacon "kinder reckoned the new fangled ways they had</l>
						<l>Wuz enough to make it certain that the best of it is bad.</l>
						<l>Fer if they ain't behind the times, then I'ud like to know,</l>
						<l>Why youngsters now adays can't learn like forty ye'rs ago?"</l>
						<l>The deacon filled and "lit" his pipe and waited a reply,</l>
						<l> And the squire said he "reckoned" he could tell the reason why;</l>
						<l>"If ye lay aside yer prejudice," said he, "I think you'll find,</l>
						<l>That the children that our fathers raised was of a smarter kind."</l>
						<l>Then a traveling man from Terre Haute, who looks for trade out here,</l>
						<l>Spoke up and said: "Good citizens, I don't want to interfere</l>
						<l>With your pleasant conversation, but it often seems to me,</l>
						<l>That boys and girls are brighter now than what we use to be,</l>
						<l>We forget sometimes how little there was need for us to know,</l>
						<l>The old machine was run by steam, and jogged along quite slow.</l>
						<l>But now the world has quickened to a sort of lightning speed,</l>
						<l>And much our boys must learn to-day we didn't know the need,</l>
						<l>Or if we found a use for it, we learned it day by day,</l>
						<l>By the labratory method, in a scientific way.</l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-103" n="105"/>

						<l>We forget sometimes our schooling has been keeping pace with years.</l>
						<l>There is logic in our losses, there is rhetoric in our tears,</l>
						<l>There's a sort of mental science which experience has brought,</l>
						<l>That our schools have never mastered, that our teachers never taught;</l>
						<l>The geography of travel; the arithmetic of trade;</l>
						<l> And the pages of our history which we older men have made,</l>
						<l> Are the lessons we've been learning with but little time for play,</l>
						<l>And with scarcely one vacation since that first commencement day,</l>
						<l>When we left the old log school house just as full of self conceit,</l>
						<l> As the graduates from college, that to-day we often meet;</l>
						<l> And we do wrong comparing boys and what they ought to know</l>
						<l>With boys who thought they knew it all some forty years ago.</l>
						<l>And although a foreign folly, or again a native fad,</l>
						<l>That is little short of worthless it not altogether bad,</l>
						<l>Like the whooping cough or measles has its run among our schools,</l>

						<l> The doctrine that is sound will live; the foolish fads will die.</l>
						<l> And although the old log school house holds for me a potent charm,</l>
						<l>And with love for those who gathered there my heart is ever warm,</l>
						<l>Though it had a noble mission, yet he surely must be blind,</l>
						<l>Wao cannot see that long ago, we left it far behind,</l>
						<l>And our schools to-day are better than they used to be by far.</l>
						<l>Why! our poorest now are equal to the best before the war."</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Is it worth while, I wonder, to toil the live long day,</l>
						<l>And plan, and plan, till the turn of the night? Does it pay ?</l>
						<l>If all a man wants is a supper and bed, it may.</l>
						<l>But shall my dole be measured to me,by each day's need?</l>
						<l>Am I an ox, must I work all my life for my feed?</l>
						<l>Train to the yoke, a few more slaves, for the mill of greed!</l>
						<l>Then die and be food for the worms, and turn into mould!</l>
						<l>-- Discarded before I am dead, because I am old, --</l>
						<l>Insulted with alms by men who give nothing but gold!</l>
						<l>Is it worth while, I say, is it worth while, planning ways,</l>
						<l>Contriving, striving, for others than mine, all my days,</l>
						<l>All for a beggar's meed, and never a word of praise?</l>
						<l>But if a man lacks money, is he therefore a knave?</l>
						<l>Is there not more than gold to be gained, this side the grave?</l>
						<l>Does wealth, as wealth, exalt a man, or its lack deprave?</l>
						<l>Nay! for the greatest, and best, have come of lowly birth.</l>
						<l> They who ennoble, uplift, and enlighten the earth,</l>
						<l>Pay small heed to rewards, and count as of little worth</l>
						<l>That which the meanest of men may hoard, and the foolish spend,</l>
						<l>Counting, if counting at all, only a means to an end;</l>
						<l>Striving for something to give, never for something to lend:</l>
						<l>Paying small heed to the world, whether it smiles or scorns,</l>
						<l>Whether its gift is a laurel wreath, or crown of thorns,</l>
						<l> If only the priceless jewel, truth, their work adorns!</l>
						<l>Then if the world ignore, and fail to pay what I earn,</l>
						<l>Is it a matter to rail about, and show concern?</l>
						<l>If only the lessons I would teach, the learners learn!</l>

					<head rend="center">REVISED OPINIONS.</head>

					<lg>
						<l>I have had my fling at the doctors</l>
						<l>In the way of rather rude jokes --;</l>
						<l>I have grumbled and growled when I paid their bill</l>
						<l>Pretty much like other folks.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I have voiced opinions quite freely</l>
						<l>In language not over polite,</l>
						<l>But I want to take back some things I've said</l>
						<l>And apologize to-night.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>The opinions we form at twenty</l>
						<l>At fifty we often revise.</l>
						<l>Age sees more clearly through glasses it seems</l>
						<l>Than youth with its younger eyes. </l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Then I saw not the good comingled</l>
						<l>With the evil, but now I find</l>
						<l>That it runs like a thread of pure gold</l>
						<l>Through the warp of all mankind.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>And I see through the good, the evil;</l>
						<l>Through the evil, the good I trace;</l>
						<l>And both may be graven upon the heart</l>
						<l>Or written upon the face.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-116" n="118"/>

					<lg>
						<l>But I hold to this one conclusion</l>
						<l>For it seems to be sound and true;</l>
						<l>Men should always be judged by what they are,</l>
						<l>And doctors by what they do.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>I knew a doctor, who called himself</l>
						<l>Electric -- whatever that is --</l>
						<l>He was pretty much of a gentleman,</l>
						<l>And yet one grave fault was his.</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>He had a great passion for betting,</l>
						<l>And I hated his gambling ways;</l>
						<l>But along last autumn one ugly night</l>
						<l>When Hugh Gordon's team of grays</l>
					</lg>



					<lg>
						<l>Ran off the Bridge at Berry's Bend</l>
						<l>And left Hugh on a ledge of stones,</l>
						<l>Where he lay all night in a senseless heap</l>
						<l>Of bruises and broken bones,</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>This doctor came out and patched him up;</l>
						<l>And I asked in regard to Hugh;</l>
						<l>"There's about one chance in twenty," he said,</l>
						<l>"But I bet I pull him through."</l>
					</lg>


					<lg>
						<l>He did, and so I have modified</l>
						<l>My opinion somewhat since then.</l>
						<l>A doctor should always bet on himself</l>
						<l>'Gainst odds for the lives of men.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-117" n="119"/>

					<lg>
						<l>I knew another, an "allopath,"</l>
						<l>Though he never took a degree,</l>
						<l>He would swear like the army in Flanders</l>
						<l>And some times go on a spree.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Uncultured, and coarse, and rude, and rough</l>
						<l>I detested him I must own,</l>
						<l>But remember, I only knew the man,</l>
						<l>The doctor was still unknown,</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Till I saw him besides the cradle,</l>
						<l>Where a little child tossed in pain,</l>
						<l>And his touch had a woman's tenderness</l>
						<l>And his words were not profane.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>So I hold to this one opinion</l>
						<l>For it seems to be sound and true,</l>
						<l>Men should always be judged by what they are,</l>
						<l>And doctors by what they do.</l>

						<l>Shines down on a people, united and free;</l>
						<l>No foes from without dare dishonor that flag,</l>

						<l>He who in all the various walks of life,</l>

					<lg>
						<l>It has been long -- so long ago --</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">How many years, I quite forget,</l>
						<l>And how and where I do not know,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Nor by what chance it was we met;</l>
						<l>But I had known of him, and he</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Knew something of my faulty rhymes;</l>
						<l>So from the first it seemed that we</l>
						<l rend="ti-1"> Had met each other oftentimes.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I see him as I saw him then,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1"> His stalky frame of a goodly size,</l>
						<l>His breadth of shoulders, and again,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1"> Read truth and candor in his eyes.</l>
						<l>His broad, good-natured, beardless face</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">In those old days was full and round;</l>
						<l>No mark of care, and not a trace</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Of furrowed worry could be found.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>His soul was tuned to mirth and fun,</l>
						<l> A fertile mind for prank or joke,</l>
						<l>And through his words would often run</l>
						<l>A vein of humor when he spoke;</l>
						<l>And yet at times, when in repose,</l>
						<l>Across his features there would steal</l>
						<l>A nameless something, only those</l>
						<l>Who toil and struggle ever feel.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-129" n="131"/>

					<lg>
						<l>And though I came to know him well --</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">For with the years our friendship grew, --</l>
						<l>I never asked -- he did not tell --</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And so for years I never knew</l>

						<l rend="ti-1">Against what odds he waged the fight,</l>
						<l>Nor from what depths he dared begin</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">To struggle upward to the light.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I cannot tell the story here;</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">He would not have me dwell upon</l>

						<l rend="ti-1">Would count the picture overdrawn.</l>
						<l>Of those who meet him, day by day,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1"> But few the simple truth will know,</l>
						<l>Since in his unassuming way,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1"> It is his wish to have it so.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Life has its lessons, which we cannot read,</l>
						<l>What good can come of grief? Why hearts must bleed?</l>
						<l>Why the dull earth must hide from mortal view</l>
						<l>The sweetest and the best we ever knew?</l>
						<l>While yet "'tis morning and the day is long,"</l>
						<l>Why hushed forever is the blithest song?</l>
						<l>Why they, whose ways were tenderness and peace,</l>
						<l>'Mid fearful wreck should find such rude release?</l>
						<l>And why, oh why! -- Will no one make reply? -- </l>
						<l>Must these, the loving, far from loved ones die?</l>
						<l>Could not the shining gates Paradise</l>
						<l>For their sweet souls have opened otherwise?</l>
						<l>Was there no other way by which to prove</l>
						<l>Their courage, patience, fortitude and love?</l>
						<l>We know not, and all questioning is vain;</l>
						<l>The stoic's heartless creed will not sustain,</l>
						<l>Nor give surcease from sorrow Human Art</l>
						<l>Has found no balsam for a bleeding heart.</l>
						<l>And faith is all too weak; too frail our hope.</l>
						<l>We look beyond our sorrow, and we grope</l>
						<l>Blind with our grief, and vainly question, why?</l>
						<l>Nor do the years give answer, tho' we try,</l>
						<l>When time has dulled the barbed shafts of woe.</l>
						<l>Still we may question, but we may not know.</l>

						<pb id="VAA9489-131" n="133"/>

						<l>The why and wherefore, here we may not see</l>
						<l>But somewhere, somehow, in some time to be,</l>
						<l>In God's own way, perhaps beyond the skies,</l>
						<l>The discord of this life will harmonize.</l>
						<l>Yet grief is grief, and sorrow will not flee,</l>
						<l>But sits enthroned until eternity.</l>
						<l>And so, my friends whose sorrows I may share</l>
						<l>I know how hard the burden is to bear.</l>
						<l>Yet I can only come and take your hand,</l>
						<l>For I am speechless. But you understand,</l>
						<l>If wishes were but words how I would try</l>
						<l>To offer something that would satisfy,</l>
						<l>But I can only clasp your hands and go,</l>
						<l>And still I question, for I do not know.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>From branches, low bending, above me,</l>

						<l>And wish I could understand.</l>
						<l>What lesson, oh, Master Builder, to me,</l>
						<l>By this structure, would you teach?</l>
						<l>Is it a sign, a symbol, or a song,</l>
						<l>Or should it a sermon preach?</l>
						<l>Drip, drip, drip, in the gloom of endless night;</l>
						<l>And I, whose life is the life of a moth,</l>
						<l>Strive vainly to read aright!</l>

					<head rend="center">A PARTING THOUGHT.</head>

					<lg>
						<l>Songs have their season, in the early morn,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1"> Who cares to listen to a plaintiff lay?</l>
						<l>Sadness, through discord to the hopes new born,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Is often harmony at close of day.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>We have no voice for sorrow when we meet,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">For gladness fills the heart to overflow;</l>
						<l>But in the evening, songs however sweet</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Are hushed to sadness when our friends must go.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>But wait one moment, friends, before we part;</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">There still is something that I fain would say,</l>
						<l>One sentiment, outspoken from the heart,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">To carry with you as you go your way.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Our lives are measured not by years alone,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Nor by the plaudits which the partial give,</l>
						<l>Nor yet, by passing greatness carved in stone,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1"> All fail, 'tis only deeds of worth that live.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>And he who careless of the world's applause,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Moved by a motive, not a passing whim,</l>
						<l>Goes forth to battle for a worthy cause</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Is great, though fame may never come to him.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9489-140" n="142"/>

					<lg>
						<l>What matters it to me if self be lost,</l>
						<l>If that for which I stand shall still endure?</l>
						<l>If only fame be missed, then small the cost,</l>
						<l>A name forgotten, but a cause secure!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>And this the parting thought to take with you,</l>
						<l>What e'er your calling or where e'er you dwell,</l>
						<l>Our lives are measured by the good we do.</l>
						<l>Rewards are only incidents. Farewell.</l>
					</lg>
