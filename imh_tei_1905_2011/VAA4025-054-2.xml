                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s increase in land area and its advance towards a complex and diversified
                    economic establishment clearly placed it in the category of <hi rend="i">city.</hi> Its steady,
                    youthful growth during the thirty-year period preceding the Civil War is confirmed by the federal
                    census reports. The 1830 population of 2,079 had doubled by 1840, and with its 4,220 inhabitants the
                    Scribner settlement at the lower end of the <geogName>Ohio Falls</geogName> had become
                    Indiana's largest city. By 1850 the population had almost doubled again (8,181). <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> was still the largest city in the state, the ninth largest in the Old Northwest, and
                    among the first hundred in the nation. This relative prominence of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> was destined to pass as other points in the region accelerated their own pace toward
                    urbanization. The 1860 census, rather disheartening to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> boosters, revealed that the city's population of 12,647 was only a few hundred
                    more than that recorded for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and that it was almost six thousand short of that listed for the now booming capital, <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there was evidence on every hand that the mid-century community had outgrown the
                    status of town. The cultural and racial homogeneity of the earlier years was less conspicuous and
                    class lines, based chiefly on success in local economic ventures, were making their appearance. East
                    Main (Upper High) Street was rapidly becoming a select neighborhood, while less favored areas in the
                    lower section, particularly those subject to flooding by the river, were already developing slum
                    aspects. With the construction of business blocks and other brick edifices the downtown landscape
                    was undergoing a noticeable transformation, while the peripheral areas were being quickly filled in
                    with frame dwelling houses. By the early 1850's <placeName>

                    </placeName> possessed extensive centers for amusement and recreation, and it offered an impressive
                    array of churches and fraternal organizations. It had two daily newspapers, a lyceum, the beginnings
                    of a public library, and most of the other facilities for intellectual stimulation and leisure that
                    would be found in a contemporary <placeName>

                    difference between the 1839 arrangement and the earlier one was that the position of mayor was added
                    and functions normally ascribed to the executive branch of government were somewhat systematized. <placeName>

                    the basic structure of local government was retained; functions which had been worked out over the

                    each of the six were elected annually to serve as the legislative branch of the city government. The
                    mayor, elected every two years, served as city judge as well as chief executive. Among the other
                    officials prominent in the affairs of mid-century <placeName>

                    </placeName> were the city clerk, the treasurer, assessor, marshal, engineer, street commissioner,
                    and attorney. All were elected annually in compliance with state law. Positions allotted by
                    appointment included weigher, measurer, gauger, and the coveted ones of marketmaster and
                    wharf-master. The job of "chief fire engineer" was created in 1853, and the first
                    real city school board, a refinement of a complex earlier trustee system, was appointed this same
                        year.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> By the middle of the 1850's most of those services normally

            <p>The village designed by the Scribners in 1813 remained the core of the expanding community, with the
                    city's physical expansion following a pattern dictated by the presence of the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> and the neighboring knobs. State Street, which ran southeast to
                    the river, continued to be the chief thoroughfare. That portion of the city southwest of State,
                    appropriately referred to as the "lower," i.e. downriver, end of the city, was
                    built up for ten blocks—about as far as it could be on level terrain. Major expansion was
                    in the direction of the "upper," or eastern, end of the city, and before 1850 this
                    portion had been occupied for a distance of several blocks to Ninth Street.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                    Silver Street, about ten theoretical blocks farther east, is shown on maps of the period as the

                    claims as to their adequacy ignored a few pertinent facts. "Unlike some metropolitan cities

                    and turnpikes, the city's streets were laid out, macadamized, opened to traffic, and then,

            <p>These conditions did not prevail because of any lack of regulations applying to the streets. A
                    comprehensive list of laws was drawn up under the earlier town government and most of them were
                    retained in a modified form as city ordinances. In the 1830's local laws had been passed
                    prohibiting digging or taking away "any earth, sand, or gravel to the injury of any
                    street," or "placing any obstructions on any street, alley, side walk or public
                    ground." Gutters along the paved streets were supposed to be cleaned periodically, at least
                    once a month, and loose stones swept back into their proper place.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> In 1844 the
                    city was divided into "road districts" to facilitate street maintenance, with work
                    in each district directed by a supervisor who had authority to call upon any resident to join in the
                    maintenance labor.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Later (1853) when the position of street commissioner was
                    created this work was centralized under his supervision. The commissioner was authorized to
                    "employ the necessary workmen" and use the inmates of the city jail to help him

                            under such laws are rare. In 1830 a Luke Enlon was criticized for obstructing the sidewalk
                            with a pile of cord wood, but the town fathers decided just to remind Enlon that there was a
                            regulation to the effect that sidewalks were not supposed to be cluttered. Minutes of the

                            European laws providing for street and road maintenance. Section 3 states that "It
                            shall be the duty of each supervisor: elected … to notify each person resident in
                            his respective district liable by law to work on the roads, of the time and place [in] the
                            district at which such person is required to work for two days specified in said notice, and
                            the tool or instrument he is required to bring with him." Section 4 provides that
                            the supervisor has the authority to collect the "penalty" from
                            "… every person notified to work as aforesaid and not exempt by law or
                            excused by the Mayor and Council, who shall fail to comply with the provisions of this
                            ordinance." It is unlikely that residents, rich and poor, turned out in any great
                            number to perform work on the streets; thus, the practical result of this ordinance was the
                            levying of a "corvee" tax.</item>

            <p>As with other public facilities, maintenance of the public pumps was desultory. When a pump broke,
                    the people who depended on it were obliged to go for days without sufficient water or were forced to
                    carry their needed supply for several blocks from another neighborhood.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Public
                    wells and pumps were natural focal points for exchange of gossip, and this neighborly congregation
                    was sanctioned so long as it did not seriously interfere with the primary function of the watering
                    places. But an early town law prohibited bathing, washing of clothes, or the fastening of
                    "any horse, ox, or team to or at any such well or pump," and this regulation was
                    retained in substance in city ordinances of the early 1850's.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    street, alley, sidewalk, or public place" were ignored with a remarkable
                        frequency."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> For example, in 1854 when a pedestrian on Market
                    Street became the victim of a deluge of dishwater from a second-story window, he relied on a
                    personal form of law enforcement and heaved a brick "through the aperture from whence the

                    prevented from selling tainted food, that residents cleaned up their backyards, and that

                    reflected in the hospital controversy of 1852. The Presbyterian Theological Seminary in <placeName>

                    </placeName> was prepared to sell its buildings and site on East Elm to the city for a hospital.
                    There was no local hospital, and the editor of the <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi> was representative of
                    the faction who wanted the situation to remain just that way. To him a hospital was synonymous with
                    pest-house—"a receptacle for the victims of small pox, ship fever, and other
                    infectious diseases, who are landed from Southern steamboats." Such a place would be a
                    "manifest outrage on the rights of citizens owning property in the vicinity." He
                    pointed out further that the city was rapidly building up toward this section, and a populous
                    neighborhood was certainly no place for a hospital. If one were necessary at all it should be placed
                    a safe distance outside the city limits "on a high, open space, where fresh air, would be
                    constantly blowing, and away from the heart of the city, surrounded by the dwellings of citizens,
                    who, with their families, are momentarily in danger of being stricken down by the poisonous effluvia
                    constantly sent forth from the disease filled building."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> The proposal
                    to establish the hospital was ultimately defeated, and though during the Civil War residents of the
                    city became accustomed to having emergency hospitals for wounded soldiers in their midst, it was

                    Headed by a John Cook Bennett, it was granted a charter in 1833 by the Indiana General Assembly. It
                    was to have "full power and authority to confer or cause to be conferred degrees."
                    There is only one known extant diploma from the "College," but many more were
                    probably issued. The issue date of the one extant diploma was only forty days after the charter

                    medical school in Indiana, but later scholars have concluded that it was strictly a degree-selling

                    facilities for fire protection. In 1830 there was little organization and practically no equipment
                    to deal with the frequent conflagrations; by 1860 there were five well-trained fire companies with
                    some of the best fire-fighting apparatus obtainable. <placeName>

                    hand-operated pump for which the American Hydraulic Company was paid three hundred dollars. To
                    insure its efficient operation the council this same year authorized the formation of a
                    "volunteer" fire department known as the <placeName>

                    There was an ordinance making it mandatory for every able-bodied man to appear at a fire to lend his
                    assistance. Two fire wardens were appointed in each of the three wards (1836), and, according to the
                    ordinance, they "shall number themselves, by ballot, from one to six; and shall have
                    command in the order of the respective numbers, that one who shall have the lowest number, present
                    at any fire, being the first in command.'' The second-in-command, designated the

                    direction for that purpose to the citizens." The other four wardens, all with white bands
                    on their hats to designate their authority, served as deputies and aids to the commanding fire
                        warden.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> This rather involved chain of command was dispensed with in 1853

            <p>Water to subdue the flames came from special cisterns located at strategic spots throughout the

                    "Good leather fire-buckets" were supplied by the individual property owners: every
                    owner of a "dwelling house, store, or ware-house" had to supply one; for every
                    additional eight hundred dollar value of his property he had to make available an extra one. When
                    the alarm was given every citizen was supposed to run to the scene with his bucket, or, if for some
                    excusable reason he could not make it to the fire, he was to have the bucket accessible by placing
                    it in front of his house.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

                    the normal friction which is a concomitant of urban living.</p>
            <p>In the 1850's civic officials never found a way to cope with the outbreaks of robbery and
                    burglary. After dark thieves swept in from their rendezvous along the river or in the nearby hills,
                    broke into shops and houses, maliciously accosted pedestrians, and then were gone without a trace by
                        morning.<hi rend="sup">84</hi> The presence of a police force, consisting of a full-time marshal
                    and six or seven "watchmen," apparently added zest to the game played by the night
                        marauders.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> In 1853, when the store of a leading merchant was burglarized
                    under their very noses, the whole force of watchmen was temporarily dismissed as a waste of the
                    taxpayers' money.<hi rend="sup">86</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Assaults on night pedestrians were common. On one occasion James Brooks, retired president of the <placeName>

                    editor of the Ledger advised the carrying of revolvers by persons venturing out at night with money
                    in their pockets that they might "be able to answer rationally the demands of

                        $100 in money last night. It appears that the money was in his pocket loose, and upon

                    little wonder that law enforcement officers were distracted from more serious offenses. Drunken
                    rowdyism, wife-beating, and an occasional outbreak of serious rioting kept the watchmen busy most of

                    offenders as Dave Collins went on a drunken rampage there was excitement enough for everybody.
                    Collins and his Irish friends spent one thrill-packed evening in the summer of 1859 beating up two
                    German families in the west end, attacking random pedestrians on the downtown streets, and then
                    upsetting two men in a skiff along the river bank. "Thinking forbearance no longer a
                    virtue," west end residents formed a vigilance party and rounded up Collins. Next morning
                    the mayor fined him five dollars and costs.<hi rend="sup">116</hi> The Irish were just above the
                    Negroes on the social ladder, and for dozens of misdeeds whose responsibility could not be readily
                    established, the Irish served as convenient scapegoats. Some of the more reckless, such as Dave
                    Collins, accepted their role as troublemakers and played it to the hilt.</p>
            <p>Representatives of the German population were also conspicuous in many of the local brawls of the

                    sanctioned by their neighbors.<hi rend="sup">117</hi> On the whole the Germans of the community were
                    "accepted" and did not bear the same social stigma as the Irish. But occasionally
                    they were victims of violent outbursts of anti-foreignism, and they were not reluctant to defend

                        trouble, and therefore supported movements to restrict their number within the city (and within
                        the nation, i.e., emigration to Liberia). But he maintained in his editorialized news accounts
                        that the Negro must be treated in accordance with the established laws. On occasion he used
                        abusive language in referring to Negroes, but he stood firmly against any form of mob action.

            <p>The damage to railroads, steamboats, bridges, and public stores inflicted by the raid amounted to at

                    </placeName> was destined to disobey the orders of his commanding officer and cross the <placeName>

                    </placeName> raid. Then, even with the same tactical mistakes and the same' losses, he

                    </placeName>'s men were less war-weary, less starved for luxuries, and better

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> was probably exaggerated by the Republican canard that all Democrats were traitors of

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> might have welcomed the raiders more warmly if <placeName>

                    </placeName> had been able to keep them under control.</p>
            <p>Of more significance was the opportunity which lay within the grasp of General Braxton Bragg in 1862
                    and which was never to come again. That summer Bragg invaded <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. If he had joined forces with General Kirby Smith while <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName> harassed the Federals' rear on Northern soil, he could easily have taken the
                    entire state out of the Union. All that was needed was to prevent General Don Carlos
                    Buell's being reinforced at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName> could have accomplished that, just as he prevented Burnside from reaching Rosecrans in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> a year later. But Bragg said no, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName> obeyed him. Buell got back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, consolidated his forces, and returned to the offensive; and the Confederates'
                    opportunity was lost.</p>
            <p>All this is based on the assumption that Braxton Bragg would have acted swiftly and vigorously in
                    conjunction with a raid by <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName> in 1862, and that of course is a large assumption. Still it can be soundly argued that

                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName>'s disobedience lies in its postponement. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName>'s original proposal was a good one, but when finally his patience with his

                    statistical, Rosecrans's strategic, but neither's decisive. Bragg's force
                    was smaller than Rosecrans's, but it was in top condition, had the advantage of shorter
                    supply lines, and was maneuvering on familiar terrain. If Burnside could be kept in the North, the

                    to be resorted to if the crossing at Buffington Island failed. As for the dissidence in the North,
                    he would naturally have welcomed a large-scale revolt, but there is no good evidence that he counted
                    on support from Copperheads, in spite of attempts to prove that he was deeply involved in
                    "the Northwest Conspiracy." For one thing, <placeName>

                    </placeName> the year before must have taught him not to expect recruits from Southern sympathizers.
                    If his fellow Kentuckians would not rally round him, certainly few disaffected Hoosiers and Ohioans
                    would do so. Morever, his treatment of the few Copperheads who approached him in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> demonstrates his lack of confidence in the Knights of the Golden Circle.</p>
            <p>"Good," he is reported to have said to one of them, as he took the

                    a party of home guards were established on the Indiana side behind houses and haystacks. The
                    raiders' Parrotts had to be put into action to silence the single Hoosier field-piece
                    before the crossing could commence. Then, after the Second <placeName>

                    the bend and began tossing shells alternately at the raiders on the Indiana shore and those who had

            <p>The appearance of the gunboat brought the ferrying to an abrupt halt. Worse still, it put the entire
                    Confederate force in a hazardous position. Delay was dangerous, because pursuing Federal cavalry
                    would soon be coming up from the south. Yet if the crossing was abandoned, half the troops would be

                    out, foraged and scouted for several miles on both sides of the main force, and then rejoined it in

            <p>Although Confederates and their sympathizers made various raids across the <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName> into southern Indiana during the Civil War, the one led by General John Hunt Morgan
                    exceeded them all in size. Morever, it caused more excitement, resulted in more property damage, and
                    created more legends than did any of the other raids. The objectives and results of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName>'s raid continue to be interpreted with much diversity of opinion; for
                    instance, see the article by Professor William E. Wilson in this issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana

            <p>General Morgan's cavalry division included approximately 2,400 troops when it arrived at the
                    little <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> town of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Brandenburg</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, on the
                    morning of July 7, 1863. During the previous day advance scouts had captured two steamers, the
                    "J. T. McCombs" and the "Alice Dean," for use in crossing the
                    river. Meanwhile, the Indiana Legion (Home Guards) and local volunteers called for reinforcements
                    and girded for conflict.</p>
            <p>On July 8 <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName> easily crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> despite the opposition of the Indiana Legion and local volunteers. Proceeding northward
                    against sporadic opposition from the Hoosiers, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName>'s cavalry spent the night several miles south of Corydon and about ten miles
                    from the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Next morning, July 9, the Indiana Legion and the local volunteers fought the invaders at the Battle
                    of Corydon, a mile or so south of the former state capital. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName>'s cavalry were soon victorious and immediately marched into Corydon and looted
                    the town, then headed toward Palmyra and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>

            <p>The account of the Battle of Corydon which follows was written by Simeon K. Wolfe, editor of the
                    Corydon <hi rend="i">Weekly Democrat</hi>, and a participant in the battle. Though his estimate of
                    4,500 men with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName> is about twice the actual number, Editor Wolfe frankly admitted quick defeat for the

            <p>Our town and community have been the scene of intense excitement during the whole of the past week in
                    consequence of the invasion of the State at this point by the notorious guerrillas under the equally
                    notorious John Morgan. A vast amount of damage by horse-stealing and other plundering has been done
                    which it is impossible for us to detail at the present time with any great degree of accuracy, but
                    we think it a safe estimate to put the loss to our citizens at the least at $100,000.</p>

            <p>On Tuesday evening (July the 7th) the steamboat T. J. McCombs landed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brandenburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was immediately captured by <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName>'s advance guard then in possession of the town. The McCombs was taken by the
                    rebels to the middle of the river and there she hoisted the sign of distress. Soon after the Alice
                    Dean coming up was hailed to give relief. For that purpose she approached the McCombs and was thus
                    also captured by the rebels. The news of the capture of these boats was communicated by some Union
                    men of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brandenburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Lieut Col: Wm. J. Irvin, of the Indiana Legion, then at Mauckport. A short time
                    after receiving this intelligence the Lady Pike coming up was hailed by Col. Irvin at Mauckport, and
                    turned back to Leavenworth for a six-pound gun und [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] assistance; a dispatch
                    was also sent to Col. Jordan at Corydon for reinforcements to intercept the rebels crossing. At
                    midnight the Lady Pike returned with the Leavenworth gun and a small company to man it under command
                    of Capt Lyons and Col. Woodbury. Before daylight, on Wednesday morning the gun was in position on
                    the bank opposite <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brandenburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and as soon as daylight and the disappearance of the fog would render it practicable
                    the gun was directed by Col. Irvin to be fired upon the boilers of the vessels with a view of
                    sinking or disabling them and thus prevent the crossing of the raiders. This command, we are
                    informed by Colonel Irvin, was countermanded by Provost <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marshall</region>
                    </placeName> [sic] John Timber-lake who claimed precedence in command on the occasion, and an order
                    was given by the latter officer, to shell the rebel cavalry on the bank. Another and different
                    version, however, of this matter, we understand is given by Provost Timber-lake; but we have not
                    been able to see him and obtain it. This shelling was done for a short time with some success,
                    causing the rascals to skedaddle to the rear of the town in fine style but before getting out of the
                    way some thirty of them were killed and wounded. Soon, however, after our gun opened fire, two rebel
                    batteries, one at the Court House at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brandenburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the other towards the lower part of <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-054-2-046"/> town,
                    began to play with terrific force upon our gun with shells, making it too hot for our boys to hold
                    their position. They abandoned the gun, but afterwards retook it and carried it farther to the rear.
                    The rebel infantry from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> shore also kept up a brisk fire across at our forces; and our infantry, consisting of
                    Capts. Farquar's Huffman's and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hays</settlement>
                    </placeName>' companies of the Legion, in all not exceeding 100 men, returned the fire
                    briskly.</p>
            <p>But the superior artillery force of the enemy soon compelled our small force to abandon the gun
                    again, and then under the cover of his batteries, the enemy began to cross their thieving forces to
                    the Indiana side. Our boys held the ground as long as it was prudent or safe in the face of the
                    forces coming against them, and then retired.</p>
            <p>In this gallant little fight we lost two men killed and three or four wounded.—The killed
                    were, Georia Nance of Laconia and James Currant of Heth township. Capt Farquar was pretty badly
                    injured by his horse running him against a tree. The names of our wounded in this fight we have been
                    unable to obtain.</p>

            <p>Failing in the effort to prevent the rebels crossing Col. Irvin and provost Timberlake ordered the
                    men to fall back on the road to Corydon and by skirmishing and falling trees to obstruct the passage
                    of the enemy as much as possible until reinforcements with artillery could be had from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to which place dispatches were repeatedly sent for help; but for some reason, which we
                    hope the authorities of that post will be able to explain, <hi rend="i">we never got a man or a
                    gun!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not deterred however by this neglect, or the overpowering forces in our front, the people went to
                    work and by great exertions a force of Home Guards and citizens, number about 300 effective men,
                    were got together on Wednesday evening and marched out on the Mauckport road to skirmish with the
                    enemy and impede his progress as much as possible. The main body of these under command of Col.
                    Jordan, went as far as Glenn's house four miles south of Corydon. Here the infantry
                    remained until about 10 o'clock at night and returned to the neighborhood of Corydon, while
                    the cavalry and mounted citizens to the number of over one hundred men were sent on the roads
                    running south of Corydon as scouts to watch the operations of the enemy. Several small engagements
                    between the skirmishers occurred on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning; in one of these one
                    rebel was <pb n="135" id="VAA4025-054-2-047"/> killed near Glenn's house, and two prisoners
                    were captured. The rebels, shortly afterwards at the same place shot John Glenn, a son of Peter,
                    through both thighs, and about the same time—shot and killed Peter Glenn, an old and well
                    known citizen, and burnt his dwelling and barn. In their progress to Corydon they also burn Peter
                    Lopp's Mills on Buck creek, which is all the burning of property we have heard of them
                    doing in the county. Their principal depredations being in horse stealing and robbing houses and
                    citizens of everything valuable.</p>
            <p>Many "hair-breadth escapes" and gallant charges are reported by these skirmishers,
                    but we have not the space for detailing them at this time.</p>

            <p>About 11½ o'clock on Thursday morning our scouts brought the report that the
                    enemy was approaching in strong force up the Mauckport road toward Corydon. Our forces, consisting
                    of about 450 Home Guards and citizens under command of Col. Lewis Jordan of the Legion, assisted by
                    Provost Timberlake (late Col. of the 81st Indiana regiment) and Maj. Jacob Pfrimmer (who up to this
                    time had been engaged with the cavalry in scouting) formed a line of battle on the hill one mile
                    south of town, the extreme right wing resting at the Amsterdam road and the left near the Laconia
                    road, making the Mauckport road, along which the main body of the enemy would approach, about one
                    third of the distance of the entire length of the line from the right wing. The ground on the left
                    of the Mauckport road is a heavy woods and though not hilly is somewhat uneven, which with the logs
                    and underbrush made it difficult for a cavalry charge. This portion of the line was well selected
                    for the purpose of saving our men from the rebel fire, but bad for the purpose of enabling our men
                    to operate effectively against them, the line being at least fifty yards too far north, being that
                    distance from an elevation in the ground which prevented either party from seeing the other before
                    the enemy arrived to that distance from our line. Temporary breastworks composed of logs and fence
                    rails were hastily thrown up by our forces which did good service in impeding the charge of the
                    enemy.</p>
            <p>About an hour later, the enemy made his appearance in small force, probably one company, about three
                    quarters of a mile a little to the left and in front of our line where they were handsomely whipped
                    by the infantry under the command of Captain G. W. Lahue which had been placed there for <pb n="136" id="VAA4025-054-2-048"/> picket duty. In that fight we lost one man killed, named Steepleton,
                    and had none wounded. The rebels had several killed and six or seven wounded. Before this skirmish
                    was fairly over, the enemy made their appearance in front of our main line along the Mauckport road
                    in strong force. We (the editor) were with a squad of the Henry Rifles under command of Maj.
                    McGrain, at the extreme right of the line on the Amsterdam road and had a full view of the
                    approaching enemy. They completely filled the road for nearly one mile. As soon as they approached
                    in range the Henry Rifles opened fire and did good work, the enemy being in full view. Soon the fire
                    became general along the entire right wing, which checked the advancing column of the enemy, and
                    compelled them to undertake to flank both our wings at the same time, a performance which the great
                    disparity of forces enabled them easily to do.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the flank movement was began [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] and before it was executed, the
                    enemy opened upon our forces with three pieces of artillery, making the shells sing the ugly kind of
                    music over our heads. This shelling operation, together with the known fact that our line would be
                    strongly flanked on both wings at the same time made it necessary for the safety of our men, for
                    them to fall back. This was done, not with the best of order it is true, for our forces were mostly
                    undrilled, but with excellent speed. From this time the fight was converted into a series of
                    skirmishes in which each man seemed to fight upon his own hook mostly after the manner of
                    bushwhackers.</p>
            <p>In the meantime the enemy had completely flanked the town, having, before a gun was fired, taken
                    possession of the plank road one mile east of town, where our men in their retreat were intercepted.
                    Upon the right wing a large flanking force was sent against our lines and the fighting was very
                    sharp for the space of 20 minutes in that quarter; twelve Henry Rifles and a squad of 30 or 40, some
                    100 yards to their left, armed with the ordinary rifle musket holding a heavy body of flankers in
                    check for ten or fifteen minutes and compelling them to dismount.</p>
            <p>Being completely overpowered by numbers our forces gradually fell back to Corydon and the cavalry and
                    mounted infantry generally made their escape. After the field was taken by the enemy they moved
                    forward, and planted a battery on the hill south of the tom, and threw two shells into the town,
                    both of them striking near the center of main <pb n="137" id="VAA4025-054-2-049"/> street, one
                    exploded but did no damage. Seeing the contest was hopeless and that a continuance of the fight
                    would only result in unnecessary loss of life and the destruction of the town, Col. Jordan wisely
                    hoisted the white flag and surrendered.</p>
            <p>The enemy immediately marched in and took military possession of the town; and then the work of
                    pillage soon began. Everything the rebels wanted in the eating and wearing line and horses and
                    buggies they took. The two stores of Douglass, Denbo &amp; Co., and S. J. Wright and the two
                    Steam Mills were the heaviest losers. The two stores were robbed of about $300 each and a
                    contribution of $700 each in cash was levied upon the two mills in town and a like sum
                    upon Mauck'smill near town. This large sum Messrs. Leffler &amp; Applegate, Wright
                    &amp; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and John J. Mauck were compelled to pay to save their Mills from the flames. Many other
                    citizens lost in horses and other property from 100 to $600, Mr. Hisey was robbed of
                    $690 in cash. But we have not space enough to enumerate the pecuniary losses few or none
                    escaped entirely.</p>
            <p rend="center">LOSSES.</p>
            <p>The Union losses, beside property, are as follows:</p>

            <p>Our loss in prisoners was about 300 all of whom were paroled.</p>

            <p>Under all the circumstances we think our boys did exceedingly well. It was not expected at the start

                        <p>I was just studying the other day whose time it was to write mine or yours and could
                                    not come to any satisfactory conclusion, when your letter arrived and as a matter of
                                    course I was the debtor and I have since found out I owe you two letters instead of
                                    one. I received yours with the miniature three weeks ago, but never could manage to
                                    sit down and write. We have had rather exciting times in Indiana for the last few
                                    weeks, and have had a few of the miseries of the south pictured to us though in a
                                    small degree. On the doubly memorable ninth of July a visit was paid to the citizens
                                    of Corydon and vicinity by <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                                    </placeName> and his herd of horse thieves. We heard Tuesday night that they had
                                    crossed the river and had disgraced the soil of Indiana with their most unhallowed
                                        <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-054-2-052"/> feet. Our home guards skirmished with the
                                    rebs from the river to [Corydon] and on one of the hills overlooking the town had a
                                    grand battle. The <hi rend="i">battle</hi> raged violently for thirty minutes, just
                                    think of it! and on account of the large number of the rebs we were forced to retire
                                    which our men did in good earnest every one seemed determined to get out of town
                                    first but which succeeded remains undecided to this day. After the general
                                    skedaddle, Col Jordan wisely put up the white flag—and we were prisoners
                                    to a horde of thieves and murderers. I don't want you to think I am making
                                    fun of our brave home guards for I am not in the least. But now, that all the danger
                                    is over, it is real funny to think how our men did run. Gen. Carrington awarded
                                    great praise to us and we all think that is something. What could 350 undrilled home
                                    guards and citizens do against 4,000 well drilled and disciplined soldiers (?) We
                                    did not even know Hobson was following him. We sent to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                                    </placeName> time and again for help and not one man or gun did they send us. Though
                                    we have found out since that it was the fault of Gen. Boyle and not the people of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. It made <placeName>

                                    </placeName> so mad to think a few home guards dared to fight his men. I am glad
                                    they done it just to spite him. However they captured most of the guards and
                                    parolled them and killed three of our men. Father was out fighting with his Henry
                                    rifle but they did not get him or his gun. One of Morgans spies was in town three or
                                    four weeks visiting his relatives and some of his men helped our men to build the
                                    entrenchments. I guess none of the rebels down south are that accommodating are
                                    they? One of our brave boys run three miles from the rebels, and really run himself
                                    to death. He stopped at a house and fainted and never came to. Dident he deserve a
                                    promotion? I think that was the awfullest day I ever passed in my life. The rebels
                                    reported around that they shot father because he would not surrender, but it was all
                                    a story. The rebs were pretty hard on the copperheads but they did not take a thing
                                    from us. The[y] kidnapped our little negro and kept him three weeks but he got away
                                    from them and is now at home safe. We killed six or eight of theirs and wounded
                                    twenty five or thirty. I expect you are tired of hearing about <placeName>

                                    have not got time to write much more or I will be too late for the stage so Goodby.</p>

            <p>Stephen Keyes Fletcher (May 30, 1840-July 6, 1897) was one of Calvin and Sarah (Hill)
                    Fletcher's eleven children. Calvin Fletcher was one of the earliest settlers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his family was one of the most prominent and influential in the capital city.</p>
            <p>Stephen Keyes Fletcher enlisted in the Thirty-third Regiment, Indiana Volunteer Infantry on October
                    14, 1861, and he was immediately detailed as Ordnance Sergeant. In July of 1863 he was discharged to
                    accept a commission as First Lieutenant and Adjutant in the One Hundred Fifteenth Indiana Infantry
                    Regiment, and he joined that organization on August 14, 1863. He was mustered out on February 24,
                    1864. Although the journal was not begun until March of 1862, it narrates events from the
                    author's enlistment in October, 1861, until October, 1862.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>The Civil War journal of Sergeant Stephen Keyes Fletcher reveals in vivid prose the hopes and
                    disappointments, the pleasures and hardships, the difficult monotonous work, and the long delays and
                    dry-runs of a soldier's life. A keen observer of both the physical characteristics of the
                    area in which he served and of the life and attitudes of his fellow soldiers, Fletcher records his
                    impressions in clear and at times dramatic style. During the period of the journal, the major
                    military operations of Fletcher's regiment were directed toward the capture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cumberland Gap</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Union forces occupied the Gap after its evacuation by the Confederate forces only
                    to find themselves, in turn, blockaded, and as Fletcher wrote: "For 9 months we marched
                    &amp; countermarched through rain &amp; snow mud &amp; water just to take the Gap,
                    &amp; just 3 months ago … we took it. … We have lived on short rations
                    every [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] since. … But for four weeks now we have been blockaded
                    … &amp; now just three months after we leave it as we took it, with a hungry gut
                    &amp; a lean belly" (see pp. 182-183).</p>
            <p>Following the Civil War, Stephen Keyes Fletcher became a well-known and highly respected business man
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In addition to his business activities he operated a model dairy farm about fifteen
                    miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His first wife was Miss Mary Malott, who died in 1876, and his second wife was Miss
                    Laura Maxwell. John H. B. Nowland, who knew him well, described him as "rather below medium
                    height," with "light hair and complexion," and as "genial and
                    pleasant in manner."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                        <p>It was my desire to join the armie immediately on the first call. But circumstances
                                    did not permit of my doing so until the middle of October (1861) Ingram<hi rend="sup">4</hi> &amp; myself worked together on the farm through the
                                    summer, both desirous of going to war as soon as the summer work was done. But when
                                    in the middle of August we learned of Drs. being taken prisoner,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> the war fever raged high in my breast. But about this time I had my right
                                    shoulder fractured by jumping a horse over a pair of bars. It was nearly two months
                                    before I could use it at all. When my shoulder got about well I told Ingram I had
                                    determined to go to war. He said that he was going, &amp; that I must stay
                                    &amp; take charge of the farm, as one of us had to stay. So we threw up a cent
                                    to determine which should go. I got it 5 times out of 7. I began to get up a company

                                    other man. He was a tall, slim, ugly, plain man, a perfect bundle of nerves. I got
                                    what I wanted here, &amp; started back the next morning with a wagon &amp;
                                    40 boxes of <hi rend="i">pills</hi> When I arrived at camp late in the evening I
                                    heard that marching orders had come for us to push on to Wild Cat 22 miles farther
                                    down. That Gerred<hi rend="sup">10</hi> at that place was expecting an attack from
                                        Zollicoffers<hi rend="sup">11</hi> whole force. All was excitement about moving.
                                    The details although they might be interesting, would take up time &amp; room
                                    that would hardly pay, as so many things have happened of the same kind since we
                                    have been out. The Regt started about 11 o clock A. M Saturday, 19th &amp; after
                                    a hard drive over some of the worst roads, hills &amp; rocks that I ever saw, we
                                    arrived at Mt Vernon just at dark, 10 miles from Camp. My wagon of ammunition
                                    stalled, stuck several times during the day, so that we had to doubleteam teams,
                                    &amp; a good deal of swareing &amp; hollooing was done to pull out. At Mt
                                    Vernon I divided the load into two wagons, so that we went through without more

                                    &amp; myself with several others slept on the parlor floor in the hotel. About 3
                                    oclock in the morning, Col. Coburn came in, &amp; told us he had just received a

                                    on them." All was astir now, &amp; &amp; the Regt was ready to
                                    start at sun up, &amp; most splendidly did he show forth that beautiful sabbath
                                    morning as our boys wound around the foot of the large hill near this town. Their
                                    bayonets all sparkling in the sun. It was a stirring sight to me at least. We
                                    trudged on over the hills &amp; through the mud at a forced march. About noon I
                                    came up to <geogName>Rock Castle river</geogName>. Here was quite an exciting scene.
                                    The Regt. had most all crossed, a boat load had just started across as I arrived on
                                    the bank. The large elm trees with their wide spreading branches made almost a
                                    perfect arch over the river. Col Coburn stood at the landing on his horse, cheering
                                    the boys on. The crossing of the boys &amp; the anticipation of a fight 3 miles

                                    pushed on anxious for the fray. From the river to Wild Cat, 3 miles, we met wagon
                                    load after wagon load of sick soldiers from Gerrards Regt. They all reported the
                                    pickets fighting ahead. The home guard Cavelry passed us going full tilt. Every one

                                    Regt was formed &amp; all ready for the word. 4 of our companies were sent over
                                    west to build breast works &amp; guard a pass where we expected the enemy to try
                                    to flank us. The other 4 companies (there being two left at Crab Orchard) went East
                                    on the hill where the fight took place. I went with this party. Went up double

                                    this was completed we were fired upon. A scattering fire now took place which lasted
                                    about an hour &amp; a half. About 10 minutes after the firing commenced one of

                                    through the pine trees just at the edge of the camp. The last one struck about 6
                                    feet below our canon in the bank. As soon as they found out that we had canon, they

                                    were camped on a ridge just below a high hill, which we built strong breast works
                                    all round. Johny Wilkins &amp; myself went &amp; got the Courthouse for a

                                    commence winter quarters &amp; I had gone out 6 miles to a mill to engage lumber
                                    for bunks, roofs &amp;C. I engaged 12,000 feet of pine lumber, but before I got
                                    back to camp, orders had come for us to march back to Crab Orchard immediately. All
                                    was now excitement. Not a Regt had enough wagons to move everything immediately, so
                                    they had to <hi rend="i">press</hi> teams in of the farmers. Col started me out as

                                    any other. Our Regt got started about 10 P.M. The moon was shining bright The boys
                                    were all in fine spirits. But were mad to think they could not go to the gap.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                        <p>Durham &amp; I started Saturday evening on horseback. I had an old clay bank that
                                    would not work to the wagons, an old saddle tree with no stirrups or girth. With my
                                    blanket over it. I had been riding this for 3 days &amp; nights &amp; was
                                    getting pretty tired. Holliday and Lt. Johnson<hi rend="sup">25</hi> started on foot

                                    our sick &amp; wounded boys were. Here I took sick by sleeping in a feather bed.
                                    This night the ground froze for the first time. The trees were white with frost next
                                    morning. We took an early start &amp; found our Regt about dark, camped in the
                                    woods about 1½ miles east of Crab Orchard. Found they had been without

                                    raid threw them into a relapse, &amp; they took the typhoid fever, a great many
                                    were left on the road &amp; some died before they ever got up with the Regt.</p>
                        <p>Our Regt was reported unfit for duty &amp; took up quarters in camp at the
                                    springs in Crab Orchard. The men took sick fast. Between the 1st &amp; 10th of
                                    Dec. we had about 600 men in the Hospital, or in every house in the town. For two
                                    weeks they died from two to 5 a day. About 55 died while we were here, nearly two

                                    matted on the ground, making it splendid for camping until the rains set in. With

                                    about 3 oclock we camped about a mile from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Found the roads thus far very good. The <placeName>

                                    In the evening they practised shooting at a big apple tree that was full of blossoms
                                    on a hill about a mile &amp; a quarter [s]traight over the town, which is in a
                                    valey. The shells whistled over &amp; nearly scared the people out of their <hi rend="i">boots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thursday morning we took an early start &amp; passed down throug[h] Mt Vernon,
                                    &amp; wound around up the hill, opposite, just as we did on just such a morning,
                                    6 months before lacking 3 days.</p>
                        <p>Here we took the <hi rend="i">ridge road</hi>, right on the tops of the hills (or
                                    young mountains) Most of the time we had to go in single file, &amp; I could
                                    look a head, for ½ a mile &amp; see the Regt winding a long <hi rend="i">up, up</hi> the hills over the peaks &amp; along the rocky cliffs.
                                    The boys supposed that some one had directed the Col this way for a <hi rend="i">nearer cut.</hi> They ripped &amp; swore, &amp; said they would give
                                    anything to know the man that directed the Col this road, they would shoot him with
                                    out mercy.</p>
                        <p>When we got to the river &amp; found the wagons had not yet got up, &amp;
                                    that we had saved a <hi rend="i">great deal</hi> by coming the way we did, that the
                                    main road was a foot or two in mud, they all cooled down. We crossed the river
                                    &amp; camped just where we had formed to give out ammunition just before the
                                    battle at Wild Cat. Here we learned that our wagon that we had hired to haul our
                                    knapsacks had broken down &amp; would not be up. Lieut Whitson started back to
                                    get another wagon &amp; bring them through, if he could. Our boys with several
                                    other companies in the same fix had to sleep without blankets. This <list type="footnotes">

                                    The 14th Ky. &amp; artilery camped opposite on the other side of the river.</p>
                        <p>Friday morning we moved on up towards Wild Cat. The train &amp; artilery had got
                                    in before us. Found the roads very bad, &amp; every wagon making them worse. We
                                    were stopped continualy, on account of some wagon that was stuck or some canon that
                                    had got too heavy for its 6 horses. A great many little things happened while we
                                    were on the march, &amp; especialy while we were at a rest, on the road, that I
                                    thought I would remember, that would be realy interesting. Here at this place while
                                    the boys were setting along on each side of the road waiting for a wagon to get out
                                    of a mud hole some of the boys got after a lizzard, there were about a dozen after
                                    it, &amp; persued it until they had killed it with as much interest &amp;
                                    excitement as though they were after a rebble. Then they got to <hi rend="i">snapping</hi> stones across at each other, calling them shells. They would put
                                    a little stone on the hammer of their gun, point &amp; snap it. It would through
                                    the stone pretty straight. As we came up to our old camp at Wild Cat, instead of
                                    hearing the roar of canon, the thunder was pouring forth roaring voleys, &amp;
                                    the rain commenced pouring down in torrents. We ran into the old house used last
                                    fall as our magazine. But we had been here but a few moments when the Cap.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> came up &amp; yelled out "<hi rend="i">roll out
                                        Co E.</hi>" So we pitched out, &amp; were soaking wet in a very
                                    short time. But what is a <hi rend="i">soldier fit</hi> for, if he cant stand rain.
                                        <geogName>Hoosier hill</geogName> looked perfectly natural, the breast works
                                    were still standing. Nearly 6 months ago I had bid farewell to this place hoping
                                    never to see it again. But it seems to be the <hi rend="i">doom</hi> of the 33rd to

                        </p>
                        <p>We camped on Zollie's<hi rend="sup">39</hi> last camp ground, on the bank of
                                    little rock castle. We had come but 5 miles, but were very tired from marching
                                    through the mud &amp; raine. We cut hemlock branches for beds. Our wagon had not
                                    got up yet, &amp; we slept under the fly of our tent, rather thin as the night
                                    was very chilly. The Lieut<hi rend="sup">40</hi> came up said he had got another

                                    river, except 16, which were 5 miles back from the river, making 10 miles from camp.
                                    I said, as the fellow did on the cars when the old man asked him if he knew he was
                                    on the road to <hi rend="i">hell.</hi> He said just my <hi rend="i">darned
                                    luck</hi>, always on the wrong train. I said it was just my luck to have my knapsack
                                    left back 10 miles, &amp; so I found it. 36 of us started back. We found the
                                    road for 3 miles lined with the train of wagons, stuck in the mud, mules into their
                                    bellies, teamsters yelling &amp; hallooing. All except 18 staid with our wagon
                                    to help it on to camp. I cut off one of my blankets &amp; sold it for 50 cts,
                                    rather cheap but the best I could do. We made the trip of 20 miles in just 8 hours.
                                    Found the Regt gone ahead, but our Co. We pushed through next morning, &amp;
                                    found the Regt at <hi rend="i">Camp Conel</hi> laid over to rest until we got up. It
                                    rained all day.</p>

                                    While we were out we saw two fellows skinning a hog. We went up to them and they <hi rend="i">skedaddled.</hi> They just took the hams &amp; left all the rest.

                                    received a letter from Lucy &amp; one from Laura.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> It
                                    really made my load lighter to get two letters. 2 miles from <placeName>

                                    </placeName> we crossed <geogName>Little Laurel river</geogName> which was very
                                    high, covering the road for ½ a mile. Some of the boys stripped off to go
                                    through, But I rooled down my pants &amp; <hi rend="i">bolted</hi> right ahead.
                                    After I got across I went to cross a little neck of water about 5 feet wide. Two
                                    rails lay across it with the ends under the water, &amp; I thought rested on the
                                    ground. But as soon as I threw my wait on the rails, I went nearly to my waist. The
                                    boys yelled &amp; had a good laugh over it. It was real amusing to see them

                        <p>The country from <geogName>Rock Castle river</geogName> to Barboursville is the
                                    poorest I ever saw. Nothing but rocks &amp; hills. No level land at all. The
                                    steep side hills were all that was cultivated &amp; very few of these. There is
                                    very little preparation for crops, &amp; it looks as though they will starve in
                                    another winter. They plough altogether with one horse or mule with a plough
                                    something like <hi rend="i">what</hi> we call a <hi rend="i">bull</hi> tongue. As we
                                    struck the <geogName>Cumberland river</geogName> we came into a beautiful, little
                                    valey. It was about a mile wide. Here were some nice fields. The grass looked nice
                                    &amp; green. The mountains on each side were all green, &amp; the <hi rend="i">dog woods</hi> in full blossom were scattered thickly over their sides,
                                    making a beautiful contrast. Barboursville is quite a pretty little place situated
                                    in this valey. I suppose about 1000 inhabitance. After we passed through
                                    Barboursville about 3 or 4 miles, Lieut Whitson &amp; myself stopped at a house
                                    &amp; got our dinner We thought it was our only chance &amp; last chance to
                                    eat in a house, so we went in strong. Had butter milk cornbread, pork &amp;
                                    greens. The woman that waited on the table would ask us if we would have some <hi rend="i">pork &amp; salid.</hi> We had a good laugh about her calling <hi rend="i">turnip greens, salid.</hi> About 2½ miles from town we found
                                    young Foley. In the evening I went back from camp to see him. A pretty sharp young
                                    man, Sergt. in <hi rend="i">Mondays Cavelry.</hi> When I returned it was pitch dark
                                    &amp; raining. On coming down a steep place I slipped &amp; fell, striking
                                    my right <hi rend="i">jaw</hi> on the end of a rail, sticking out from the fence. I
                                    saw <hi rend="i">Stars</hi> by the thousand. I thought it was broke, &amp; the
                                    first thing I done was to work it to see that none of the machinery was out of
                                    order. This was Thursday the 24th.</p>

                                    miles from camp, &amp; next to the outmost pickets. The house where we were
                                    stationed, had once been a very respectable one The farm looked as though it had <hi rend="i">had</hi> an owner a little above the <hi rend="i">generality</hi> of
                                    people around here. During the day a man of about 30 &amp; lady of 25 I should
                                    think came up, the lady picking some stray flowers that had sprung up through the
                                    hard trodden ground. I asked them where they were going, &amp; as the man took
                                    out his pass he said, here is where I used to live. But its all gone now. I said
                                    something about his property being destroyed, he sighed &amp; said I once had a

                                    a tear came in his eye, &amp; he turned a way. I realy pitied them. The Rebbles
                                    had torn every thing to pieces.</p>

                        <p>Here we still lay in this valey surrounded by mountains, the sun coming down hot
                                    enough by day to scorch the hide off of us, &amp; at night so cold that 3

                                    4th). Sunday it rained nearly all day. I was setting in the tent writing to Ingram

                                    yet come up. There are some men in every Regt that can always see the first straw,
                                    dry leaves, broomsey, &amp; any thing good to make them a bed of, &amp;
                                    always lookout for their own comfort. As soon as we stopped, some struck out into
                                    this field, cutting the stalks to sleep on as the ground was low &amp; full of
                                    water. It seemed like a hungry drove of cattle turned into a bluegrass pasture. 2 or

                                    whole field of 8 or 10 acres was covered with busy workers gathering corn stalks. I
                                    was among them of course. in 15 minutes not a stalk 2 feet high was left. Tired
                                    &amp; wet, I went to bed at dusk also the other boys. We had been in bed about

                                    was formed. Loaded our guns to order &amp; all we wanted was the word. Just then
                                    the Maj came riding down the street yelled out, <hi rend="i">drummers beat the long
                                        roll.</hi> Then came that <hi rend="i">long, stirring</hi> monotonous sound. The
                                    Regt. hussled out in a hurry. There was pulling &amp; hauling for guns, some had
                                    lost their cartridge boxes. Some a bayonet, some couldnt find their hats, but all
                                    got out finaly. We were formed across the cornfield, several other Regts were formed
                                    across. Fosters<hi rend="sup">47</hi> battery was moved up in front so as to rake
                                    the road right along river. Here we stood for about 2 hours every moment expecting
                                    the Rebbles would come on to us. But it was a <hi rend="i">water haul</hi>, nary

                                    than the word came for us to go out on picket. All went willingly, for they were

                                    ½ frame ½ stone right on the bank of the river, or just room
                                    between it &amp; the river for the road. The Mount, running up abruptly from
                                    behind. Here 12 men were called for to go 3/4 of a mile to another house. I couldnt

                                    volunteered. When we got to the house which stands 3 or 4 hundred yards from the
                                    road, I was tired &amp; wet &amp; lay'd on a big stone about 20
                                    feet in front. I had been there but a <hi rend="i">second</hi> when I heard
                                    something up the hill back of the house, sounded like a man walking. I jumped up
                                    instantly &amp; started that way. Just then I heard Corporel Montgomery yell
                                    out, <hi rend="i">halt, halt</hi>, there, walk right up here or I <hi rend="i">blow</hi> the daylights out of you. &amp; I saw through the thick darkness the
                                    shadow of a man, or form of a man &amp; I thought the <hi rend="i">bigest</hi>
                                    man I ever saw. He was a soldier with gun &amp; accoutrements. <hi rend="i">Who
                                        are you</hi> &amp; what are you doing here, was immediately asked. He was
                                    undoubtedly very much scared, said well Im here, youve got me. As he approached you
                                    could hear the <hi rend="i">click</hi> of more. than a dozzen guns. Where are the

                                    there &amp; had been peeping round &amp; just then I saw the form of a man
                                        <hi rend="i">skedadling</hi> up into the bushes about 50 yards up the hill, I
                                    put after him yelling <hi rend="i">halt, halt.</hi> But he disapeared, I did not
                                    shoot, I dont know why. I was <hi rend="i">cool</hi> &amp; had my gun ready. I
                                    suppose because I wasnt shure of my game But as I found out afterwards, it was a
                                    good thing I did not. For they turned out to be our own pickets, of the 22nd KY.
                                    that had been stationed at the Moss house &amp; when our pickets were fired on
                                    in the evening, &amp; our Cavelry run in, they got scared &amp; put to the

                                    every moment, so we kept out eyes &amp; ears open. It was a cloudy, foggy night

                                    little thought or care on my mind, as that old cow. That I might lay down even on
                                    the ground &amp; sleep without fearing the cry to <hi rend="i">arm they
                                    come</hi>, I thought. But there was no other sound. Not even the <hi rend="i">bay</hi> of the long, lean lank, yellow eared mountain hound. Nor the shrill <hi rend="i">crow</hi> of a neighboring <hi rend="i">dung hill</hi> to tell us the
                                    hour of the night. All seemed, uninhabited, uncivilized. No! all was not silent,
                                    either, as gray dawn appeared, the doleful sound of, <hi rend="i">whip poor

                                    for a pillow, I was soon asleep. It was broad daylight when I was wakened by one of
                                    the boys who yelled out, <hi rend="i">Fletcher</hi>, come wer going, you 11 drown
                                    laying here. The rain was pouring down right into my face. Instead of going back to
                                    camp where we could get our breakfast, the rest of the Co came out &amp; we
                                    marched on out the road they said to meet the <hi rend="i">Rebbles</hi> &amp;
                                    give them a round. Went about a mile &amp; half, placed ourselves behind two
                                    little noles, where we could rake them as they came down the road. Here we were
                                    until 12 M. the raine pouring down in torrents. We were wet to the hide, tired from
                                    having no sleep, &amp; nothing to eat since the night before. The boys would go
                                    to sleep just setting round. I saw 7 all sitting on the rocks, with their heads hung
                                    down, fast asleep. This was <hi rend="i">soldiering.</hi> Where is all that romance
                                    in camp life that you read about in so many novels. Where every man wares a feather
                                    in his hat &amp; a sword &amp; pistol by his side. All is success &amp;
                                    pleasure. Venison was their meat, &amp; wine was their drink, &amp; a <hi rend="i">good steed</hi> carried them. But <hi rend="i">where, where</hi> is the
                                    romance, the pleasure, of war. You can put it all in your eye. An eleven &amp; a
                                    half pound musket, on our shoulder, &amp; 30 to 40 round of oz balls, in our
                                    cartridge box. And all our earthly property on our backs. Fat bacon &amp;
                                    crackers to suffice our appetite and strong coffee without sugar or milk to wash it
                                    down. Once in a while we are furnished with flour &amp; the boys make what we
                                    call flap jacks, Beat up into a thick batter &amp; fry in grease. They are heavy
                                    &amp; not fit for a dog to eat, &amp; men begin to get sick after living on
                                    them a few days. Sometimes, beans &amp; rice &amp; sugar. This is soldiering
                                    at Cumberland Ford, in the Great Rebellion of 1861. &amp; 2.</p>

                                    this? If there is I cant find it. But I came to war because I felt it my duty. I was

                                    this May 12th 1862 and there seems to be a fine prospect for staying here two weeks
                                    longer. Gen Morgan<hi rend="sup">50</hi> has issued an order to drill 6 hours a day.
                                    Pretty hard on <hi rend="i">fat bacon &amp; flap jacks.</hi> We are called by

                                    making 3 hours in the fore noon, from ½ past 3 until 5 P.M. this is
                                    battalion drill, dress parade at $42 past 5, then Battalion drill till 7.
                                    The aim is to get the drill in the cool parts of the day. The days are very warm
                                    here, &amp; the nights very cold. We sleep with 3 blankets &amp; a quilt

                                    postage stamps. I hear from home often. I have been up on a mountain just across the

                                    see or distinguish men or canon. They have 14 or 16 anon, 2 of which are heavy guns.

                                    have to die sooner or later. We know not the hour nor the day when death will visit
                                    us. May we be prepared that whenever it does come, we may meet those that have gone

                        <p rend="center">Sunday afternoon June 1st 1862.</p>
                        <p>On the night of the 22nd May we were ordered to be ready to march next morning at 9.
                                    In the morning all were busy, throughout the camp, prepareing rations, scouring guns
                                    &amp; C &amp; C. We did not get started until about 11. We had marched but a
                                    hundred yards from camp, getting into a sunny open place when Gen Morgan met Col
                                    Henderson, &amp; asked him where he was going. Says he you have no orders to
                                    move at this time 11 oclock you were ordered to march at 9. So you can halt your
                                    Battalion here until you get orders to move. So here we lay in the sun for nearly 2
                                    hours, when we recd orders to march.</p>
                        <p>The boys cheared &amp; yelled when we started. I got my nose thougheraly sunburnt
                                    for about the 6th or 8th time this spring. We took the right hand road at the Moss
                                    house. But proceeded but a short distance<hi rend="sup">57</hi> when we overtook the
                                    19th Ky. wagons. Here we lay for an hour waiting for them to get out of the way. But
                                    when they did we went but about 200 or 300 yards until we overtook them again. Here
                                    we rested most of the afternoon The boys talked &amp; laughed &amp; cut up
                                    as usual on a march. I noticed that the beach trees all around were newly pealed. I
                                    couldnt tell what it ment. But soon saw the boys taking of the bark with their
                                    bayonets, &amp; eating the iner portion. Of course I tried it, it had a sort of
                                        <hi rend="i">sweet bitter</hi> taste. But I realy had no particular relish for
                                    it. Just before dark we went up a steep winding hill. On one side was quite a <hi rend="i">jump</hi> off, not exactly a precipice. We went but about 200 yards
                                    beyond this when we again overtook the wagons in front of us. Our teamsters soon
                                    came up, &amp; said that Co E's wagon had <hi rend="i">capsized</hi> on
                                    the hill back. One fellow said it had turned over 2 or 3 times &amp; was 20 feet
                                    below the road &amp; could not be got up without taking to pieces. Some one must
                                    go back &amp; help it up. But all were tired &amp; hated to move, so I <list type="footnotes">

                                    along. 2 or 3 followed. We found the wagon had just jumped over the bank &amp;
                                    run down in the gullie, &amp; that nothing was hurt, but with a little hard work
                                    could be got out. The guards that were left with the wagon were sitting lazily
                                    looking at the wagon. The boys cursed them <hi rend="i">for all that was out</hi>
                                    for not chocking the wagon as they should. Soon the whole Co came back. We could not
                                    do much that night, so we built fires around, got out our rations &amp; took a
                                    quiet supper I was glad we got to sleep here, we were away from the noise &amp;
                                    bustle of the Regt. We tumbled on the ground &amp; slept finely, although there
                                    was a very accomodating rock that stuck up just high enough to dig me in the ribs,
                                    &amp; not allow me to sleep to soundly. For all that one thing happened that
                                    night that makes me <hi rend="i">remember</hi> it more forcibly. I had a <hi rend="i">long pleasant dream.</hi> A dream that had a commencement &amp; and
                                    end. It had realy a pleasant tendency away here in these wild woods. I hope I will
                                    remember it.</p>
                        <p>At day break we were up had our wagon out &amp; ready to start. Found the Regt
                                    just where we left it mostly ready to start. Took our places &amp; waited for
                                    the order to march. Here the boys lay along the side of the road &amp; up under
                                    the trees on the side of the Mt waiting for the word. But no word came, getting
                                    tired they would take off their knapsacks &amp; take it easy.</p>
                        <p>I saw Col C. during the fore noon &amp; asked him what caused the delay. He said
                                    he had orders from Gen Morgan not to move until further orders. The telegraph line
                                    was put up as fast as we went. About noon <placeName>

                                    </placeName> &amp; staff came out &amp; we were moved ahead about
                                    ½ a mile &amp; pitched tents in a little valey of about 10 acres,
                                    right down in the <hi rend="i">Mts.</hi> We had been here about an hour, were
                                    getting dinner ready, &amp; the boys building booths all round to lay under as
                                    the sun was <hi rend="i">very</hi> hot, when Col. C. came round &amp; ordered us
                                    to <hi rend="i">strike</hi> tents. Told us we were going back &amp; expected to
                                    go up the Gap road. In two hours we were back at the <hi rend="i">Moss house</hi>,
                                    &amp; when the head of the column filed right towards the Gap there went up a
                                        <hi rend="i">prolonged yell</hi> that made the hills <hi rend="i">ring
                                    again.</hi> But <hi rend="i">loo</hi> this exciting pleasure that we had so long
                                    waited for, &amp; seemed now so near was soon knocked in the head. The Regt was
                                    halted &amp; marched back towards the <hi rend="i">ford</hi> &amp; camped
                                    where we now are, on the side of the Mt about half mile from <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-054-2-079"/> the Moss house, just where the Rebles camped last
                                    winter. Our tent sets just where one of theirs did. They had it all leveled off <hi rend="i">nicely</hi> for us &amp; some of our roofs are fastened to their
                                    old pegs. This is called <hi rend="i">Camp Whip Poor Will.</hi> Very appropriate
                                    name too, for every evening at dusk the whip poor wills commence their to sing out
                                    their <hi rend="i">dolefull</hi> penalty on <hi rend="i">poor Will</hi> &amp;
                                    long before morning it is again commenced. At night I can stand in my tent &amp;
                                    look up at the valey &amp; across up the Gap road, &amp; it looks like a
                                    vast city, hundreds of tents, &amp; nearly all lighted, &amp;
                                    there's a hum of voices, singing &amp; blowing of bugles &amp;
                                    beating of drums &amp; rumble of wagons like the noise of a great <hi rend="i">metropolis.</hi> What means all this noise. What is all this queer business
                                    that has called so many thousands on thousands forth to live in this way. As I lay
                                    down on my blanket at night these thoughts are pondered over &amp; over in my
                                    mind. All have come out with one intention, for one great purpose. How long it will
                                    last, we cant tell. We are all anxious for it to close that we may return to our
                                    homes. But are determined to <hi rend="i">see</hi> it closed <hi rend="i">honerably</hi>, or die in the effort.</p>

                        <p>Almost continual marching for the last three weeks has kept me from writing up my
                                    journal, &amp; I have seen so much in that time of interest that I am afraid I
                                    will never get it all wrote up.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday, the 7th of June we were ordered to prepare with 4 days rations &amp;
                                    be ready to march at ½ past 4 next morning. According to order we were on
                                    hands &amp; started, we knew not where, but knew that it would be <hi rend="i">some place</hi>, &amp; no failure this time. The 8th, 9th &amp; 10th
                                    marched straight ahead, making about 11 miles a day. Took the same road we did
                                    before. The 11th we laid over where we camped the night of the 10th 2 miles from
                                    Rodgers Gap, 68 Cumberland Mt. During the day the artilery cavelry &amp; all
                                    teams got up, &amp; some of the artilery went on up the Mt. 2 brass guns came up
                                    pulled by bulls, 3 yoke to each. The driver was setting on the canon driving with
                                    lines to the leaders. This created quite an excitement &amp; those two pieces
                                    has since gone by the name of the bull battery. At dusk we <list type="footnotes">

                                    foot of the Mt the moon was just appearing over the top. She was just full &amp;
                                    looked so beautiful. It was a deliteful night &amp; made the hard march more
                                    pleasant. The assent from that side of the Mt is very steep. But the expectation of
                                    a fight on the other side made us forget all fatigue. So we soon made the top. Here
                                    we found a good road right along the top of the Mt. about 3 miles long running East.
                                    The moon shone right in our face. The large oaks &amp; walnut &amp; chestnut
                                    trees stood on each side of the road just far enough apart to form beautiful groves.
                                    Here was good level or rolling land enough to make a good farm. Very little was said
                                    through the whole line, nothing could be heard but the <hi rend="i">tramp tramp</hi>
                                    of the men. Orderly Walingford<hi rend="sup">59</hi> struck up Lillie Dale,
                                    &amp; 3 of us came in &amp; it realy sounded beautiful, besides it seemed
                                    appropriate. Then Walingford raked up his memory &amp; come out a little on the
                                    theatrical, which enlivened the crowd considerable. We rounded the point marched
                                    down through the Gap which is high precipitious rocks on each side leaving but a
                                    narrow space to pass through. Here the road is very steep &amp; makes a turn of
                                    a right angle. We came then in to a wide shallow gulley or small valey away ahead we
                                    could see the line of the edge of the Mt. The white misty line stretched clear along
                                    the Mt. here we found the siege battery standing at the side of the road looking
                                    like great black monsters on wheels asleep. As we marched up the slope &amp;
                                    turned the point at the top to the right where the road commences the decent, the
                                    view was most grand. I never saw any thing of it before &amp; never shall again.
                                    To the right the Mt ran away above us, to our left it went straight down down
                                    hundreds of feet. Away to the front &amp; left of us, we could look as far as
                                    the eye could pierce into a <hi rend="i">vast nothing.</hi> Away below us we could
                                    see the tops of the Mts ridges. The fog had settled down so that nothing could be
                                    seen but the tops. They looked perfectly straight, &amp; even &amp; smooth.
                                    At first I thought they were cultivated ridges. I looked up at the moon, but lo the
                                    upper edge was becoming darkened. I continued to look, did my eyes betray me, or was
                                    it so. Ah! I remembered then, it was the 11th of June. This night the moon was to be
                                        <hi rend="i">eclipsed</hi> full according to the almanac. The scene was now <hi rend="i">grand</hi> yes, it seemed strange. <list type="footnotes">

                                    &amp; going right in the opposite direction. I was thinking of home, wondering
                                    if they were looking at the eclipse. We saw two wagons that had run over the side
                                    lay up side down against the trees away below. The last one we passed we could just
                                    see the image of a man sitting in the bed. Cap spoke to him said you had a pretty
                                    serious accident, an[y] one hurt. "No," said the fellow but one of
                                    your men just struck me with a stone on the side of the head, while I was laying
                                    here asleep, &amp; the blood's running down my face. Some fellow I
                                    suppose had very foolishly pitched a stone into the wagon, not knowing there was
                                    anyone in it. The moon was fast getting dark &amp; by the time we got to the
                                    foot, only streaks shone through between the trees &amp; dark shadows were cast
                                    across the road before us by the big rocks or trees. The eclipse had just closed
                                    over the moon &amp; nothing could be seen but a dim firey ball as we were halted
                                    &amp; tumbled down by the side of the road to sleep on our arms. We had just
                                    rolled in our blankets when the pickets commenced firing all around below us. We
                                    were all on foot in a minute. But there was no more disturbance &amp; in 10
                                    minutes we were all down &amp; passing off to the land of nod. We were up at
                                    early day light to see what there was to be seen. We found we were just at the foot
                                    of the Mt. just below us was a big mill over <hi rend="i">shot</hi>, run by a big
                                    spring, the finest I ever saw. It run three mills, a cording mill, grist &amp;
                                    saw mill. Just beyond this was a big two storied white frame house, with a nice yard
                                    &amp; fence &amp; shrubery. Beyond to the right &amp; left as far as the
                                    eye could see stretched Powels valey.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> This was a pleasing time
                                    to the eye. For the first time in two months, we could look without some big Mt or
                                    some big object coming in our view.</p>
                        <p>About 9 oclock we started up the valey with two Regts 33 Ind. &amp; 19 Ky. 2
                                    guns, &amp; some Cavelry on a forageing expedition. The valey looked beautiful
                                    every thing was in the heighth of prosperity. Fields of golden wheat just ready for
                                    the reapers, corn looked very flourishing, &amp; some grass was cut. Most of the
                                    people professed to be Union. But I have little faith in their loyalty. We got back
                                    to our camp about 3 PM. Now we thought we would have time to take a good <list type="footnotes">

                                    that in two hours we had to start back over the Mt. This made the boys sware. They
                                    did <hi rend="i">cuss</hi> like good fellows. They didnt give us time to get supper.
                                    But started us in about ½ an hour after getting into camp. Just about sun
                                    set we had reached the top of the Mt. Now the view that seemed so strange to us the
                                    night before presented itself in a different light altogether. The view was most
                                    delightful. Away hundreds of feet below is [us?] lay the valey, about 3 or 4 miles
                                    wide &amp; stretching to the right &amp; left along the Mt as far as you
                                    could see. Square fields dotted with corn, luxurient fields of wheat, a grove here
                                    &amp; there &amp; the farm houses scattered about, made the scene, most
                                    picturesque picturesque. It was very hot, &amp; the loads we had to carry made
                                    us very tired, &amp; the boys declared it an imposition to have to carry a <hi rend="i">magazine</hi> on their backs, &amp; the 40 rounds of cartridges in
                                    our knapsacks were flung out at very halt. We passed one 30 lbr Parrott gun going up
                                    a very steep place, which about? 4 way up made a very sharp right angle. It had 26
                                    horses to it. But as fast as they turned this angle they lost all power, so they had
                                    to be taken off &amp; it pulled up by a block &amp; tick. When I saw how
                                    hard these cannoneers had to lift &amp; push &amp; what trouble they had, I
                                    was glad I was not one of them but was an Infantry soldier, &amp; had nothing
                                    but my own little self to <hi rend="i">spur</hi> up the hill. Some of the men became
                                    perfectly fatigued &amp; tumbled down by the side of the road pitching their
                                    guns away declaring they would go no farther. But would rather die there on the Mt
                                    or be taken prisoners But after a nights rest they all came on &amp; in a day or
                                    two all got with the Regt again We reached our old camp &amp; resting place just
                                    before dark. Here we remained over night making an early start next morning,
                                    &amp; about 4 P.M. were within ½ a mile of our next old camping place
                                    just across the line into Ky. It made the people open their eyes to see us going
                                    back they didnt know what it meant. Supposed we had got whipped or scared out. We
                                    understood we were to go to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. But when we got to this place we met the Cavelry going back towards
                                    the Mt &amp; said we would have to start back next morning. Now the boys <hi rend="i">cussed</hi> again. But going back over the Mt into Tenn suited them
                                    better than going to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. This night we had the best ground to sleep on we had had for some
                                    time. Charley Test &amp; myself made our bed down at the root of an old tree.
                                        <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-054-2-083"/> We were just getting to sleep when Charley
                                    jumped up, also Mtgomery &amp; Spratal who were sleeping near us, &amp; all
                                    yelled out, there's a rattle snake, there's a rattle snake. I laid
                                    still &amp; laughed at them which made Charley mad. He &amp; Sprat declared
                                    they would not sleep there, Mountgomery &amp; I told them they could go where
                                    they pleased, that we were going to sleep there. By this time about a dozen had come
                                    around with candles, but <hi rend="i">nary ratler</hi> could be found. Charley
                                    agreed to sleep there if I would change sides with him. As he was on the side next
                                    the old log where he heard the <hi rend="i">snake</hi>. I did this &amp; nothing
                                    more happened. One oclock next day found us back to our old camp &amp; resting
                                    place 2 miles from the Mt. We had made a forced march of it, although it was very
                                    hot. For no particular reason though, we were mad &amp; didnt care whether we
                                    marched fast or slow.</p>
                        <p>Here we rested about three hours &amp; again started up the Mt. We made the top
                                    &amp; the pretiest level place just before darke, near the big spring which runs
                                    off in quite a little brook. Here we tumbled down for the night. I was waked next
                                    morning by the birds, hundred of these feathered songsters were sending forth their
                                    notes of joy this beautiful Sabbath morning, the 15th of June. A mocking bird
                                    perched just above my head was mimicing all the birds imaginable. I was in hopes we
                                    would remain here part of the day &amp; have a real sermon on the Mt. But Sunday
                                    in war is the same as any other day. We made an early start &amp; were soon down
                                    the Mt. where we found Decorsies<hi rend="sup">62</hi> Brigade camped, also part of
                                    the artilery that had got over. We camped right at the foot in the woods. It was one
                                    of the pretiest camps I ever saw, the pretiest place to camp. Our wagons were back
                                    &amp; not likely to get over until the next day. Our rations were getting prety
                                    short, nothing but crackers &amp; very few of them. The boys scoured the country
                                    around for 2 or 3 miles, bringing in cornbread chickens meat &amp; every thing
                                    else that could be eaten. They all had money &amp; something to eat they would
                                    have at any price. On Monday the 16th 3 of our Companies went out forageing. After
                                    we had got out about 5 miles they concluded they would not need them &amp;

                                    the privilege of taking 6 men &amp; go across the valey &amp; bring in some
                                    forage <hi rend="i">for our own consumpsion.</hi> We struck out with the intention
                                    of having something to eat or some fun one or the other. 4 went one way &amp; 3
                                    of us another. After crossing the valey about 2 miles we entered a cedar thicket,
                                    then passed into an open square of about 10 acres surrounded by a growth of thick
                                        <hi rend="i">cedars.</hi> It seemed to have been an old field long since
                                    neglected. Through it ran an old road that had not been used for years as the dirt
                                    was all washed out &amp; the large naked stones remained. We followed this,
                                    &amp; passing through the hedge of cedars on the other side, saw away ahead of
                                    us an old two storied house, almost ready to tumble through, but still with some
                                    signs of habitation. This was about ½ a mile ahead of us across a little
                                    valey with a creek runing through it, all grown up on each side with willows
                                    &amp; scicamores, presenting rather a wild appearance. On its bank stood an old
                                    mill, its wheel broken &amp; weatherboarding partly torn off. Around stood half
                                    a dozen old houses, with roofs caved in, doors &amp; windows knocked out. The
                                    weeds had grown up thick around &amp; fences were all laid waste. About a
                                    hundred yards from the creek as we passed towards it stood a large old forge built
                                    of hewn stone &amp; about 30 feet high. It was all perfect, every stone in its
                                    place. On top of it were cedars 8 or 10 feet high. All around were old heavy
                                    castings, &amp; acres were covered with dross &amp; cinders. About in
                                    different places stood stone chimneys all covered with ivy. I saw it had been once a
                                    little town, but long since deserted. I thought of Goldsmith's deserted

                                    was nearly filled up. We found no one at the house but an old woman. She was sick. I
                                    asked the old lady about this old vilage. She said it was called <hi rend="i">Speed
                                        well</hi>, &amp; had been deserted about 50 years. Its day of <hi rend="i">speed</hi> had long since <hi rend="i">played out.</hi> She said it was a very
                                    prosperous place in its day. We went back to camp with our haversacks well filled
                                    with cornbread. But the fation of making bread down here is just with water
                                    &amp; meal, no salt nor lard.</p>
                        <p>On the next evening the 17th we were ordered to be ready to move at any time during
                                    the night We had about a cracker a piece. With this in our haversacks we laid down
                                    on the ground to rest until called for. I forgot to mention, on the evening before
                                    just at dusk word came up the valey that the Rebles were advancing &amp; that
                                    our teams that had gone out forageing had been cut off. In 30 minutes we were in
                                    line &amp; out ½ a mile from camp ready to go at it. We only wanted
                                    them to come. We had done some hard marching to find a fight and now we were anxious
                                    to have it. Here we remained about half an hour when word came that the news was all
                                    false. Some fellow had got scared &amp; magnifyed it to a big truth. Now for our
                                    march! At 2 A M Wednesday we fell in &amp; started towards the Gap. There were
                                    two particular objects in this move. We were to bag a party of about 2000 Rebles out
                                    about 8 miles &amp; then march on to the Gap. Two roads started out from the
                                    camp runing up the valey 3 or 4 miles apart, so;<hi rend="sup">64</hi> One Brigade
                                    went the right hand road cuming into the main Gap road on the cross road just beyond
                                    the the Reble camp. The rest of the division came on the main road, intending engage
                                    them the others came up on the other side &amp; bag the whole thing. But just as
                                    we were going to put the salt on the birds <hi rend="i">tail</hi>, the way she went.
                                    They had just left that morning, their fires were still burning. Here we rested
                                    &amp; the boys scoured the grounds tired as they were. Picking up Secesh papers
                                    &amp; C &amp; C. Not finding them here we pushed on to the Gap, which place
                                    we came in sight of about 4 P.M. The white tents were shining in the sun, &amp;
                                    had all the appearance of a lively camp. But we had heard from every person along
                                    the road that it had been evacuated that <list type="footnotes">

                                    &amp; lightning &amp; the big black clouds came rolling over the Mt. Soon
                                    the rain began to pour down, &amp; for two hours nearly, it soaked us to the
                                    hide. When it stopped raining we were within 3 miles of the Gap. The sun came out
                                    &amp; the most beautiful rain bow appeared that I ever saw. It appeared so close
                                    &amp; so perfect. The end didnt seem to be more than a hundred yards off. We now
                                    went for 2 miles through a thick woods where we couldnt see the works at the gap at
                                    all. We were tired &amp; worn out, we had had but one cracker the whole day. But
                                    we all at once came right out in full view of the Gap, &amp; all its works. The
                                    boys sent up one cheer that made the woods ring. It cheered them up &amp; they
                                    moved on with a quick spirited step. We now began to get into the clearing where
                                    they had cut the timber out &amp; all the hills to the right were surrounded
                                    with heavy rifle pits. A lively appearance was presented as we arrived in the little
                                    valey just at the Gap. Two brigades &amp; two batteries had arrived before us,
                                    being in advance. Decorsies Brigade &amp; Fosters battery had on arriving gone
                                    up into the Gap &amp; were firing a saloot. Because they were in advance
                                    &amp; arrived first, they claimed the taking of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cumberland Gap</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Straight before us on the far side of the valey were the Reble winter
                                    quarters neat log huts built in rows. Well roofed with good chimneys &amp; doors
                                    &amp; windows. The boys began ransacking them immediately, Getting good
                                    bedsteads, tables, chairs, stools, &amp; C &amp; C. The Rebles had left all
                                    their tents, but had slit them from top to bottom. They had left them all standing,
                                    so as to deceive us I suppose.</p>
                        <p>Worn out from the 20 miles march I could not visit the works that night, so tumbled
                                    down on the ground, &amp; slept soundly, although it rained. As soon as we got
                                    our breakfast Lt Whitson &amp; my self started to make the trip A perfect swarm
                                    of soldiers had been going up &amp; coming down all morning. We met some with
                                    good ovens &amp; lids, others with flour some with lard, crackers &amp; C
                                    &amp; C. We went around their works with our eyes open. Here was one part of
                                    Military art that we had never seen before. I cant describe it on paper. Here all
                                    the art &amp; science of military art had been displayed. Every point that
                                    guarded a hundred yards of space was fortifyed by rifle pits, breast works,
                                    &amp; C. They had left 5 canons, all 60 lbrs I believe. two of them had rolled
                                    over the abrupt <hi rend="i">bluff</hi>, but have since been pulled up &amp; all
                                    are now <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-054-2-087"/> unspiked &amp; ready for use. Any
                                    number of shot &amp; shell, grape &amp; canister lay about. Some of the
                                    shell were loaded. Some man carried one home with him down by the ford, his children
                                    were playing with it &amp; it exploded, shattering the mans leg. He died about a
                                    week or two after from it. They had left nothing in their magazines at all. They had
                                    destroyed a great deal of lard &amp; bacon, &amp; flour by emptying it into
                                    a big well. Out of this the boys took a great quantity. Here at the Gap is a big
                                    Grist mill run by water from a big spring cuming right out of the side of the Mt
                                    Also a big forge &amp; foundry, 3 or 4 houses &amp; a store. One big two
                                    storied white frame house. There is another thing of particular interest here that
                                    has tended to divert our minds from the dull, weary monotiny of camp life. That is a
                                    large cave in the side of the Mt about 150 feet above the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Va.</region>

                                    our Regt &amp; by a great many in other Regts, &amp; a great many fine
                                    specimens have been taken out. Lt Col Henderson sent home as fine a collection as I
                                    ever saw. I have also sent home a small collection. I was in it several times, also
                                    in several other caves on top of the Mt A real interesting description might be
                                    given of this cave by a good writer, but as I dont profess to be such I shall not
                                    attempt it. I have been in the Mammoth cave Ky. and several smaller ones, but never
                                    have I found one so beautiful as this, nor half so fine. High guttered, fluted
                                    columns, the color of rich honey comb Colums of stelagmites most magnifficent, and
                                    beautiful. One column about 30 or 40 feet high &amp; about 12 or 15 feet in
                                    diameter at the base we called "the <hi rend="i">tower</hi> of <hi rend="i">Bable.</hi>" The ceiling glittered with thousands of pure white
                                    steactights [stalactites] each with a drop of water on its point. One room was full
                                    of pure white knotty formations, another, chamber adjoining it, full of pure white
                                    smooth formations. One big chamber covered about an acre &amp; a half of space.
                                    We could not throw across it, nor throw nor see to the top. The rocks seemed to have
                                    tumbled in from the top from some great concussion earthquake or something forming a
                                    perfect conglomerated mass of big rough ugly rocks. In this chamber I got lost. I
                                    had very foolishly gone in by my self &amp; if some of the boys hadnt have come
                                    in after me, I probubly would have staid there by my self. but I have writen a

                        <p>Summer has almost gone by and my journal has been laying quietly in my knapsack. A
                                    great many things have happened throughout the general Government, through out the
                                    army, &amp; right here in our own division. But here its the same old tune,
                                    every soldier knows it. I dont care what part of the army he is in.</p>
                        <p>About the 1st of July we moved out on the Tazewell<hi rend="sup">66</hi> road
                                    &amp; camped near a fine large spring. It was the best camp we have ever had.
                                    4th of July passed off like a Sunday, there was nothing to do, &amp; the boys,
                                    mostly went out in the country, &amp; to the Gap &amp; other camps
                                    &amp;c. So the camp was left perfectly still, &amp; I was very glad of it
                                    too for I was not well &amp; prefered to keep still. We went on a 3 days
                                    forageing expedition into V.A. Also on one out to Tazewell. The last expedition
                                    there under Col Decorcey had quite a little fight with the rebles. I believe 3 were
                                    all we lost on our side. I was sick about 2 or 3 weeks, part of the time quite
                                    badly, in fack for 4 or 6 weeks after I was lost in the cave I was not well. I got
                                    perfectly chilled through. About the 1st of Aug false alarms got to be all the <hi rend="i">go.</hi> We were called out nearly every night. One night we thought
                                    they were coming sure. We were ordered to strike our tents &amp; take them off
                                    &amp; hide them. This was about 2 or 3 oclock in the morning. The sick were all

                                        <hi rend="i">nary</hi> came. So a little after day light we were ordered to
                                    pitch tents again. This is the way soldiering goes, hard enough, any man knows.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th or 9th I believe it was about 2 oclock in the morning we were <hi rend="i">yelled</hi> out &amp; ordered to strike tents &amp; prepare to move.
                                    This didnt suit us for we hated to leave our camp, as a man hates to leave a good
                                    home. In fact a good camp <hi rend="i">is home.</hi>

                        <p>We had but 2 wagons, all the rest had gone after forage. So it took longer to move.
                                    But we finally got our things all off &amp; then moved ourselves, to the gap

                                    minutes every tent laid low. We took position right up back of our camp on a steep

                                    and send a despatch over to the Rebles in the shape of a shell. <hi rend="i">Whiz</hi> they would go, singing through the air. The Rebles were firing also, but
                                    at Mondays camp. They did no harm! We were ordered to take 80 rounds of cartridges
                                    in our haversacks making 120 in all, a regular magazine. In about an hour we came
                                    back to camp &amp; in 3 minutes every tent was up again, &amp; we laid down
                                    on our beds &amp; took it easy, the canon all the time barking away. When the

                        <p>The Col had picked out a most beautiful camp ground right in the woods, wagons were

                                    was the only thing that made this a bad camp. Next day our cooking utensils came out
                                    but not our tents. So we laid around until afternoon, waiting either for our tents
                                    or the Rebles when we received orders to march back to the Gap &amp; Decorceys

                                    it was dreadful hard to get water. Such a task as I never want again. But it was not
                                    our luck to remain in one camp long, so in about a week we were moved down below
                                    just above the battery in the gap. &amp; here we are yet. Just inside of the
                                    long rifle pit running up from the gap. It is the dustiest dirtyest camp we have
                                    ever had. Wood &amp; water are both hard to get. We have been out on two or 3
                                    forageing expeditions since we have been blockaded with the expectation of a fight
                                    each time, but <hi rend="i">nary fight</hi> do we find. That is we dont go quite far

                                    range for they know that we can cut them all to pieces with artilery &amp;
                                    infantry. Last Sunday the 31st of Aug we started out early <list type="footnotes">

                                    but when we got to the bottom of the hill we were halted &amp; about faced
                                    &amp; marched back to quarters. The Gen had just got word that the Secesh had

                                    inspection, but before we were through with this were ordered out again. As we
                                    marched down the hill the canons on the hill commenced firing away at a rapid rate,
                                    we thought there was something up sure, &amp; the boys yelled out with joy. The
                                    roads are awful dusty, we have had no rain for 3 weeks. We marched down the valey
                                    road about 1½ miles, &amp; deployed in ambush. 2 or 3 canons had gone
                                    up on a point of a hill &amp; those &amp; the canons on the Mts threw their
                                    shell thick &amp; fast. But I believe they availed but little. We were only out
                                    2 or 3 hours But when we got back to camp, I was never more fatigued from a days
                                    march. Times are awful dull here. All the talk is about half rations &amp;
                                    surrendering. Next Sunday will be 3 weeks since we have been blockaded &amp;
                                    have been on half rations. We have done finely until now. This morning we drew our
                                    last flour, a <hi rend="i">pound a piece.</hi> This is the last. When this is gone,
                                    beans, rice, &amp; mixed vegetable soup will have to form our feed. Also
                                    ½ rations of bacon. It is pretty slim, but not near as hard as those at
                                    home would think. All I am afraid of is that those at home will <hi rend="i">fret</hi> &amp; think that we are starving. It is all the talk, But no one is
                                    scared yet, or but few. 3 or 4 are in our tent now discussing the probability of
                                    surrendering &amp; being parolled or retreating &amp; leaving every thing.
                                    We can stand it until about a week from next Sunday. We can hold the place as long
                                    as we have got <hi rend="i">feed.</hi> Hundreds of reports go the rounds every day.

                                    is geting most awful short. We have had no bread for a week &amp; over except

                                    But corn is very scarce, we have to go from 4 to 8 miles to get any. We have gone 5

                        <p>Last night the 4th Tenn Regt. <hi rend="i">Col Johnson</hi> were drawing new guns at
                                    the Commissary, and kept up a continual yelling &amp; noise so that I could
                                    hardly sleep. This morning as soon as it was light I looked across to the Commissary
                                    to see what was going on &amp; saw the large square hole dug in the side of the
                                    Mt for a magazine was filled half full of guns. I knew the thing was all up now. I
                                    knew we would never remain in the Gap 10 days nor three. Men were beginning to move
                                    to &amp; fro &amp; every thing seemed to be geting in a hubub. Some of our
                                    boys had been over &amp; were bringing away straps &amp; new parts of
                                    ringing [rigging?]. After breakfast I went over. The magazine was one conglomerated
                                    mass of all sorts of guns, pitched in from the top, some in boxes never opened
                                    &amp; which had smashed scattering the new bright barrelled pieces in all sorts
                                    of shapes. Others had been pitched in from the top by <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-054-2-093"/> arm loads. Here were <placeName>

                                    high as $40. I suppose there were 1500 in this hole. I passed on into the
                                    commissary where hundreds of soldiers had collected. At the far end the
                                    accoutrements for small arms &amp; cavelry were stacked in boxes to the top of
                                    the building. The top of these were covered with boys with axes &amp; hatchets
                                    prying of [f] the lids &amp; sling the contents to the hundreds that stood
                                    around. They were yelling &amp; talking &amp; grabing &amp; snatching
                                    &amp; the greatest excitement existed As fas[t] as one box was emptied it was
                                    pitched off &amp; another opened. The Infantry were geting new cartridge boxes
                                    belts &amp; straps. Cavelry &amp; artilery were geting new bridles, girths,
                                    martingales sword knots &amp; c. As it was a general pitch in I availed myself
                                    of the opportunity &amp; got me a new rig out &amp; out except the gun. A
                                    great many of our boys that had no guns or guns out of rig got new ones of the same

                                    But this high slashing destructive operation soon got to such a pitch that the
                                    officers had to put a stop to it, &amp; a guard was placed over the things. But
                                    with an order from their Captain or a commissioned officer with them, any one could
                                    get every thing he wanted. This afternoon I took 10 men &amp; loaded 7 wagons of
                                    ammunition. We were ordered this morning to cook two days rations &amp; be ready
                                    to march at any time. But this was a very slight job as we had very little to cook.
                                    Beef was all. Our beans &amp; rice we could not carry cooked. We had a little

                        <p>I am tired out with a hard days march of 16 miles. We were called up last night at
                                    just 12 m &amp; marched out at 1½ oclock. The road was awful dusty
                                    &amp; the day hot. I came nearer giving out to day than I ever did before
                                    &amp; the boys generaly are foot sore &amp; lame shouldered. About a half
                                    dozen picked up old Government mules along the road so thin you can almost see
                                    through them. &amp; have them loaded with knapsacks swung across their backs.
                                    belonging to the weakest men. They lead them along with straps &amp; roaps, it
                                    is rather amusing to hear the remarks made to them by the boys. The old camp ground
                                    &amp; valey at the ford look natural, but are all grown up with rank grass
                                    &amp; weeds. As the season has been very dry, water is very scarce. So we have
                                    to use river water. I have just been down for water. Right on the bank I passed over
                                    the last remains of two old mules. Found 6 or 8 men in swiming about 30 yards above
                                    &amp; 10 or 12 washing their feet &amp; hands &amp; faces right where we
                                    had to get the water. But we didnt know the differance after the coffee was made. I
                                    took a good bathe &amp; washed &amp; dried my socks. Papaws are just ripe
                                    along the river &amp; of the very finest quality. I have eaten so many that I am

                        <p>Just 3 months ago today we marched from Rodgers Gap to <placeName>

                                    as tired. It has been a better day for marching than yesterday. It rained just as we
                                    started &amp; laid the dust &amp; has been cloudy nearly all day. But some

                                    of the road &amp; rest. I among them for the first time. At Flat lick we took
                                    the right hand road leading to Winchester. It is the best Mt road I ever saw,
                                    &amp; the country is much better that that we passed through last spring going
                                    to the Ford. Corn looks fine, houses look neat &amp; every man has a patch of
                                    sugar cane. We had this morning for breakfast a little piece of corn bread &amp;
                                    raw bacon, on this we marched all day (also coffee,) and to night we have the same.</p>

                        <p>To day we have marched about 14 miles. The country geting better, it is, <hi rend="i">rather</hi>, a narrow valey. The road runs right down Goos creek. The corn is
                                    as fine as any I ever saw in Ind. &amp; houses begin to look civilized. I saw
                                    this morning standing in a door a pretty girl, with a neat, stylish red dress on
                                    &amp; hoops. The first thing of the kind I have seen for I cant tell how long.
                                    It realy done me good. The old Government <hi rend="i">pack</hi> mules have
                                    increased to about 20 or 30, a perfect train. We had for breakfast this morning
                                    about 4 spoons full of rice after it was cooked, &amp; some raw meat &amp;
                                    coffee. This we marched on all day.</p>
                        <p>We passed two salt works one woods. the other Old Col Garreds about a mile up the
                                    creek from here. They were both in opperation &amp; the flores were covered with
                                    nice white salt. The creek water is so salty we can hardly use it. Fresh water is
                                    scarce. We are camped right between Old Col &amp; young Col Garreds houses which
                                    are about 3/4 of a mile apart. The Old Col is a strong secesh. But his son is strong

                                    got it baked up at a house. It was made up with just water &amp; salt &amp;
                                    not half done but I thought it was the best bread I ever ate.</p>

                        <p>This morning we made our flour up with water &amp; salt, made it in thin cakes
                                    &amp; baked it on our plates set up before the fire it ate well &amp; no

                                    I saw a great many darkies, &amp; several of them the very same fellows that I
                                    saw leave Crab Orchard the 2nd day of last January singing their corn songs. One
                                    fellow, that I saw dance the jigg at Colwells, knew some of our boys, &amp;
                                    seemed as glad to see them as a brother. He walked with us about a mile. I am
                                    writing under the shade of a big elm tree just across the creek opposite the camp.
                                    The 2nd Tenn &amp; 49th Ind have just come in &amp; passed down on this side
                                    of the creek to camp. The 49th came in playing Dixey. Some other Regt went down the
                                    other side. Also Fosters Battery. They say that every thing was destroyed before
                                    they left the Gap. A lot of the boys are in swiming, &amp; some laying under the
                                    shade of the trees along the bank. This elm tree I am siting under is about 7 or 8
                                    feet in diameter. About the largest I ever saw. I am hungry as a wolf, &amp;
                                    must go &amp; see if our beef is boiled, &amp; try &amp; <hi rend="i">worry</hi> down a small piece. A Corporel in the Reg by the name of Higgins<hi rend="sup">74</hi> took sick Thursday &amp; died last night The water is
                                    very salty &amp; not fit to use. Although last night when we came in, tired
                                    thirsty &amp; hungry we pitched into it &amp; cooked &amp; made our
                                    coffee of it. Last night while I was asleep with my blanket drawn over my head some
                                    fellow took hold of my cut which was fastened to my haversack. In fumbling with the
                                    tin he woke me. I threw the blanket from of my head &amp; yelled at him, he <hi rend="i">skedaddled</hi> double quick leaving the cut behind him. he belonged to

                                    water. The case looked pretty billious, but we all were willing to stand any thing,
                                    with a prospect ahead of us of geting once more into civilizeation. But we did not
                                    find it as bad as expected. The road lay mostly along creek beds &amp; along
                                    these pools &amp; holes of water still stood which furnished us with plenty. 8

                                    coffee. We had to mix the flour up with water &amp; salt &amp; bake it on

                                    the boys yelled &amp; cheered, for it was the first steam machine we had seen in

                                    burned a fine steam flour mill that morning. This left the people without any thing.
                                    They had to get their meal as we did, by gritting it. We crossed the river &amp;

                                    went above us &amp; layed down behind a beach tree. Hill told him that he would
                                    get left when we were called up. But he said there was no danger. In about an hour
                                    &amp; a half we were called up in a great hurry. I intended to go &amp; wake
                                    Dell But they hurried us out so that by the time I got my things on I had forgotten
                                    all about him. The next morning he was missed &amp; has not been heard from
                                    since. I suppose the Reble cavelry picked him up, for they followed close at our
                                    heals for that purpose. We marched about 5 miles over the worst road I ever saw
                                    &amp; it was so dark you could scarcely see your file leader We came up to the
                                    rest of our Brigade &amp; camped on each side of the road. The 25th marched at
                                    daylight, our Company was rear guard, &amp; we were bothered greatly with the
                                    wagons on starting. About 3 P.M. we reached the North fork <geogName>Ky
                                    river</geogName> where we found one of our Reg &amp; the 14th Ky camped in its
                                    bed. Here we had to wait until all the train passed. We had an immence hill to climb
                                    on the opposite side &amp; the sand was very deep, which made very hard pulling.
                                    The men had to shove the nearly <hi rend="i">empty</hi> wagon all the way up. It was
                                    long after dark before we moved on. We had to climb the hill or Mt single file to
                                    keep out of the way of the wagons. This was very tiresome, &amp; took a long
                                    time. We then marched 6 miles down a gradual slope without one halt, &amp; when
                                    we saw the camp fires away below us, the men cheered &amp; yelled, although they
                                    were completely tired out &amp; hundreds lay along the road in the fence
                                    corners. Why Colonels will march their men so I cant tell. They ride &amp; carry
                                    nothing we walk &amp; carry all. We received orders on marching into camp to be
                                    ready to march at 3 A M Now the same old tune commenced. We had every thing to
                                    prepare for next day. No rations were given us. Fences were torn down, fires built,

                                    sand, right along the bank of little sandy it soon dried up &amp; made splendid
                                    marching. We began to find Union people all along the road, &amp; they had given

                                    of once more seeing free soil. Very few stopped for supper, but rolled up in our
                                    blankets &amp; were soon a sleep.</p>

                                    to wade the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> at this point. We drew crackers to day,

                                    to wade nearly a hundred yards on this side. My shoes got knocked off, &amp; I
                                    had to take it barefoot. I marched so about 6 miles. My feet were begining to get
                                    very sore. One of the boys let me have his shoes &amp; I made the trip fine. The

                                    smiling faces. This made us feel good, &amp; more than once loud cheers went up

                                    am sorry to have her go. Our camp is in a very bad place for rainey weather. But we
                                    have straw &amp; rail sheds which keep us quite warm &amp; dry. We expect to

                    1929-1933.</hi> By Robert H. Ferrell. Yale Historical Publications, Studies 17. (<placeName>

            <p>No one would contend that the period 1929-1933 marked any decisive turning point in the history of
                    American foreign policy, like the period 1914-1919, say, or 1939-1945. And yet the decisions that
                    President Herbert Hoover and his Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, made and the policies that
                    they implemented did in some measure affect the disintegration of the world order that was then in
                    progress and would soon culminate in the tragic events of the late 1930's. In this
                    thoughtfully conceived and brilliantly written study the author, an assistant professor of history
                    at Indiana University, has told how and why all this happened.</p>
            <p>The author has organized his narrative around the major events in American foreign policy during the
                    Hoover administration. His accounts of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> Naval Conference of 1930, the Manchurian crisis, the Shanghai incident, the World
                    Disarmament Conference, the emergence of a new Latin American policy, and the World Economic
                    Conference are all quite full and satisfying. The story of these events was already a familiar one,
                    and the author has not added anything particularly new to our knowledge about the main outlines.</p>
            <p>Having said this, one should hasten to add that this book is a notable achievement and a significant
                    contribution to the literature of recent American history. For one thing Professor Ferrell has
                    brought all the fragments together and constructed the whole story, in all its interrelated
                    complexity, for the first time. Moreover, he has done prodigious, even massive, research in the
                    personal papers of the American principals, in the American and Japanese archives, and in a variety
                    of other sources. The results are everywhere evident in this volume—in the richness and
                    newness of its detail, in the freshness of its approach, and, best of all, in the obvious
                    authenticity of the narrative.</p>
            <p>There is, moreover, new light here on the personalities and motivations of the men who guided the
                    American ship of state during the period 1929-1933. The portraits of Hoover, Stimson, William R.
                    Castle, Charles G. Dawes, and others that emerge from these pages are vivid, sympathetic yet
                    critical, and wonderfully revealing. They are portraits of men caught up in the greatest economic
                    cataclysm of modern times, struggling to apply outworn remedies to new situations, and failing nobly
                    on the whole. The portrait of Stimson that the author draws, incidentally, is perhaps the most
                    significant of all, for it tends to confirm the unfavorable one that Professor R. N. Current
                    depicted in <hi rend="i">Secretary Stimson, a Study in Statecraft.</hi> Not least among Professor
                    Ferrell's contributions is his bibliographical essay, which surveys the immense sources and
                    literature of his period with thoroughness and revealing commentary.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">American Diplomacy in the Great Depression</hi> is the kind of book that will evoke
                    admiration and considerable controversy at one and the same time. The controversy, it should be
                    said, will rise not over the author's excellent methods but over some of his
                    interpretations. To this reviewer, for example, it seems that he has given altogether too much
                    weight to the depression as the cause of the collapse of the international political order in the
                    early 1930's. No one would argue that the depression was not momentously significant; the
                    question is whether other factors were also of major importance. This reviewer would emphasize more
                    than Professor Ferrell did the isolationist traditions and ideals of the American people and
                    especially the essentially mediocre quality of the political leadership of the democracies during
                    this period. It is begging the point somewhat to say (as Professor Ferrell does) that Hoover,
                    Stimson, and others were able men. What the world needed desperately and did not have was great
                    leadership.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this reviewer has to enter a word of dissent about the way that the author deals with the
                    Manchurian crisis. His treatment of this matter is really quite excellent on the descriptive level,
                    but he fails to confront what is the most important question that can be asked about American policy
                    during this episode. It is whether Stimson's policy of setting the American government in
                    stern opposition to Japanese imperialism in Manchuria bore any substantial relation to the national
                    interests of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. This reviewer is not here suggesting that this or that answer would be correct, only
                    that Professor Ferrell does not really grapple with the problem.</p>
            <p>These of course are matters of individual judgment, and such criticisms are quite unimportant in view
                    of the total achievement of this volume. Professor Ferrell's first study on the Kellogg
                    Pact revealed his ability at monographic writing. The present volume shows that he has mastered the
                    techniques of general writing. We con all look forward to his promised third volume on the foreign
                    policy of the first Roosevelt administration.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A History of Presidential Elections.</hi> By Eugene H. Roseboom. (<placeName>

            <p>H. L. Mencken once described our presidential elections as quadrennial circuses, and on many
                    occasions the proceedings at the national conventions and the antics of campaigns would seem to
                    justify such a conclusion. Yet presidential elections are necessary in the functioning of our
                    Republic, and they are a vital part of our national history. Moreover, they have been a source of
                    wonder and mystery both to the politician and the scholar. For no one can be absolutely certain what
                    a national convention will do or what way the voters will turn, and likewise no one can be
                    absolutely certain why a candidate has won or lost. This element of uncertainty and guessing has
                    made Presidential elections an elusive and exciting game for everyone in the country.</p>
            <p>While there has been a profusion of literature about American politics—leaders, campaigns,
                    parties, theories, and so forth—little has <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-054-2-107"/> been
                    written in the way of a connected account about the struggles that take place every four years for
                    the presidency. Edward Stanwood's <hi rend="i">History of the Presidency</hi>, which comes
                    closest to this, is outdated and has little to say about the elections of the twentieth century.
                    Professor Roseboom's study fills the need of treating our presidential elections as
                    distinguishable and as important events in our national history. His objective is "to
                    present the essential facte about conventions, campaigns, and elections, briefly to assess the
                    effectiveness of Presidents and other important party figures as political leaders, to indicate the
                    more significant Congressional struggles of a political character, and to explain the trends of
                    politics in the social and economic settings of the different periods, with particular attention to
                    change."</p>
            <p>This was a formidable task, but Professor Roseboom has done very well indeed, and has produced a very
                    useful volume that will long serve the needs of all those interested in American politics. The book
                    is a convenient summary of the main developments of presidential politics, and in general it
                    reflects the latest and best scholarship on these matters. While the book is a popular account that
                    will have a greater interest and use for the general reader and for the undergraduate, it will be a
                    handy reference for the serious student of American politics, Everyone will enjoy the lively manner
                    in which it has been written, and everyone can profit from the selective bibliography that Professor
                    Roseboom has prepared.</p>
            <p>The problem of emphasis and selection was a very difficult one in writing this book, and Professor
                    Roseboom anticipated criticism on this point. Overall he has done very well in solving this problem,
                    but the book might have been even more useful had he given greater attention and care to the really
                    significant and meaningful elections like those of 1800, 1828, 1860, 1912, and 1932. In all of these
                    there was a meaningful division of the parties, and the voters were presented with fundamental
                    differences in political issues and questions. The treatment of these elections in the same way as
                    the other elections is one shortcoming of this book.</p>

                    brings into focus the position of the Negro in 1958 as well as 1858. Mr. Paul Angle, who edited the
                    volume, feels the arguments of the debaters evolved around three questions: the extension of
                    slavery, the status of the Negro, and the rights of the states to regulate the Negro's
                    status as they saw fit. However, one must admit that all three of the subjects have a common
                    denominator, which is the Negro.</p>

                    the press at each meeting are presented.</p>
            <p>The reviewer at one time made a synopsis outline of the arguments in each of the seven debates and he
                    was struck by the constant repetition. Angle in the preface of his book states, "In the
                    debates there was much repetition,'' and again concludes, "Douglas
                    covered much the same ground" as he had on a previous occasion. In this day when
                    condensation in literature is so popular it is to be regretted that we do not have the repeats
                    expurgated and a summary of what each debater had to say on these and other pertinent subjects which
                    were under discussion: Compromise Measures, Dred Scott, Extension of Slavery, House Divided,

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1957. Pp. xv, 412. Illustrations. $5.00.)</head>
            <p>It is now almost axiomatic to speak of the diversity in the South, of the vast differences in the
                    dialects, the regions, and the peoples of the section, even in the pre-Civil War era. Miss
                    Jones's selections from the diaries, journals, and letters of the residents of and visitors
                    to those "Souths" is again a sharp reminder of this fact. For here in an endeavor
                    to recapture only a segment of the pre-war South, the Plantation South, the variety within the area
                    is more noticeable than the similarity. In a limited way the author seems to recognize this
                    variegation by dividing her book into three main parts, one each for the tobacco, rice, and cotton
                    South. Although a convenient arrangement, it is nonetheless a somewhat artificial one. While there
                    were distinctions between the rice planter of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> coastal lands and the tobacco farmer of the <placeName>

                    location and agricultural pursuit was not the only basis for differentiation. Other factors were
                    important: the generation to which an individual belonged, the political arrangements and
                    leadership, and the blend of memory and habit that established a local tradition. None of these can
                    be overlooked. These additional features are also illustrated in the passages of Miss
                    Jones's anthology, but the reader must look for them and not allow the author's
                    neat organization to form the pattern of his thinking.</p>
            <p>Although confirming that not even the Plantation South was of one mind, the book also illustrates
                    another common notion concerning the <hi rend="i">ante-bellum</hi> South—that the force
                    giving it unity from diversity, oneness from many, was the institution of Negro slavery. Whether he
                    was from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Tidewater or the rich cotton lands of the <geogName>Mississippi valley</geogName> the
                    Southern planter was (almost without exception) determined in the defense of an institution upon
                    which, so he felt, his economic survival and way of life ultimately rested. Views of slavery and
                    treatment of slaves might vary from region to region or even from plantation to plantation, but the
                    general objective of the Southern slave owner was the maintenance of the South's peculiar
                    institution. Even though he might object to the system in principle, the individual planter saw no
                    easy solution to the many problems of emancipation and thus suffered the continuance of an
                    institution that the world had outgrown.</p>
            <p>Slavery was the topic of interest pervading the entire area. The question of slaves and slavery
                    occupied considerable space in the writings of the pre-war Southerner, at least in the writings
                    chosen by Miss Jones. Practically all of the selections discuss it in one fashion or another.
                    Sometimes there is only a prosaic schedule of the daily tasks of the slaves (pp. 245-255), at other
                    times there is a philosophical reflection concerning the effects of the institution on the South and
                    its people (p. 174), but at all times it was a matter of serious concern. Slavery was also of
                    foremost interest to travelers in the South. The appraisals of many were reasonably accurate and
                    fair-minded, while others allowed a dislike of the institution to color their judgment of its actual
                    practice. Almost everyone mentioned it and felt that somehow it accounted for the South's
                    distinctive characteristics.</p>
            <p>The book contains little that is new in the way of ideas, but it does offer evidence for many of the
                    old ones. Naturally the selections are limited in that they deal with only one phase of the pre-war
                    South, the plantation, but after all that is the author's purpose. As a slice of plantation
                    life in the Old South the selections are representative. The anthology covers a wide range including
                    all aspects of the plantation from labor management to entertainment to weddings and honeymoons.
                    There are excerpts from old standbys (such as Frederick Law Olmsted and Frances Kemble) and more
                    obscure sources. Occasionally one feels that too little attention is devoted to the critics of the
                    plantation regime. The brief but enlightening introductions that Miss Jones provides for each
                    selection are extremely helpful and contribute significantly to the worth of the book.</p>

                    concerning American legislative journals, declarations, statutes, and reports for the years

                    way for further work in the future.</p>
            <p>The first publication of the Continental Congress, Mr. Powell says, was the <hi rend="i">Association</hi> in 1774, calling for American non-importation and non-exportation in trade with
                    the mother country. Another interesting and influential document of the time was the <hi rend="i">Rules and Articles for the Better Government of the Troops.</hi> Of course, the Declaration of
                    Independence was a very important publication and is here expertly analyzed from the bibliographical
                    point of view. The author agrees with Hazelton and with Boyd that the Declaration was probably not
                    signed on July 4, though he admits that the known evidence is not conclusive. He proceeds to the
                    early national period where recently available records of the Congress are extensively used to show
                    the development of a system in governmental publishing. Since almost all public documents were
                    printed by Congressional order, the rolee of the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate
                    were central. Samuel A. Otis, serving in the latter office for many years, established a mode of
                    operations that was both efficient and enduring.</p>
            <p>Pleasingly written and well supported by research, this volume will interest librarians and
                    historians. It is hoped that an enterprising librarian, perhaps Mr. Powell himself, will be
                    stimulated to compile the bibliography which is now lacking. And it is certain that the historian
                    will benefit by Mr. Powell's <hi rend="i">caveat</hi> with respect to the older aids now on

               <hi rend="i">Farm Crisis, 1919-1923.</hi> By James H. Shideler. (Berkeley: University of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Press, 1957. Pp. x, 345. Notes, index. $5.00.)</head>
            <p>This book describes the period of greatest agrarian discontent between the Progressive movement and
                    the depression of 1929. The four years after World War I, so ably described by Professor Shideler.
                    were <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-054-2-111"/> a time of falling farm prices. Between June, 1920, and
                    May, 1921, agricultural prices fell to one-third of their former value and farmers sustained an
                    estimated net loss of $6,225,000,000. At first the farmers blamed their troubles on the
                    Federal Reserve Board plus the usual group: railroads, grain elevators, meat packers, and commodity
                    exchanges. Solutions were sought both through the government and through self organization. Demand
                    for governmental help by the Farm Bureau and other farm organizations for higher tariffs, prevention
                    of foreign imports, and better credit facilities led to a meeting of six <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> congressmen in the office of Senator William S. Kenyon on November 13, 1920. This
                    meeting formed the beginning of the Farm Bloc in Congress, a group which eventually pushed through
                    higher tariffs, farm loan acts, regulation of stockyards and packers, exemption of farmers'
                    cooperatives from the anti-trust act, and better warehousing legislation. Other farmers favored self
                    help and pushed cooperative marketing ventures of all types, the most important of which was the
                    Sapiro plan in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. These marketing ideas satisfied the Republican administration much better than
                    governmental intervention of any kind.</p>
            <p>Harding's Secretary of Agriculture, Henry C. Wallace, was sincerely interested in helping
                    the farmers. He organized a strong department, improved the annual year book, developed crop and
                    market reporting services, and created the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. These developments soon
                    brought him into conflict with Herbert Hoover's Department of Commerce. Hoover also was an
                    empire builder and, through his interest in food control in the first World War, wanted foreign and
                    domestic marketing of agricultural products included in his department. Wallace had just as much
                    influence with Harding as did Hoover, but the Secretary of Commerce became more important when
                    Coolidge succeeded to the presidency.</p>
            <p>In 1922 farmers in many states defeated administration candidates for office and by this action
                    encouraged the formation of the LaFollette Progressive party of 1924. The years 1919-1923 saw the
                    development of the McNary-Haugen plan, later passed by Congress and vetoed by Coolidge, of the Farm
                    Board idea used by Hoover, and of the parity price proposal adopted by Franklin Roosevelt. The
                    details of these plans and ideas and how they waxed and waned among the various farm groups and in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> are presented in this book.</p>
            <p>Farm leaders who participated in these events should be encouraged to read this book and to comment
                    on the accuracy of its facts and its implications, so that pertinent information can be added to
                    that already known. Another book should trace the agricultural discontent during the Coolidge and
                    Hoover administrations. Unfortunately Shideler's volume has no formal bibliography of the
                    books used; hence the reader is forced to rely entirely on the footnotes for this information.</p>

                    $6.00.)</head>
            <p>The territory covered in this study stretches from Upper Silesia to the English Channel and North
                    Sea, but omits the British Isles, partly because they have been intensively studied by their own
                    scholars. The time span is from the early eighteenth century to 1956, thereby including the early
                    years of the European Coal and Steel Community. The tale is told up to 1913 by Professor Pounds, a
                    geographer well versed in coal and iron geology, technology, and history, and author of a noteworthy
                    volume on the Ruhr; then carried on, with some inevitable overlap, by Professor Parker, an economist
                    and economic historian who has served various government agencies concerned with the German economy
                    since 1945.</p>
            <p>Professor Pounds devotes about eighty pages (Part I) to the eighteenth century "Origins of
                    the Modern Industry," then 140 pages (Part 11) to the vast nineteenth century
                    "Transformation and Growth" in production of coal, iron, and steel. The research
                    has been far flung; the technical, economic, and legal factors are adequately
                    emphasized—the geological too much so; but the presentation is rather dreary. Each
                    coalfield and each iron-producing region in each country is surveyed for the eighteenth century,
                    then done all over again for the nineteenth. The result is often like reading a gazetteer. Some
                    facts and names are repeated, as when Freiherr vom Stein turns up five times without much addition
                    to our knowledge of what he did. Some places are hard to find on any of the numerous maps, and hard
                    to read (e.g., p. 82). The statement about the "spread of the [French] railway
                    net" between 1830-1850 (pp. 140-141) is not supported by the footnote reference or by any
                    other writer on French railroad history. The relative importance attributed to the Ruhr coal output
                    on pages 220 and 242 differs markedly from that indicated in the graph on page 213. And the word
                    "insignificant" in the middle of page 52 needs to be deprived of its first
                    syllable.</p>
            <p>Professor Parker's assignment is much simpler and he does it much more readably. The period
                    of rapid expansion, technical change, and regional concentration came to a sudden close with World
                    War I. Henceforth production moved "from catastrophe to climax in three successive waves
                    during the two world wars and the intervening Great Depression" (p. 250). There were no
                    great basic technical improvements or discoveries of new mineral resources to permit lower costs.
                    Demand fluctuated violently, with little upward trend. Integration and cartels could not provide
                    stability and security, much less revive the dearly desired former pace of growth. At best
                    "the long run situation was one of gradual expansion" (p. 345), but political
                    events bedevilled that situation. Whether the Coal and Steel Community can exorcise the devil
                    Professor Parker admits it is still too early to guess. He devotes only seventeen pages to the
                    Community's origin, plan, and "opportunity," and emerges with his fingers
                    crossed. He hopes that "liberal-minded" men and governments will continue to hold
                    the reins <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-054-2-113"/> of power, and is cheered by the "upsurge of
                    coal and steel production in all the major European regions in 1955 and 1956" (p. 364). But
                    will the figures of 1958 tell another tale in Europe, as in America?</p>

                    usually fruitless expeditions against the Indians.</p>
            <p>To bring order out of chaos-a rather vain hope considering the weakness of Congress—Harmar
                    established a garrison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> under Major Hamtramck, an officer particularly fitted for the post because of his
                    French Canadian background and his Catholic faith. At Fort Knox, as the garrison came to be called,
                    Hamtramck spent six miserable years, 1787-1793.</p>
            <p>Hamtramck's letters relate innumerable hardships-sickness, food shortages, murderous Indian
                    raids, British and Spanish intrigues, arrears in pay, and countless others. Harmar does his best to

            <p>Miss Thornbrough's editorial work is to be commended highly. An excellent introduction shows

                    Knox and a map of the western country are included. Almost all persons mentioned in the letters are
                    identified in footnotes, but perhaps there should have been more attention to terms such as
                    "livers" (<hi rend="i">livres</hi>, p. 74), "Belle Reiver"
                        (<geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, p. 129), and "Riviere a 1'Anguille"

            <p>Dr. Tippy, director of the Archives of DePauw university and Indiana Methodism and former pastor of
                    Christ Church (Methodist) in <placeName>

                    </placeName> City, has given in this slender volume an interesting and able portrayal of
                    "the life and times of Robert Richford Roberts, 1778-1843."</p>
            <p>He has given more of the life than of the times actually. If the book has any single deficiency, the
                    blame lies not with the author but with the paucity of materials from which he has worked. Direct
                    biographical data in any considerable corpus are limited to a statement dictated by Bishop Roberts
                    while sitting for a portrait painted at Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw). Combined with
                    scattered reminiscences of those who knew the bishop, a few sermon fragments, and some records of
                    the Methodist Conferences over which he presided, the primary sources still have a gaunt, underfed
                    appearance. One has the impression that Dr. Tippy has had to pad his narrative in order to
                    compensate for this defect.</p>
            <p>But the padding, while historically risky, arises from sound intuition. For Bishop Roberts's
                    significance to nineteenth century Methodism and to frontier Indiana is unquestionably bulkier than
                    the record which he and others failed to leave. Born in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a boy, rising from reticent obscurity to reluctant eminence in the church, settling
                    in Indiana in 1819, traveling throughout the church (a duty which has apparently always been laid
                    upon bishops), giving much energy to the founding and proportionate substance to the strengthening
                    of Indiana Asbury, preaching effectively but undramatically-all resulted in a quiet, compelling
                    piety and in a broad, refined statesmanship which places him among the primary if lesser known
                    figures of the Midwest and of the Methodist Church.</p>
            <p>Indiana readers will be especially attracted by the Hoosier geographical and historical backgrounds
                    in this very human portrait. Indiana University readers will be interested in the author's
                    chapter on the controversy between early Methodists and the officials of the state university,
                    leading ultimately to the founding of DePauw, although this chapter contains no new details.</p>
            <p>The book is unfortunately marred by several typographical errors.</p>
            <p>The style is facile but not flowery, the scholarship accurate but not pedantic. Withal, Frontier

               <hi rend="i">History of the North Indiana Conference, 1917-1956.</hi> By Frederick A. Norwood.
                    (North Indiana Conference Historical Society, 1967. Pp. 331. Illustrations, graphs, appendices,
                    index.)</head>
            <p>During the last five years histories have been published concerning all three Indiana conferences of
                    the Methodist Church: Jack J. Detzler's <hi rend="i">History of the Northwest Conference of
                        the Methodist Church</hi> (1953); <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-054-2-115"/> Herbert L.
                    Heller's <hi rend="i">Indiana Conference of the Methodist Church, 1892-1956</hi> (1956);
                    and the present volume, a sequel to <hi rend="i">A History of the North Indiana Conference of the
                        Methodist Episcopal Church from Its Organization in 1844 to the Present</hi>, written in 1917 by
                    H. N. Herrick and William W. Sweet.</p>
            <p>After a quick resume of Indiana Methodism in the nineteenth century, Dr. Norwood plunges into the
                    principal developments and highlights of Methodism in the North Indiana Conference during the
                    twentieth century. Buildings and finances, conferences and other meetings, and homes for children
                    and the aged are given attention. But emphasis is also placed on Christian education, lay Methodism,
                    social problems and concerns, preaching and evangelism, and the missionary work of Methodists in the
                    North Indiana Conference. Now and then the author indicates that the Methodists of this Conference
                    have generally been conservative regarding innovations, yet he offers much evidence that nonetheless
                    significant changes have taken place.</p>
            <p>Dr. Norwood's account is readable and well grounded regarding the main currents of
                    Methodism. Certain parts, however, are the result of composite research and writing and these parts
                    are of uneven value. Appendices list superintendents, ministerial appointments, ordinations,
                    retirements, lay readers, etc. Hundreds of small individual pictures are included. In short, this
                    book has a number of built-in sales features. Even so, the pictures, lists, and the like have value
                    as historical compilations.</p>
            <p>Though the addiction of numerous Methodists to the infamous Ku Klux Klan of the 1920's is
                    rightfully condemned, the Methodists in this book are not quite real persons. They get along
                    remarkably well together and exhibit few outcroppings of original sin. The men and women here
                    portrayed have a bit of gloss which prevents this history from being aa impartial and accurate as it
                    might otherwise have been. Moreover, one gains the impression that perhaps this problem bothered Dr.
                    Norwood as he wrote this volume.</p>

            <p>The problem of dealing with convicted criminals has long been of concern to society. In spite of
                    intensive attention to this problem, to date comparatively little progress has been made in finding
                    solutions. <hi rend="i">The Prison at <placeName>

                        </placeName>
               </hi> makes the following important contributions to our thinking on this: 1) It
                    rounds out and adds considerably to the historical analysis of the very important phase of American
                    penology which is usually referred to 88 the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> system. Since the scope of the book is limited to the description and analysis of the
                    Cherry Hill Prison between 1829 and 1913, it was <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-054-2-116"/> possible for
                    the authors to go into considerable detail and to provide the reader with a solid foundation for his
                    own evaluation of this experiment. This is particularly important since frequently the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> system has been described only superficially and in that process some of the essential
                    features of the system have been overlooked or misinterpreted. 2) <hi rend="i">The Prison at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> also indicates some of the factors which make progress in this field so
                    difficult. It makes it clear that in the past ideas in the field of penology were not evaluated on
                    their merits but were quickly engulfed by a host of other considerations, such as political,
                    economic, religious, and emotional. Current studies in crime and penology have shown that many
                    important human motivations are involved on all levels of consideration of crime.</p>
            <p>By showing the complexity of motivations which on the one hand led to the development of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> system, its execution and its defense, and on the other hand to criticisms of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> system and the espousal of the so-called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                    </placeName> system, the book shows clearly the difficulty of dealing with this issue on an
                    unemotional basis. In doing this the authors show the need for scientific research in the field of
                    penology. This case study of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> system also demonstrates clearly that every phase of penology requires careful and
                    constant attention, from the physical structure of prisons to the training and supervision of every
                    guard. The effectiveness of the most carefully considered general plan can be destroyed if the
                    entire system is not carefully coordinated. To this reviewer this point is the most significant
                    contribution of the book.</p>
            <p>The book is well written. Its style and treatment of the subject matter should appeal to everybody
                    interested in these problems, regardless of the reader's background. While the book is
                    written for the student of penology, it does not assume knowledge of any of the background data but
                    is complete in itself as far as this phase of American penology is concerned.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Let There Be Light</hi> is a comprehensive account of the birth and development of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s electric utility industry, with occasional glances at the national scene. At
                    appropriate points the author breaks the narrative to explore the complexities of volts, amperes,
                    hydroelectric dams, and holding companies. The illuminating discussion of difficult scientific and
                    financial concepts which often elude the layman is one of the strongest features of the book.</p>
            <p>The organization of his material reflects Mr. McDonald's fidelity to the inductive method.
                    He has treated the origins and early history of electric utilities in practically all of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s municipalities as a prelude to generalizations about state-wide
                    developments. In the <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-054-2-117"/> process, he has assembled a prodigious
                    number of facts about the vicissitudes of short-lived, local utility corporations. He includes
                    information about traction, hydro-electric, and central station enterprises, and their relationship.
                    The reader is led through a maze of corporation failures, mergers, and reorganizations. Mr. McDonald
                    makes a conscientious effort to draw meaningful conclusions from this bewildering array of facts. He
                    succeeds rather well, but only the most determined reader can proceed through the vast stretches of
                    municipal history which separate summary paragraphs without losing the thread.</p>
            <p>As long as the author concentrates on the scientific and financial aspects of the history of electric
                    utilities, he deserves unqualified admiration. When he examines the interaction between utilities
                    and political movements, he is less persuasive. His sympathy is with the utility companies in every
                    controversy. Readers are prepared for this viewpoint in the preface which postulates the futility of
                    all attempts to understand the action of a group "in terms of any set of standards but
                    their own." The author's philosophy of history thus commits him to view the
                    utilities only from their own standpoint. He performs a valuable service by correcting the biases of
                    New DeaI historians who were excessively critical of business. Yet it is difficult to accept such a
                    lofty estimate of the motives and behavior of electric utility executives as that which appears on
                    page 200. It is equally difficult to digest the implication that politicians exist primarily to
                    torment businessmen.</p>
            <p>The author might have achieved a more balanced perspective had he devoted space to personalities, but
                    his pioneers and promoters are consigned to the background. They function only as the instruments of
                    economic forces, and never achieve autonomy as men with fears, appetites, and emotions. Fortunately,
                    history thrives on controversy, and Mr. McDonald has given historians plenty to think about.</p>

            <p>Although this book is a history of the militia of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, or of the National Guard as it is now known, it is also a study in American
                    federalism. In beginning his initial chapter Professor Riker points out that "each unit of
                    the Guard is responsible to two distinct governments and serves both alternately. Each unit receives
                    financial support from two distinct appropriations recommended by two distinct chief executives and
                    passed by two distinct legislatures. In consequence, each unit of the Guard has, presumably, two
                    distinct loyalties at the same time. This form of organization is in sharp contrast to a fundamental
                    principle of military theory that a force ought to have one and only one commander." In one
                    sense this volume uses the militia or National Guard as the basis for a case study in federalism.</p>
            <p>After reminding readers that the colonial militia constituted an important part of the Revolutionary
                    army and after an attempt to <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-054-2-118"/> define or at least describe
                    federalism, Professor Riker discusses the origin of the sections concerning the militia in the
                    Constitution of 1787. Compromise was writ large here too! Soon came the Second Amendment which
                    further anchored the militia in federalism. Then the Militia Act of 1792 which established the
                    principle that all free white male citizens between 18 and 45 years of age were subject to militia
                    duty. This was "the seventeenth and eighteenth century version of universal military
                    training" (p. 21). By the middle of the nineteenth century, however, "the states
                    had, through incompetence and inaction, utterly abandoned" (p. 21) this principle. But in
                    80 doing they invented the <hi rend="i">volunteer</hi> militia system as the forerunner of the
                    National Guard.</p>
            <p>The militia, organized as intended by the founding fathers, was used in the War of 1812 and in
                    various Indian wars. It was only slightly used in the Mexican War and virtually not at all in the
                    Civil War and the Spanish War; these wars were fought mainly by volunteer militia. Meanwhile, as the
                    National Guard evolved out of the volunteer militia it become a sizeable proportion of the troops
                    used in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. Considerable attention is given to the
                    development of and recent problems regarding the National Guard. The use of the militia to control
                    or suppress strikes is also reviewed.</p>
            <p>Some minor errors here and there seem to be attributable to inadequate proofing. In addition, one
                    might question occasional items, both of fact and opinion, and the author may be a bit optimistic
                    about the continued vitality of American federalism. Nevertheless, here is the fruit of substantial
                    research in a concise and readable volume.</p>

            <p>What was the gun that shaped the American destiny? After wondering whether any such claim could be
                    made for any single gun, this reviewer tried to guess what it would be before looking inside the
                    book. His first thought was that it must be the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> rifle. Surely a good case could be made for the old stand-by of the frontiersman, for
                    that rifle which, with the benefit of the greased patch, showed such superiority in the Revolution
                    in the hands of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName>'s men. Or was it the Colt revolver, the weapon which had served so well in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> Revolution and in the Mexican War? Was it the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                    </placeName> rifle, the famed "seven-forked lightning" of the Civil War? Or was it
                    the Winchester, "the gun that won the West?" No, it was none of these. It was the
                    Sharps rifle and carbine which appeared in the 1850's and which had limited, though
                    significant, service in the Civil War.</p>
            <p>The author sketches the history of the Sharps in five very brief introductory chapters. In the second
                    of these, "The Sharps Gun in American History," he takes a few lines to mention
                    that the Sharps was used by emigrants moving westward, in the fighting in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, by John Brown, in the Civil War, and in buffalo hunting and railroad <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-054-2-119"/> building in the West, and that Custer's men did not have any
                    Sharps carbines for their "last stand." Demonstration of the significance of the
                    Sharps on all these occasions seems rather strained. It is difficult to believe that the fighting in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, or John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, was much different because
                    the weapon in use happened to be the Sharps. Undoubtedly the Sharps performed well when it was used
                    in the Civil War, and it was a favorite of Berdan's Sharpshooters, but surely the Spencer
                    and Henry repeaters—of which there were two or three times as many used, and which
                    affected operations considerably in the last year of the war—were of greater
                    significance.</p>
            <p>The principal value of this book is in its 133-page appendix which is an interesting compilation of
                    drawings, ordnance reports, testimonials, reproductions of advertisements, and patents covering the
                    Sharps firearms and patents. One of the prize exhibits is a reproduction of the targets fired by
                    Lieutenant L. C. Bruce with which he won the world championship in 1877—fourteen
                    bullseyes out of fifteen shots at 800 yards, twelve out of fifteen at 900 yards, and thirteen out of
                    fifteen at 1,000 yards, for a total score of 219 out of a possible 226, with a Sharps Long Range
                    Rifle. Altogether the book will be of greater interest to a gun collector than to the general
                    history reader.</p>

            <p>Adena is the archaeological designation for one of the major prehistoric burial mound complexes found
                    in the middle and upper <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> Valley. These mounds, some of which contain
                    several thousand cubic yards of earth, usually cover human skeletal remains, more or less
                    elaborately constructed tombs of earth and logs, and distinctive artifacts made of stone, bone,
                    shell, and copper. Almost all the information for Adena has been obtained from mounds; therefore an
                    over-all picture of Adena culture is not available.</p>
            <p>In 1945 the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> published <hi rend="i">The Adena People</hi> by William S. Webb and Charles E. Snow. It
                    was a comprehensive summary in trait list form of the then available data for Adena. It also
                    included sections on the chronological position of the burial complex and its relationship to other
                    prehistoric materials in the New World.</p>
            <p>As a result of continued excavation, much new data have accumulated in the intervening twelve years.
                    The Adena People, No. 2, is intended to make these additions available in a form consistent with the
                    earlier work and, because it is a supplement, both volumes must be consulted if one wishes to obtain
                    a picture of Adena mound structure and content.</p>
            <p>Two problems ultimately faced in every archaeological publication are those of time and space. The
                    recent development of radiocarbon dating techniques has provided dates from five Adena mounds. The
                    earliest is about 800 B.C.; the most recent is approximately 800 A.D. <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-054-2-120"/> The authors believe that the earlier of the two will eventually be
                    extended backward in time. A time span of more than sixteen hundred years is a long one and poses
                    problems of culture process.</p>
            <p>Adena mounds are the earliest such structures in the <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName> and the older
                    publication had hypothesized a Middle American origin for them. A chapter in the recent volume
                    contributed by Charles E. Snow reaffirms this position. Not only does the basic Adena physical type
                    have Middle American relationships, but the same is said to be true for "many distinctive
                    and diagnostic cultural traits" (p. 60). However, the senior authors locate "the
                    major traits of Adena" in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> as early as 2450 B.C. (p. 103). Without some clarification, this is confusing.</p>
            <p>Three Indiana archaeological sites are added to the Adena catalogue. The L. C. Lewis Stone Mound
                    (sic) in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby County</region>
                    </placeName> is clearly Adena and the Cato Site, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike County</region>
                    </placeName>, exhibits several Adena traits. However, the reviewer disagrees with the inclusion of
                    the Burkam (<hi rend="i">sic</hi>) Stone Mounds, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>
                    </placeName>, in this complex. Rather, recent evidence aligns them with a number of later sites,
                    both stone mounds and villages, found in southeastern Indiana, southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and designated the Newton Focus.</p>
            <p>This publication is certain to stimulate comments from the professional archaeologist. The less
                    specialized reader will find the description of Adena burial practices of interest. Combined with
                    the earlier <hi rend="i">Adena People</hi>, it will remain a standard reference for one of the major
                    prehistoric occupations in the <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName>.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Pictorial History of Protestantism.</hi> By Vergelius Ferm. (<placeName>

            <p>Because of the high cost of printing, relatively few histories today contain visual aids, despite the
                    fact that educators emphasize their value. Without such aids, one tends to imagine the geographical
                    location of place names and the physical features of persons and things, and the resulting images
                    are invariably inaccurate. To obtain correct images involves the process of erasing the incorrect
                    ones. For this reason, Vergelius Ferm's pictorial history of Protestantism fills an
                    important gap.</p>
            <p>It is the announced purpose of the author to use his selections of pictures to provide a clearer
                    conception of Protestantism "as a witness to something," but especially as
                    "a battle-name against unwholesome infringements (be they of creeds, councils, books,
                    catechisms, theology, ecclesiastical polity, confessions, heroes) against the onmoving forces of the
                    spirit of life itself" (p. xi). It is this interest which accounts for the large number of
                    pictures devoted to the struggle for religious liberty and to the consequent divisions within the
                    numerically great denominations as well as to the many lesser groups. The startling proliferation of
                    Protestantism is apparent particularly on the American scene. There are, for example, selections for
                    nine Lutheran bodies, three Presbyterian, three Baptist, and two Methodist, and also <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-054-2-121"/> for many small groups such as the Churches of God, Jehovah's
                    Witnesses, and the Pentecostal Holiness Church.</p>
            <p>The pictures and the accompanying text cover the history of Christian witness and protest from the
                    Council of Nicaea in 325 to the ecumenical movement of today. Because of the paucity of pictures for
                    the early centuries, they are uneven in kind, quality, and value. They include contemporary works
                    and imaginary reconstructions by later artists; old woodcuts and copper and steel engravings;
                    reproductions of seals, coats of arms, title pages of books, religious music, and city plans;
                    photographs of historical religious places, buildings, museum pieces, portraits, statues, and recent
                    religious leaders; and scenes from the Martin Luther film of the Lutheran Church Productions, Inc. A
                    few of the imaginary pictures are based on incorrect legend, such as the one showing Luther and his
                    family in front of a Christmas tree and another picturing Luther's meeting with Georg von
                    Frundsberg at the Diet of Worms. Taken as a whole, the selections are excellent, the reproductions
                    clear, and the author's comments helpful.</p>

            <p>It is perhaps as impossible to give a meaningful review of this volume in brief compass as it is to
                    picture all of America through carefully selected illustrations. Although hundreds of
                    pictures—many of them indeed beautiful and fascinating—are reproduced here,
                    the messages which pictures tell depend more upon what is in the mind and soul of the viewer than on
                    the pictures themselves. Possibly those who know America best, both her heritage and her grandeur,
                    will appreciate this volume more than those who are unfamiliar with her heritage, her historical
                    places and landscapes.</p>
            <p>The commentary is very readable and exhibits a good understanding of America's historical
                    development. Pictures of homes, places, and persons are included from all regions of the country and
                    from all of the forty-eight states. But the overall view is not always balanced. There is included
                    more of beauty than of sordidness and the illustrations are more inclusive for some than for other
                    facets of American life. Nevertheless, here is a selection of pictures well worthy of careful and
                    repeated observation. The illustrations are principally drawn from the eighteenth and nineteenth
                    centuries.</p>
            <p>Some will likely consider this volume a bit heavy with sentimental and patriotic nuances. It would,
                    however, be impossible accurately to portray American life, especially in the nineteenth century,
                    without such nuances. They, too, are a part of the American Heritage.</p>
