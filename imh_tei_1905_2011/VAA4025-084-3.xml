            <p rend="center">AUTHOR'S NOTE</p>
            <p>In the 1955 session of the Indiana General Assembly, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, situated in my Senate district, asked that the state double its support to
                    the school on a continuing and predictable basis. The university was then receiving public funds by
                    way of a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> property tax, which the state matched, but the money thus generated was not nearly
                    enough to meet the school'S needs. I knew that additional funds would not be easily come by
                    unless solid reasons were presented and the interest and support of the legislative leadership
                    obtained. To this end I put together the bits and pieces of the school'S history that I had
                    learned during my many years as a trustee, focusing upon the bitter political struggle that had
                    almost destroyed the school and fashioning the story into a political drama that I hoped would
                    command the sympathetic attention of the legislators. What follows is that story and the
                    legislature'S reaction to it. The article was given as a paper before the <placeName>

                    preceded only by Transylvania College in <placeName>

            <p>In December of that same year, 1801, Harrison and five other trustees of Jefferson Academy petitioned

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Congress for a donation of land to be used for the development of an
                    "Institution for the Education of Youth" similar to the one that had been granted
                    for an "institution on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Purchase on the Muskingum."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The petition was referred to
                    a three-man committee for consideration but apparently occasioned no congressional action. In
                    December, 1802, however, a "general convention of the [Indiana] Territory," called
                    and chaired by Harrison as governor, included in its list of "representations to the
                    Congress of the <placeName>

                    response to this petition of 1802 Congress in 1804 adopted an act for survey and disposal of public
                    lands and provided that in each of the three land districts established in Indiana Territory (namely
                    at <placeName>

                    designated by the secretary of the treasury.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Thus Harrison and his colleagues
                    were successful in obtaining a land grant as an endowment for the new institution of learning. The
                    grant consisted of a six-mile-square congressional township, which was set aside by Secretary of the
                    Treasury Albert Gallatin on October 10, 1806, comprising 23,040 acres located at Township 2 South,

            <p>In the territorial election of April 3, 1809, Jennings offered himself as the candidate of the

                    After two days' debate the House, somewhat unusually, refused to accept the report, and

            <p>Jennings became active in Congress as a disseminator of gossip and charges unfavorable to
                    Indiana'S territorial governor. He repeatedly introduced resolutions inimical to Harrison
                    and, bent upon "laying the groundwork for an impeachment," went so far as to lay
                    before President James <placeName>

                    Jennings aggressively promoted the admission of Indiana to the Union as the best way to get rid of
                    the territorial governor. When this event did occur in 1816, Jennings became a candidate for
                    governor of the new state and soundly trounced Thomas B. Posey, the candidate supported by Harrison
                    and the other prominent landholders of the area. The vote was 5,211 to 3,936—not a
                    landslide, but decisive. The Jennings forces were in charge.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    over $200,000. The details of these payments are interesting. In 1854 the Indiana Supreme

                            the state full authority to deal with its lands; (c) that the university charter had expired
                            in 1822 through failure to elect trustees; (d) the statute of limitations as well as adverse

                    second-hand campus in the U.S." was appropriate. A student union building was constructed
                    in 1959 and a library in 1960. The university was now in business on a much larger scale.</p>

                    Central Association of Colleges in 1956, and the school grew rapidly to its present size of 6,500
                    students, 40 percent of whom are in liberal arts transfer programs and 60 percent in the forty-three

            <p>In 1959 Lieutenant-Governor Crawford Parker, in a discussion with me, suggested that in light of the
                    substantial funds being furnished to the university by the state—together with the broad
                    powers of eminent domain given its board, which was at that time a self-perpetuating
                    body—provision should be made for appointment of some of the trustees of the university
                    by the governor. This proposal was acceptable to all concerned, and in 1959 the General Assembly
                    passed legislation which provided that the governor would appoint six trustees to the
                    university'S Board of Trustee.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    of over 6,500 students from all over Indiana. The continued growth to an institution of <hi rend="i">this size</hi> created financial pressures that required the state to furnish support in

            </p>
            <p>In 1976 the financial problems of the university reappeared, and the legislature, after having tried
                    to resolve them in 1975, felt structural changes should be imposed, especially since the state was
                    now the principal financial support of the school. It was felt that the university'S
                    accounting system should conform to the procedures recommended by the Indiana State Board of
                    Accounts, and the legislators were further of the opinion that the unwieldy 24-member university
                    board should be reduced in size so that it would be comparable to boards of the other
                    state-supported institutions of higher learning. These views were consistent with the
                    recommendations that had been made to the <placeName>

                    director of administrative services of the school. Stryzinski'S familiarity with the
                    legislative process was of great help in developing the program that was finally adopted.</p>

            <p>During the first decades of the twentieth century Americans of all classes came to terms with the
                    ways in which industrialization and urbanization affected their lives. The diversity of experience
                    was reflected in the dissimilarity of progressive reformers. Women approached reform from the
                    vantage point of family experiences and values and based their actions in the private and public
                    spheres on those values. Whatever their background, many American women responded strongly to the
                    urgent needs of the poor and the progressive temperament of their time, commiting themselves to
                    social work and reform within their communities.</p>
            <p>One of the vehicles used by American women to achieve their goals was the woman'S club.
                    Initially, middle-class white women, who were confined to the home after marriage, found that
                    participation in club life afforded them the opportunity to grow intellectually and socially. As
                    they became more aware of the problems and issues in American life, however, clubwomen began to
                    embrace an ideology that would permit them to move out into the public sphere of
                    activity—"Municipal Housekeeping." Implicit in organization was a
                    responsibility to benefit their communities as well as their families. The woman'S club

                    people to seek treatment from a woman doctor. By 1905 she was the principal of Public School 40 and

                    Woman'S Improvement Club members were predominantly professional women, primarily teachers

                    professional men, while others worked as cooks, seamstresses, cateresses, and domestic servants.
                    Some of the women could trace their family roots to the 1870s and 1880s. Others were married to

                    committees and several appointive ones for each project that the club undertook. Because the size of
                    the club was so small, each woman had the opportunity to serve on a committee—in fact,
                    was depended upon to do so—and at some point most WIC members held office. Consequently,
                    although there were several women who stood out as strong personalities and leaders, all club
                    members developed and exhibited organizational competence and ingenuity.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                    "cultured" woman. Her exceptional communication skills facilitated her contacts
                    within the white community, and she clearly used them to further the agenda of the WIC. Other WIC
                    women were definitely educated beyond the high school level. Ada Harris, schoolteacher and organizer

            <p>WIC members, like other black and white clubwomen, believed firmly in middle-class values and the
                    middle-class way of life. In addition, she, like other blacks and unlike many of her white
                    counterparts, had firsthand experience with the increased violence and racism occasioned by
                    industrialization and urbanization. This knowledge caused her to see unity, self-help, and group
                    consciousness as effective strategies for survival. In December, 1895, Fox traveled to

            <p>It was impossible for black clubwomen to separate their concerns as women from their concerns as
                    black people. They were not, however, aloof to women'S issues. That WIC members were well
                    aware of their special qualities and responsibilities as women is suggested by the topics that they
                    chose to study in their literary work: "Womanhood"; "Woman'S
                    Rights and Especially of the Importance of Negro Women Being Alive to their Opportunities";
                    "The White Slave Traffic"; "All Children Are Exceptional and It Is This
                    Varying Personality That Makes the Life an An Educator So Fascinating and So Perplexing";

                    the WIC, too, supported woman'S suffrage. In the summer of 1917, after meeting the
                    prerequisites for becoming a notary public, Harris held the first registration party for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>At the turn of the century black clubwomen generally subscribed to black nationalistic values of
                    uplift, self-help, and institutional separatism. WIC members recognized that the black
                    woman'S own survival and progress were closely tied to the survival and progress of her
                    race. Some of the topics that WIC women chose to study in their literary work indicate their sense
                    of racial pride and solidarity: the biographies of Martin R. Delany, Benjamin Banneker, Sojourner
                    Truth, Alexander Crummell, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Eliza P. McCoy, and Henry Ossawa Tanner, as well as

            <p>Black clubwomen, however, were interested in more than self-education. Community education, too, was
                    an important part of the "uplift" agenda. In addition to health and hygiene
                    information programs, the Woman'S Improvement Club sponsored lectures by prominent blacks
                    from other parts of the country. Visiting speakers included Mary Church Terrell, first president of
                    the National Association of Colored Women'S Clubs; Kelly Miller, professor at Howard
                    University; Ida Wells Barnett, black newspaperwoman and anti-lynching crusader; and W.E.B. DuBois,
                    the editor of <hi rend="i">Crisis</hi> magazine for the National Association for the Advancement of
                    Colored People (NAACP). These activities attracted the attendance of blacks and whites, including
                    May Wright Sewall, prominent white Indianaplis clubwoman and founder of the National and
                    International Councils of Women.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>Although black clubwomen endorsed the values of black nationalism, they clearly considered themselves
                    native American citizens. During World War I, WIC members worked along with other Americans to help
                    the allied cause. They collected pledges and money for the War Chest Board as well as for the
                    National Colored Soldiers Relief Committee, the Colored Soldiers Comfort Home, and the orphaned
                    children of black soldiers in <placeName>

            <p>The prevalence of disease and unsanitary conditions, especially in the urban areas, were issues of
                    primary concern to most Americans during the Progressive Era. Poor housing and health conditions in
                    the black community in particular compelled the Woman'S Improvement Club to focus on the
                    fight against tuberculosis. At the turn of the century an estimated five thousand Hoosiers died of
                    the disease each year, and during this period physicians and community organizations across the
                    country mobilized in the campaign against it. In 1900 the Indiana State Board of Health published

                    about good health habits. The society was also instrumental in opening a fresh air school for white
                    tuberculous students and in securing passage of legislation that made the tuberculin testing of
                    cattle and the recording of tuberculosis cases mandatory. By 1917 the tuberculosis society had

                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>. In that year the extension of separate preventive services to blacks through the
                    opening of the Flanner House Free Tuberculosis Clinic was prompted by a concern for the white
                    community'S own survival. In July, 1919, Dr. Alfred Henry, head of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> Tuberculosis Society, wrote to Mayor Charles W. Jewett requesting support for larger
                    appropriations to fight tuberculosis. In his letter, Henry noted that of approximately 30,000 blacks
                    living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> 134 died of tuberculosis in the first seven months of 1919. Furthermore there were at
                    least ten times that number of living cases. Calculating that each infected black had contact with
                    two to ten other people, Henry feared that conditions within the black community had reached the
                    point of "menacing the good health of the [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>] community in general." Although statewide the incidence of
                    tuberculosis-related deaths had declined from 174.1 per 100,000 population in 1909 to 110.9 in
                        1919,<hi rend="sup">24</hi> the death rate for black Hoosiers was always proportionately higher

                    attributed a similar difference to a tendency on the part of black Hoosiers to "not observe

                    ignored the fact that Hoosiers in general objected to sanitary regulations as late as 1906, in part
                    because they were skeptical of the curability of tuberculosis. More importantly, the State Board of
                    Health clearly did not consider poor housing conditions, overcrowding, and inadequate nutrition to
                    be vital factors in the high incidence of tuberculosis among black Hoosiers.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

                    of about 60 percent. The situation was made doubly dangerous by the fact that there was no place in
                    the city where black tuberculous patients could receive proper care. In the summer of 1919 Dr.

            <p>Within two years of its founding as a literary club in 1903, the Woman'S Improvement Club
                    had broadened its stated goal of self-improvement and instruction of its members to embrace
                    community assistance and improvement. In 1905 Flanner Guild, a settlement house in the black
                    community sponsored by white <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> mortician Frank W. Flanner, publicly announced a plan to provide care for black
                    tuberculous patients. The WIC quickly moved to take over and execute this project. Under the
                    leadership of Ida Webb Bryant, the daughter of a prominent nineteenth century black clubwoman, the
                    club—in August, 1905—secured the permission of William Haueisen, a white <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> businessman, to set up an outdoor tuberculosis camp on his Oak Hill property.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> That same summer the WIC paid for six "frail" black
                    children—those children who were anemic and underweight and thus susceptible to
                    tuberculosis—to be sent to the country for "strengthening" against the
                    disease. Club members also formed a nurses' training class for blacks, taught by the head
                    nurse from City Hospital. This class was of particular value to the black community since young
                    black women did not have access to the nursing schools at any of the city hospitals. Denied
                    admission to local nurses' training schools, they were forced to leave the state to attend
                    programs such as those at the Colored Hospital in <placeName>

            <p>The Oak Hill Camp, purportedly the first outdoor tuberculosis camp in the entire country,
                    "was situated on a hill surrounded by grand old oak trees with a tiny stream flowing at the
                    base of the hill." Initially WIC members had a problem in persuading their patients to
                    accept the idea of allowing "nature to heal them," but by 1909 the women were
                    looking for a way to expand the size of the camp. Oak Hill Camp, in operation during the summer
                    months only, consisted of three tents on raised wooden platforms and a portable cottage with a
                    partition down the middle. One side of the building was used as living quarters for the camp matron,

                    Schonaker, donated building materials. The Charity Organization Society, a white philanthropic
                    society, acted as liaison for donations from the greater <placeName>

                    individuals, churches, and businessmen. These fundraising ventures provided money for supplies,
                    groceries, and nursing care.</p>
            <p>WIC members frequently contributed to the camp themselves, usually contributing items necessary to
                    camp upkeep, such as a clothesline and clothespins, washboard, and blueing. Additionally, WIC women
                    themselves were occasionally inpatients and upon release, as was the case with Rose Hummons in 1909,
                    donated money to the camp in appreciation for care received. More often, however, the WIC solicited
                    money or materials from both the black and white communities. Black churches, such as Bethel A.M.E.,
                    Allen Chapel, and Ninth Presbyterian, collected money for the WIC and provided accommodations for
                    lectures and entertainments. In 1910 the Charity Organization Society pledged a weekly donation, and
                    Lillian Thomas Fox convinced Gertrude Oakes, of the City Dispensary, to donate five dollars a week
                    until fifty dollars was received to benefit the camp. That same year Daisy Brabham, another WIC
                    member, persuaded the manager of the Nickel Theatre to donate one day'S proceeds to the
                    camp, and the grocer from whom the WIC regularly bought supplies donated five dollars to their

                    Woman'S Improvement Club was organized, Harris founded a boys' club, for which by
                    1905 she had raised sufficient funds to purchase property and a building that contained a gymnasium,
                    reading room, and baths.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Beulah Wright Porter was not only one of the founding

                    wore many organizational hats. In addition to being an organizing vice-president of Bethel Christian

            <p>Even with the support of the black community, funding for the operation of Oak Hill was always tight,
                    and the Woman'S Improvement Club was often forced to close the camp earlier than planned.
                    The women, however, did not allow money shortages to discourage them. If necessary, and when they
                    had it, they personally provided funds to keep projects going. Thus, in 1909, the club not only
                    considered building an additional cottage on the campgrounds but also wanted to erect a cottage on

                    to get his permission to build on Oak Hill, but he was traveling abroad for his health. His son
                    refused to grant permission in his father'S absence and further suggested the
                    inadvisability of building on property that they did not own. He did propose that if the WIC bought
                    one or more lots at Oak Hill his father would probably give the club another one. This proposal,
                    however, was not followed up since the son was not authorized to speak for his father.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>Although in 1909 the Woman'S Improvement Club did not have the money in hand to build a
                    cottage on City Hospital grounds, in 1911 Fox met with Dr. Freedland, the superintendent of City
                    Hospital, to discuss the club'S proposed plans. He refused their request to build, stating
                    that there were cottages not in use already erected at <placeName>

                    </placeName> City Hospital. No consideration appears to have been given, however, to allowing black
                    patients to use the "unoccupied" cottages.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the WIC members became more experienced and more confident of their ability, they increased their

                    </placeName> area. Although the Woman'S Improvement Club had earlier solicited support for
                    its work outside the black community, club minute ledgers first mention extracommunity ties in
                    April, 1911. At that time clubwomen met with three nurses from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
                    to discuss a plan by which the company might assist in the reopening of the Oak Hill Camp.
                    Metropolitan had a program in which nurses accompanied its agents on weekly collection visits to
                    clients' homes. Those visits enabled Metropolitan'S nurses to keep track of
                    illnesses and refer patients to proper facilities or a doctor for care. In the case of blacks the
                    club'S contact with the Metropolitan nursing program established a system of referrals to
                    the Oak Hill Camp.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> In June, 1911, concerned with expanding its contacts with
                    other agencies and hoping to generate interest in its work, the Woman'S Improvement Club
                    held a public meeting at the Colored YMCA. The club allocated funds to advertise the meeting and
                    sent letters of invitation to physicians and ministers in the community. Mary Arnold Meyers,

                    own operation, for the only mentioned improvement that they made to the Oak Hill Camp after this
                    visit was the addition of a visitor'S book to record the many visitors to Oak Hill.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Woman'S Improvement Club closed its camp permanently in 1916. Population growth and the
                    proximity of new homes have been cited as factors that convinced the women to take this action.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Those factors might indeed have had some influence on the women'S
                    decision, but the continuing lack of funds and loss or misplacement of equipment in combination with
                    a general trend away from institutionalization as the only method of caring for the tuberculous
                    might have had a more direct bearing on their decision. By the second decade of the twentieth
                    century Hoosier medical journals indicate an acceptance of home care methods in tuberculosis
                    treatment and a move away from the view of institutionalized treatment as the ideal. The cost of
                    treatment, both in dollars and time away from the family, would have made home treatment the more
                    functional and appealing approach for black patients. Statistics indicate that the majority of
                    tuberculous patients, black and white, were women who had to find alternative care for their
                    families when they were institutionalized. Even when her children were cared for by white-organized
                    child care groups, the mother had to worry about meeting the expenses incurred by her children in
                    addition to her own expenses.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once the operation of Oak Hill Camp was discontinued, WIC members turned to home nursing, social
                    work, and educational programs, which could be carried out on a year-round basis. Between 1916 and
                    1918 the Woman'S Improvement Club sponsored lectures to educate the community about
                    tuberculosis and other health matters in order to raise money for their work. They had the support
                    of several black ministers, who allowed them to use church facilities for slide shows and lectures.
                    Mary A. Meyers was a frequent speaker at club meetings and WIC-sponsored community assemblies. She
                    and the WIC women had a supportive relationship. <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>, made a joint appeal to Flower Mission Hospital to accept black patients. Although the
                    hospital agreed to admit a few black patients, it later reneged and continued its policy of
                    discrimination. This hospital policy was in keeping with an established notion that the black
                    community—with some assistance from whites—would assume the responsibility for
                    its own charity work, even though "charity work" for blacks usually meant
                    providing the same basic services furnished to the white community by the state and city
                        governments.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Also in November, 1916, the WIC took part in the opening of

                    raise funds for the school. The most successful of those events was a children'S Christmas
                    party that they held at Tomlinson Hall. Entry was free of charge, and the only profit that the club
                    made was from the sale of refreshments. Despite a bad snowstorm children from schools 23, 24, 26,

                    newspapers and interviewed several candidates for the position, including Lillian Kakaza, the black
                    woman eventually hired as the nurse for the Flanner House Tuberculosis Clinic.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
                    By the end of February, 1918, the clubwomen decided to hire one of their own members because they
                    felt that she would be more interested in their work than an outsider. In April, 1918, Daisy
                    Brabham, wife of the Reverend George R. Brabham of Ninth Presbyterian Church and a WIC member since
                    1910, began work at a salary of thirty-five dollars per month. The decision to select an insider may
                    have hinged upon the club'S previous bad experience with a camp nurse who left without
                    notice, possibly because the WIC was often behind in payment of her salary. With Brabham the group
                    could count on a nurse willing to work without pay when there were no funds, so this was apparently
                    a wise decision.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite being constantly strapped for money to operate, the Woman'S Improvement Club
                    continually pushed for expanded services. In 1918 the WIC approached the Flanner Guild in an
                    unsuccessful attempt to get that organization to open a tuberculosis clinic. The women did, however,
                    set up a working arrangement with Flanner Guild, in which guild social service experts advised them
                    on "how to put [their] own assistant to work in a business[like] manner."
                    Unfortunately, the WIC minutes ledgers do not go into detail as to exactly what that arrangement
                        entailed.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, in 1918, the WIC'S pressure within the white community had tangible results. In
                    February a WIC committee sent to negotiate with Flower Mission Hospital managed to get permission to
                    furnish a room for black patients. In April the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi> offered to publicize the club'S work in its columns, an unusual step
                    since this was not the paper'S usual fare. In May the WIC members sent a letter to the
                    State Board of Health successfully requesting that their social worker be given the power of a
                    health official. In June they received a letter commending their work from the <placeName>

                    also funded local charities and the Red Cross. Endorsement by the War Chest meant that the
                    Woman'S Improvement Club was eligible to apply for assistance from the organization, and
                    this the women promptly did. In 1919 the War Chest awarded the WIC five hundred dollars to finance

            <p>The State Board of Health'S endorsement of the WIC'S work further heightened the

                    Brabham and the WIC supplied Henry with the figures for the number of cases of tuberculosis in the
                    black community. These figures were probably unusually accurate because, in addition to acting as
                    the club'S contact with the newspapers, the board of health, and Flanner House, Brabham
                    accompanied any physician in charge of patients on his home visits in the black community and
                    provided follow-up care to those patients. She also worked closely with Kakaza, the nurse/social
                    worker in the new Flanner House Tuberculosis Clinic, which was opened in February of 1919 and
                    jointly managed by Flanner House and the tuberculosis society.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In November, 1919, the WIC signed a petition and delivered it to the county commissioners asking that
                    additional funds be appropriated to Sunnyside Sanatorium to provide care for incurable black
                    patients. That year Sunnyside provided eight beds for use by blacks and treated a total of fifteen
                    patients. The total number of black patients is low because they averaged a longer residence at the
                    institution than white patients and so were discharged in smaller proportion than whites. The length
                    of their stay in the sanatorium was probably related to two factors. First, wage earning and child
                    care responsibilities deterred most blacks from seeking treatment until they were seriously or
                    incurably ill. Second, home conditions, where blacks were forced to live in the same room and often
                    to sleep in the same bed as tuberculous patients, were not conducive to a restful cure. The WIC
                    publicized its request for more beds for black patients in the newspapers. The club'S plea
                    resulted in plans for an addition of fifty beds for blacks at the sanatorium. In 1919 only eight
                    beds were allotted to blacks, and fifteen black patients were treated that year.
                    Sunnyside'S annual reports up to 1926 do not show any increase in the number of beds to
                    fifty. In fact, the reports indicate that the institution continued to allocate beds to <list type="footnotes">

                    could go for extended care. In 1922 the next generation of Woman'S Improvement Club
                    members, who were younger, professional women, responded to the need for such facilities. Launching
                    a direct attack on the problem, they took over the abandoned Sisters of Charity Hospital on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> Street. There they provided care for black advanced tuberculous patients until 1924
                    when, with the assistance of Dr. Henry and the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> Tuberculosis Society, they managed to purchase a cottage large enough for six patients.
                    Eventually they convinced the Community Fund of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to finance the employment of a trained nurse at the Agnes Street Cottage. Until 1938
                    approximately thirty-five patients a year found treatment at the cottage. In that year the Flower
                    Mission provided a segregated ward in its new hospital on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> Boulevard. Throughout the 1920s Woman'S Improvement Club expanded its social
                    service activities. The women secured funds for undernourished black children to spend summers in
                    the country and financially assisted poor blacks threatened with eviction. At the same time they
                    continued to provide milk and eggs to those ill at home with tuberculsis.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

            <p>WIC clubwomen'S activities were in step with those of American women nationwide, as they
                    entered the mainstream of public affairs. The history of the Woman'S Improvement Club
                    reflects the goals of black clubwomen nationally at the turn of the century. The club offered its
                    members an opportunity for further education, which was increasingly denied them by white society,
                    and for selfexpression. Concerned not only with self-improvement but also with racial survival and
                    uplift, WIC women, like black women across the nation, made community welfare a primary part of the
                    club'S agenda. The Woman'S Improvement Club story is also part of the history of
                    social welfare trends and reflects the change from the use of volunteers only to the use of
                    volunteers <hi rend="i">and</hi> a well-trained staff. As educated women, club members approached
                    tuberculosis work in the new professional and scientific manner that prevailed during the
                    Progressive Era. In August, 1918, the club even undertook the study of Johns Hopkins University
                    texts on "The Negroe'S Tendency to Tuberculosis." The initiative of WIC
                    women in charity work exemplifies the changes in philosophy from "handouts" to
                    "scientific preventive work," and changes in methods of financing assistance to
                    the indigent.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the best of their abilities members of the Woman'S Improvement Club provided an important
                    social service to their community. This service eventually caused them to venture out into the

            <p>Carlos McCarty (1873-1934) wrote about national and state events and local history for the Loogootee,
                    Indiana, <hi rend="i">Martin County Tribune</hi> for nearly thirty-five years. As the
                    newspaper'S only local columnist during the first three decades of the twentieth century,
                    McCarty, a lawyer by profession, probably did more to shape public opinion in Martin County than any
                    other resident. In 1930 when he was elected prosecuting attorney for Martin County, he received one
                    of the largest popular votes in the county'S history,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> a fact perhaps
                    in part attributable to his popularity with the readers of the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>.</p>
            <p>McCarty'S column, some years titled with deceptive simplicity "Crisp Bits of News
                    from the County Seat," avoided the controversial issues of the day. His readers encountered
                    few of the sordid scandals, film and radio personalities, or political conflicts that dominated
                    national and state news. Possibly painful local controversies were also apparently deliberately
                    avoided. Ku Klux Klan activities, for example, passed without comment although the KKK parade in
                    Loogootee in the spring of 1924 attracted one of the largest crowds in the town'S
                        history.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> McCarty also tended to ignore local labor problems and local
                    opinion on prohibition. It is further revealing that while he did write about the lynching of a
                    notorious group of local criminals in Shoals in 1886, he apparently thought <list type="footnotes">

                    column, thus providing insight into his and his contemporaries' views on economic issues in
                    southwestern Indiana between World Wars I and II.</p>
            <p>A recurrent economic theme in McCarty'S <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> column was his promotion
                    among his readers of what Alexis de Tocqueville defined in 1835 as the American "spirit of
                    commerce." Typical American traits, according to the Frenchman, were a preference for
                    commercial occupations and an idealization of entrepreneurship; Americans, he said, were restless,
                    strove for personal success, and were exceptionally willing to take risks.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    Whether or not McCarty consciously ascribed the definition of such values to Tocqueville, the
                    southern Indiana lawyer believed in them, considered them synonymous with modernization, and thought
                    them essential to the general good of the community. In McCarty'S opinion, however, the
                    residents of Martin County adhered more closely to what the sociologist Max Weber later called
                    "economic traditionalism."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Rather than striving for progress
                    and greater affluence, they seemed to McCarty content to make only enough money to sustain a
                    relatively low standard of living. It was in this context that McCarty promoted the spirit of
                    commerce.</p>
            <p>Despite McCarty'S frequent criticism of his Martin County neighbors' economic
                    indolence, his own stance regarding modernization was inconsistent. A constant advocate of economic
                    "progress," McCarty nonetheless felt a strong attachment to traditional rural
                    virtues. Although his columns were rarely explicitly nostalgic, particularly during the early 1920s,
                    they often extolled pioneer craftsmanship and self-sufficiency. More often the articles promoted
                    economic development and modern initiative. At the local level McCarty'S role models were
                    John Anthony, a man who had experimented in human flight in the 1870s and 1880s, and the founders of
                    the frontier community called Hindostan. In both cases, however, McCarty exaggerated the degree to
                    which these people were committed to the spirit of commerce. The social disorder caused by the Great
                    Depression of course challenged McCarty'S belief in this spirit. Unfortunately, the
                    lawyer'S death in 1934 denied his readers anything more than his initial reactions to the
                    economic conflict.</p>

                        not explicitly economic but that has consequences for the economy. McCarty'S repeated
                        effort to boost local pride is an example.</item>

            <p>McCarty'S background provides the setting for the evolution of many of his economic
                    opinions. The McCarty family came to America early; in fact, Carlos knew of only one ancestor who
                    had immigrated to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> after the Revolutionary War.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Both his mother'S and
                    father'S families were pioneer settlers in Martin County, Indiana. During the Civil War
                    Carlos'S father, Charles (1830-1895), served as a captain in Company A of the 17th Indiana
                    Volunteer Infantry. Charles remarried after his first wife died in 1870 at the age of thirty-three,
                    and Carlos was born to the second wife, Margaret Ford (1839-1908). Charles Thomas McCarty, or Carlos
                    as he preferred to call himself after a local Spanish street vendor, was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on April 6, 1873. When he was about seven years old, his parents returned to
                    Martin County, and his father practiced law in Shoals. Carlos spent nearly all his adult life there.</p>
            <p>McCarty was a member of the second class to graduate from Shoals High School. Because of the small
                    population of the town there were only enough students to form a second class several years after
                    the first class had graduated. During this interval McCarty attended the Southern Indiana Normal
                    College at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Typical of his personal reticence in "Crisp Bits of News from the County
                    Seat," McCarty rarely mentioned his own education. Since he did have a high school diploma,
                    one can infer that he was better educated than the majority of his readers. His literary background,
                    however, was apparently very conventional and did not extend much beyond a knowledge of the
                    better-known nineteenth century English and American authors. At various times McCarty referred to
                    the books of Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and Rudyard
                    Kipling. Samuel Pepys was one of the rare seventeenth century writers whom he mentioned in his
                    columns. Nothing, however, would lead a reader to believe that McCarty had more than a cursory
                    understanding of any of these authors. The lawyer/journalist was also knowledgeable about the more
                    popular mass publications of his day: <placeName>

                    and, following in his father'S footsteps, became a lawyer. He acquired the knowledge to
                    pass the bar examination by apprenticing with his father. McCarty continued his journalistic
                    activities more as a hobby than as a source of support. According to his daughter, Margaret Force,
                    he earned three dollars per article—and a free newspaper.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> An added
                    incentive would have been the constant newspaper exposure that was undoubtedly beneficial to his
                    legal practice.</p>

                    </placeName>, one can surmise that McCarty was uninformed or ill-informed about the practical
                    realities of business, above all those at the corporate level. Certainly, his legal practice would
                    not have brought him into contact with clients from big business. The decade of the 1920s, however,
                    was an era in which large corporations rapidly expanded; McCarty, who may not even have realized it,
                    probably grew increasingly out of touch with contemporary economic conditions.</p>

                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi> The first surviving issue of the <hi rend="i">Martin County
                            Tribune</hi> that lists McCarty as Shoals correspondent was published June 5, 1891. At that
                            time, however, he was simply compiling a list of local happenings, not writing articles.
                            McCarty apparently held this position until 1894, August 18 of that year being the last
                            extant issue in which he is listed as correspondent. Then in 1900 McCarty assumed his
                            position as correspondent once again, and his column reappears as early as January 26, 1900.
                            The column at that time took the form that it had throughout the 1920s and 1930s. It
                            consisted of both a list of events and an article on a topic of McCarty'S choice.
                            Because the <hi rend="i">Martin County Tribune</hi> was not preserved prior to the opening
                            of the Shoals Public Library, few of his articles published before 1917 seem to have
                            survived. The column was frequently reprinted, however, and a search through other southern
                            Indiana newspapers might uncover articles appearing before World War I.</item>

                    a journalist trying to shape public opinion, that McCarty intended to influence his
                    readers' beliefs is obvious, most notably whenever he mentions the distorted image of rural
                    southern Indiana found in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers. According to McCarty, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> journalists thought that people who lived in the hills of southern Indiana were
                    simpletons. "Up there people do not think we are far removed from the lowest type of
                        southerners."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> McCarty believed that such biased views produced
                    feelings of superiority in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the expense of southern counties, and he took it upon himself to counteract this
                    negative image, going so far as to claim that the authentic Hoosier traditions could be found only
                    in the southern part of the state. He further declared that he feared the time when all of northern
                    Indiana would be culturally integrated with <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>For most of his life McCarty'S political sympathies were Republican, and in the early years
                    between World Wars I and II he sometimes used his column to advance the Republican cause in a
                    straight-forward manner: "The worst that can be said of the Republican administration is
                    that it has not kept Main street clean or kept the globes on the lamp-posts on Main street clean.
                    Rather a small matter … ."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> After the mid-1920s, however,
                    his writing became less strident. Although McCarty harshly criticized Wood-row Wilson during the
                    presidential campaign of 1920, he allowed the decisive election of 1932 to pass with little comment.
                    In the 1924 election he counseled voters not to undermine the two-party system by choosing
                    "self-seeking political parasites" who represented third parties. McCarty feared
                    that, because of their political naïveté, women (as well as men voting for the
                    first time) were especially likely to pick third-party candidates such as Robert La Follette, who
                    was running for the presidency on the Progressive party ticket.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> In 1919
                    McCarty equated Bolshevism with anarchy, calling it an "ulcer." It had, he said,
                    the "destructiveness of a lightning bolt," but he believed it to be an expected
                    aftermath of war and unrealistically strict enforcement of the law. His criticism was more tempered
                    than one might expect.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a local politician McCarty was quite pragmatic. Campaigning for office for the first time in 1930,
                    he chose to switch his party affiliation and run as a Democrat. He did not justify his behavior in
                    print, but his reasons are self-evident. Not only had the handling of the economy in <placeName>

                    in disarray. Martin County Democrats won by a landslide in 1930. Changing parties must have placed
                    McCarty in an awkward position during the national election of 1932 because his reaction to the
                    Depression did not suggest that he would have wholeheartedly supported <placeName>

                    campaigned unsuccessfully in 1934 for the office of judge in the 49th judicial circuit, which
                    contains Martin and <placeName>

                    </placeName> turned out to be a disadvantage for the politician/journalist from Martin County.
                    McCarty died in November, 1934, only a few months after his wife. An obituary mentioned overwork as
                    a contributing cause of his death.</p>
            <p>From McCarty'S comments in his columns it is clear that he thought only a person'S
                    public activities should concern readers. It thus should not be surprising that, despite the
                    duration of his weekly column, little is known about McCarty'S private life. McCarty
                    appears to have been the quintessential village lawyer of the early twentieth century except,
                    possibly, for his long commitment to journalism. He was moderately successful in his profession;
                    active in volunteer associations and the Methodist church; and, so far as one can determine, a model
                    spouse. Family photographs show him to have been an attractice and robust young man with slightly
                    wavy dark hair.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>McCarty'S values seem to have been established during the years preceding World War I, and
                    he apparently did not doubt their continued relevance for the 1920s. Too old to fight in the war, he
                    neither experienced nor wrote about the disillusionment that the conflict produced in many younger
                    Americans. The "roaring '20s" were not for McCarty a "jazz
                    age." The world he presented was an austere one of constant work and simple pleasures; in
                    that respect it is a world view similar to the one described in Robert and Helen Lynd'S <placeName>

            <p>In November, 1918, anticipating the end of World War I, McCarty noted that a conclusion to the
                    hostilities would not mean an end to competition and strife. Social life was inevitably
                    characterized by conflict, he believed. All that would change would be the way in which conflict was
                    expressed. It would be less violent and channeled into economic activities. Thus he urged readers to
                    organize business associations in order to give their hometowns a competitive advantage. The
                    military metaphors he used to describe the economy were not meant to be critical but

                    McCarty'S cas-tigation of rural indolence, a theme that continually appeared in his
                    writings. While he celebrated Shoals'S slow-paced character, he could also be harshly
                    critical of the town, revealing at the same time an antipathy toward the American South: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>For McCarty there were two categories of people: the "boosters" of economic
                    progress, the group to which he admittedly belonged; and "the pessimists, jeremiahs, and
                    knockers," whom he scorned.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Certainly in his opinion there were too
                    many of the latter in Martin County. "Muzzle your knockers," he urged.
                    "Don't let your drones and non-progressive citizens ride you to death. Let the
                    modern, progressive and up-to-date spirit prevail in everything ...."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>McCarty thought in 1928 that the industrial development of Martin County was lagging behind that of
                        agriculture.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> During the last third of the nineteenth century the major
                    industry in Shoals had been the manufacture of timber products, particularly the making of barrels.
                    Although technological change did play some part in the decline of this industry (metal hoops
                    replaced the wooden ones that were handmade in Shoals), the dwindling number of harvestable trees
                    was the primary factor. In the early twentieth century the making of pearl buttons from mussel
                    shells became the major business in Shoals. McCarty regretfully pointed out that neither industry
                    required complex technology. Shoals factories specialized in the simpler wood products, and only the
                    initial stage of making buttons was done locally. They were then shipped west for final
                        processing.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Following the 1920 census, which showed the population of Shoals to be stagnating, McCarty worriedly
                    speculated about the reasons for this dormancy. After reviewing what he considered to be the bright
                    economic potential of the county, he concluded that the real cause of stagnation could only be the
                    "lethargy and indolence of our people."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> (Social scientists

                    adherence to free enterprise and his belief that Martin County was rich in undiscovered natural
                    resources, few other rational explanations were available to him. Every year McCarty wrote articles
                    in which he sought to inspire the spirit of commerce among readers. For instance, in an article
                    titled "Ice Cream and Opportunity," he pointed out that even something as prosaic
                    as ice cream could be highly profitable if people just took the initiative to develop new
                        products.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Suggestions for improving local communities abound in
                    McCarty'S column: more modern utilities, more civic pride, better quality newspapers,
                    merchants displaying their wares more imaginatively, more entertainment for the young in order to
                    keep "people who are wide awake and reaching out for better things."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The reasonableness and practicality of many of his suggestions probably accentuated the
                    dissatisfaction he felt over his ineffectiveness. Shoals hardly progressed beyond the stage of a
                    one-street business district.</p>
            <p>McCarty'S favorite solution to Martin County'S lagging economy was the development
                    of its tourist potential, either on a free-enterprise basis or with state help in the form of a
                    state park. A park to rival Spring Mill, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName> in Lawrence County, or <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, could feasibly have been established near Shoals, which was just as scenically
                    situated in southern Indiana. Once other localities took the initiative in opening recreational
                    areas, however, there were not many attractions that Martin County could offer to distinguish it
                    from the rest of the state. Without something unique tourists would have little incentive to visit
                    Shoals. McCarty was adamantly opposed to the state'S purchasing economically marginal
                    farmland for forest reserves because, he assumed, this would result in the loss of tax revenue. He
                    called such solutions "chimerical suggestions, unreasonable, half-baked ideas."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> He died before the proposed reserves became a reality in Martin County. While
                    he occasionally wrote about tourism in a very crass manner ("Wake up and get your fingers
                    in these tourist pocket books."), he was sincerely concerned about the absence of a viable
                    economic base for the county.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Writing during the years between the two world wars, McCarty could draw upon a broad spectrum of
                    knowledge for his columns. The range of experiences available to him as topics helps to explain his
                    reaction to contemporary events. In the 1920s McCarty still had the opportunity to talk to people
                    with pioneer experience, not the first generation Hoosier pioneers perhaps but those who <list type="footnotes">

                    under primitive conditions. An article appearing in 1932, for example, commemorated the ninety-third
                    birthday of "Uncle" Levi Wildman (1839-1945). At about the age of six months
                    "Uncle" Levi had come with his parents from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to Indiana. As a boy on his way home from school, he had encountered a bear, and he had
                    accompanied the men who had hauled stone to build the jail in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dover</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hill when it was the county seat in the 1840s. McCarty reported on Wildman'S
                    account of the construction of the road between the towns of Mount Pleasant and Trinity Springs. The
                    road had, he said, followed in places a line of timber uprooted by a tornado.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the other extreme McCarty discussed the building of a network of hard-surface roads in Martin
                    County and throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Indeed, in the 1920s, he wrote about few topics as often as the impact of the
                    automobile on everyday life. McCarty celebrated such new institutions as the gasoline station,
                    writing in an article entitled "Truly American" that its development read
                    "almost like a romance."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> On another occasion he commented
                    with admiration about the "snappy appearing filling stations."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> He continued to claim that "after all change in America always means
                        improvement",<hi rend="sup">35</hi> yet, he related that the two livery barns in town
                    destroyed by a windstorm had earlier been centers for loafing and playing poker, and he never
                    expected gasoline stations to fill that function.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obviously McCarty thought of himself as a staunch supporter of progress; nonetheless, he remained
                    very attached to the past. That his weekly column so often featured articles on local history
                    implies a nostalgic outlook. Furthermore, he idealized Hoosier pioneers. He believed that they were
                    more artistic than their descendants and that they had created "honest, hand made home
                    made" objects while the succeeding generations preferred "bright
                        babbles."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> He liked the coarse texture of cornmeal and buckwheat
                    flour ground in the nineteenth century manner on stone buhrs. He also preferred old-fashioned
                    handmade kites to the new factory-made ones. "Today the boys go to the nearest store and
                    depositing a few nickels, are handed a rolled-up paper affair that has about as much resemblance to
                    an old time kite, as a water dog [salamander], caught about the same time in our streams, has to a

            </p>
            <p>It must not be forgotten that McCarty wrote for an audience in one of the least prosperous sections
                    of the state. By 1934 little industrial development had taken place in Martin County, and the
                    younger, better educated citizens of the county were moving away. In terms of formal education
                    Martin County also lagged behind many areas of Indiana; in the 1930s it had more nonconsolidated,
                    one-room rural schools than any other Hoosier county.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> These factors greatly
                    limited what <hi rend="i">McCarty</hi> could do as a columnist. A successful journalist must be
                    attuned to his audience since he is writing for the present rather than the future. There are many
                    indications in McCarty'S writings that he desired to please his public (hence the
                    self-censorship) and thus produced articles combining his own beliefs with what he thought people
                    would like to read. One cannot assume, therefore, that his column was always a perfect reflection of
                    his own opinions. The form in which McCarty'S views appeared must also be considered. Short
                    weekly newspaper articles naturally fragment any author'S ideas, and since McCarty never
                    kept a scrapbook or collection of articles,<hi rend="sup">41</hi> "Crisp Bits of
                    News" may have contradictions hidden even from McCarty himself. Nor should one overlook the
                    fact that journalism did not provide his means of support. McCarty was often preoccupied by his
                    legal practice and had to write hurriedly. These factors alone, however, cannot account for his
                    vacillating reaction to modernization. Given the magnitude of the social changes that were occurring
                    and their ramifications on all aspects of everyday life, it is unlikely that anyone could have been
                    unequivocally consistent in support of "progress." McCarty of course recognized
                    the dramatic social changes that were affecting even Martin County, and his comments perhaps reveal
                    something about his reaction to them.</p>

            <p>Despite inconsistencies McCarty continued to believe in the efficacy of free enterprise and to
                    promote it in his column. To promote it effectively, however, he needed real people to personify its
                    values. The national figure that McCarty felt best exemplified the spirit of commerce was Henry
                    Ford. At the local level he looked to John Anthony and to the founders of Hindostan. It might be
                    noted that McCarty himself was committed to the hard work indicative of the spirit of commerce, but
                    little in his life suggests a willingness to take the personal risks he believed to be socially
                    desirable. When writing about his heroes of commerce, McCarty often did not know enough about an
                    event to reconstruct it with certainty. He thus picked from a variety of plausible motives and
                    explanations and in the process sometimes either distorted or simplified events as they are
                    understood today. McCarty'S articles are therefore more important because they reveal
                    something about the author himself than because they are factual, objective historical accounts.</p>
            <p>McCarty'S first hero, John Anthony (1802-1886), was born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. As a young man Anthony moved to New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, where he worked as a shoemaker. A few years after his marriage he moved his
                    family to the Martin County village of Mount Pleasant where he spent many years farming and where he
                    helped to organize one of the first county schools. Later, Anthony purchased a farm near Shoals and
                    gave part of his land for the building of a one-room schoolhouse. McCarty failed to report that in
                    the 1840s Anthony was fined for "vending spirits without a license."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Apparently Anthony made a total of three attempts at flying and "ended his [flying]
                    career" in 1886.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Historical records, unfortunately vague on the
                    technical nature of his flying machines, do at least document the fact that he did build them:
                    "He secured some cheese cloth and other materials and draped them about his arms and legs
                    and tried to fly from a tree, which he climbed to the very top. The attempt resulted in a fall and
                    some broken bones."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Probably McCarty never saw Anthony'S
                    flying machine(s), but he certainly had the opportunity to talk to many people who had been
                    acquainted with the erstwhile aviator; in fact, many were still alive <list type="footnotes">

                    never actually appeared at a fair held in Loogootee in the autumn of 1881, at which a public
                    demonstration of flying was to be one of the main attractions, because a few days before it opened
                    he was injured jumping from his barn roof during a trial run.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> A joke printed
                    in a county history is typical of the local humor recorded in McCarty'S column:
                    "While Anthony was recovering from the crash, it is said that a half-wit wanted to know
                    what caused the failure. When the injured man explained that he did not know, as he used his wings
                    exactly like the buzzards, the person meekly inquired, ‘Did you spread your
                        tail?'"<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From McCarty'S point of view Anthony was inspiring because of his idealism, his personal
                    initiative, and his willingness to take risks. McCarty'S ideas about the origin of
                    inventions were not unlike the views of the nineteenth century French sociologist Gabriel Tarde.
                    Generally ignoring the influence of broad social factors, both saw inventions as the work of
                    exceptional individuals; both feared <list type="footnotes">

                            Tribune</hi> is apparently no longer extant; it was, however, available in the 1950s when a
                            history of Martin County was being written. McCarty'S article prompted some readers
                            to give him additional technical information: "Wm. H. Batchelor lived a near
                            neighbor [to Anthony] and he says the machine was mounted on four wheels, the modern ones
                            mounted on two; and that it had a platform where Anthony was to sit during flights, and had
                            wings at each side and a tail, similar in principle like the Spirit of Saint Louis, which
                            was used by Lindbergh in his ocean flight. No motive power was provided by Anthony other
                            than such manipulations as he could make himself." Martin County Tribune, June 23,
                            1927. Batchelor'S comments were quoted in McCarty'S list of news items.
                            According to the Martin County death records, John Anthony died in Loogootee, Indiana, on
                            January 5, 1886, at the age of eighty-three years and four months. The cause of death is
                            listed as "congestion of the lungs," and he died "after an
                            illness of ten days." No mention is made of his work as a farmer. Instead, the
                            entry for occupation reads "worked at flying machine." It has not been
                            possible to discover the place of burial, but Anthony was possibly buried beside his wife in
                            an unmarked grave in St. John'S Cemetery in Loogootee. Death Records, IX, 52,

                            retold the story of John Anthony, quoting a letter from a woman who remembered him from her
                            childhood: "I was about ten years of age at the time and we school children had a
                            lot of fun with Mr. Anthony'S ‘Buzzard,’ as we loved to call
                            his machine, which was constructed of heavy cotton material. We worked hard helping him get
                            it started down the incline, which he built for that purpose, and it was grand riding on the
                            track. The efforts were not entirely in vain, for we got a great thrill helping him to make
                            it fly. Although very young at the time I remember distinctly that it flapped its wings four
                            times before crashing. I often heard Mr. Anthony say ‘Some day people will be
                            flying through the air like birds.‘" Quoted in Loogootee <hi rend="i">Tribune,</hi> November 29, 1951.</item>

                    less daring and less imaginative friends and neighbors.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Whether or not Anthony
                    actually had the traits that McCarty attributed to him is questionable. Anthony did indeed have the
                    courage to stand up to public ridicule, but since he lacked the most rudimentary scientific
                    sophistication, he emerged from the historical record more as a person engaged in a rather
                    irrational quest than a bona fide example of the spirit of commerce. That aspect of the story
                    McCarty downplayed, and he also did not appear to be concerned about the propriety of an
                    eighty-year-old man publicly engaging in dangerous stunts. Perhaps he did not know
                    Anthony'S exact age.</p>
            <p>The ideological elements in McCarty'S presentation of local history emerge more dramatically
                    in his writings on Hindostan. Founded about 1818 or 1819, Hindostan was abandoned in the mid-1820s.
                    Its promising future was cut short when a large number of its inhabitants were killed by a
                    "plague" of unknown origin. The remaining citizens left, and the town fell into
                    ruins. It is not known whether they all left at once or whether Hindostan gradually became a ghost
                    town. The former opinion predominates in folklore; the latter has appeared more plausible to some
                        historians.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to an 1826 gazetteer Hindostan contained "100 inhabitants, 2 stores, two taverns,
                    1 blacksmith, 1 cabinetmaker, one saddler, 1 wagon maker, 1 mill Wright, 2 shoemekers [sic], 2
                    tailors, and one carpenter."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Another source estimated that the
                    maximum population of the town was perhaps five hundred.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Plats of Hindostan
                    survive, but one cannot distinguish between what was planned and what was actually developed.
                    Several travelers noted their visits to the city, and a public speech given in Hindostan on July 4,
                    1821, was recently republished. McCarty would not have had access to the original oration, however,

            <p>Frontier people have often been presented in literature as outcasts, shady characters, or illiterate,
                    simple backwoodsmen. A recent example is Scott R. Sanders'S <hi rend="i">Wilderness
                    Plots,</hi> which consists of vignettes based upon real characters from the frontier period of the
                        <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> The frontier as a heroic experience is
                    also a major theme in Sanders'S writings, but he, unlike McCarty, balances this positive
                    message with a gallery of deviant characters: alcoholics, corrupt government officials, arsonists,
                    whites who behave more savagely than Indians. In McCarty'S interpretation, as stated in two
                    articles dated 1914 and 1929, the founders of frontier Hindostan were not only "bold
                    pioneers" but "well to do men, businessmen in the fullest sense." The man
                    McCarty called the "prime mover" in the corporation formed by the founders was a
                    tavern owner, Frederick Sholts. Although Sholts'S occupation might be interpreted by some
                    as reinforcing the negative stereotype of backwoodsmen, McCarty saw the tavern as "one of
                    the well known houses of entertainment which was established along the trail between <placeName>

            <p>McCarty described Hindostan as being "in the full vigor and growth of a lusty young frontier
                    town." For McCarty this phrase implied commerical activity, and he cited as youthful vigor
                    the "sophistication" of the mills and the business establishments. Also referring
                    to business, he wrote of the "general awakening that was occurring over the entire
                    frontier." McCarty'S search in local county records for information about
                    Hindostan'S founders reinforced his belief in the grassroots respectability of these men.
                    They were not, as he did not expect them to be, migrant gypsies who left no written trace. Further,
                    "Deed Record Number One" in the county records showed all of them to be
                    native-born American.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

                    another name, such as the "Proprietors of Black Creek" or the
                    "Proprietors of French Lick," the imagery would have been less grand. McCarty
                    wrote of "their dreams of a great city." The town'S name can indeed be
                    seen as fitting that description. In McCarty'S view these men were goal-directed; they came
                    together not by accident but with the explicit intention of laying out a new town. Considering the
                    poor communications of the era, he thought readers should be amazed that the group ever managed to
                    form. "When we look back a century and ten years ago, and consider how inadequate were
                    means of communication, how difficult it was to get people together who lived far apart we may well
                    wonder how this Hindostan company came to be organized."<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Martin County was organized in 1820, Hindostan became its county seat, and one of the activities
                    of the new county commissioners was establishing prices, specifically those for tavern keepers.
                    McCarty believed that the pioneers tolerated such government intervention in the economy only
                    because there were so few laws restricting their freedom, not because they were any less independent
                    than their descendants. "Think what an uproar would be the result if the commissioners of
                    Martin county at their next session should endeavor to regulate prices in this method. But our
                    forefathers were of sturdy stock. They did not have so much law to confront them as we now
                        have."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Once again, he insisted on the pioneers' natural
                    strength and goodness; they did not need laws to do what was right.</p>
            <p>The official end of Hindostan was symbolized by the county seat'S being moved to another
                    town. "The sun had set for Hindostan," McCarty wrote. He made an analogy between
                    the trials of the ancient Hebrews and the plight of Hindostan, saying that the streets of the town
                    "echoed to the wail of Rachel weeping for her children." Finally, he presented the
                    pioneers as heroes taken to heaven. They had "left this mundane sphere and taken their
                    places in that city eternal, that celestial community .... Their battle is over, their victory is
                        won."<hi rend="sup">60</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since McCarty died in 1934, only his reaction to the early years of the Depression can be noted.
                    Certainly these years seemed to have strengthened his propensity to look backward for guidance
                    concerning the future. Initially, McCarty'S stubborn optimism was unshaken, and he saw no
                    reason to alter his views on the economy. Any tendency to doubt the promise of free enterprise was
                    tempered <list type="footnotes">

                    in American history. Since they were all eventually solved, he could see no reason to expect that
                    the current crisis would be different. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The drought of 1881 affected … [southern Indiana], yet a year or so later but
                            little evidence was visible of the suffering and loss. The dry weather of 1901 also hit
                            Southern Indiana below the belt, but she came up smiling before she was counted out. And now
                            the combined efforts of panic, depression, flood, ice, hot weather, drought, bean bugs and
                            everything else are not going to leave her in as bad shape as people sometimes fear. Count
                            on southern Indiana to come to the front regardless of her losses and suffering. There is
                            always a better time coming and it generally gets here on schedule.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> Following the drought of 1930, however, the specter of death from starvation and
                    malnutrition appeared in McCarty'S column. "This is war," he wrote,
                    "war against hunger and misfortune, and disease. It needs active fighters as does a war
                    whose object is destruction. This is a war for the salvation of humanity … ."<hi rend="sup">62</hi> By the autumn of 1931 a mood of despair could be detected in the examples of
                    poverty brought to McCarty'S attention: a truck driver did not think either of the two
                    families that he had just moved had any food at home; certain parents had no money to buy school
                    lunches. The solution McCarty offered, self-reliance and help from the Red Cross, was not very
                    practical. He considered the Red Cross the most appropriate agency to deal with the crisis; his
                    earlier prejudice against government assistance remained. "There is little need to wait for
                    assistance from legislative bodies or their various committees. If that is all there is in sight for
                    the suffering people, they need God'S pity for their condition and the helplessness of the
                        future."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the early 1930s McCarty showed more strongly than before a tendency to promote modernization in
                    terms of pioneer values. In particular he lauded nineteenth century self-reliance. "Looking
                    back we cannot help pitying these folks [the pioneers] in their isolation, but that very isolation
                    was good, from it developed the strongest type of men and women America has ever produced. Maybe a
                    little more isolation and dependence on self effort would be good in these days."<hi rend="sup">64</hi> One custom he wanted to revive was the practice of lending money to
                    neighbors, which, he said, would give everyone a personal stake in community prosperity. Attacking

                    entrepreneurs. Such an opinion was consistent with views that McCarty expressed in the 1920s. In May
                    of 1920, for example, he wrote that large industrial centers were "unnatural" and
                    their growth detrimental to the rest of the country.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> A few years later, in
                    1932, he forecast a decentralized economy, home-owned and operated industries spread over the
                    country rather than concentrated in a handful of cities.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Also in 1920, in an
                    article entitled "Greatness or Bigness," he reminded readers that the quality of
                    life was not dependent upon the size of the city that one inhabited.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenever McCarty wrote about contemporary conditions, he assumed that there were two conflicting
                    approaches to economic involvement: the spirit of commerce, which few people adhered to, and the
                    more common pattern of economic traditionalism. When he wrote about the past, however, he
                    consistently underestimated the prevalence of traditionalism. McCarty looked to the past for human
                    qualities that he believed to be rare in his day. Most likely, they were as rare in the Martin
                    County of his parents' time.</p>
            <p>McCarty'S statements on economic issues could be interpreted as evidence of the conservatism
                    that Tocqueville believed characteristic of the legal profession. According to the Frenchman,
                    lawyers occupied a central role in the public life of democratic nations. Once the aristocracy had
                    been rejected as natural leaders, lawyers came to replace them, largely due to their occupational
                    skills; and lawyers, already influential, had little to gain by being innovative.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> Although at first glance, McCarty appears to deviate from this pattern since he was in fact
                    promoting social change, as far as the country as a whole was concerned, McCarty'S values
                    were not innovative. McCarty'S writings, however, do not bear out Tocque-ville'S
                    claim that values described in his book would be widely shared by democratic nations in the future.
                    If McCarty'S column is to be believed, in Martin County, and probably in most of southern
                    Indiana, the values inherent in the spirit of commerce were apparently held by only a minority of
                    the population a century after Tocqueville'S visit.</p>

                    </placeName> D. Roosevelt, Ray Allen Billington, and Daniel J. Boorstin) have considered the
                    Northwest Ordinance of 1787 one of the foremost state papers of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. John J. Patrick describes it as "a brillant policy for governing a vast area
                    north and west of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>—a liberal and innovative plan for
                    colonial administration and national development" (p. 1). He further states, "The
                    Northwest Ordinance is indisputably at the core of the American civic heritage, one of the most
                    important political legacies we have" (p. 2).</p>
            <p>Granted, the Northwest Ordinance is one of this country'S basic documents, often grouped in
                    company with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and a few other very select state
                    papers of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Sadly, this select company has not assured the inclusion of its study in American
                    history, government, and civics courses in secondary schools. When it appears in textbooks and
                    curriculum guides, the coverage is often meager. It is not surprising that, although the nation was
                    celebrating the bicentennial of the Northwest Ordinance in 1987, most citizens seemed to know very
                    little about the ordinance. The bicentennial was an opportune time for students to acquire greater
                    knowledge and understanding of the important ideas of this basic document. The need for learning
                    materials on the Northwest Ordinance has been successfully met in the fine set of lessons under
                    review here.</p>
            <p>The teaching plans and learning materials in this volume have been designed to supplement standard
                    secondary school courses in American history, government, and civics. By adapting the length of the
                    reading assignments and providing more extensive directions in completing the lessons, the material
                    can also be made appropriate for middle school/junior high students. The main goals of the lessons
                    are to help students to: (1) know the origins and purposes of the Northwest Ordinance; (2)
                    comprehend civic principles and values of the Northwest Ordinance; (3) know how and <pb n="[283]" id="VAA4025-084-3-073"/>

                    Ordinance in statemaking and national development; (4) understand the significance of the Northwest

                    Northwest Ordinance (p. 3).</p>
            <p>The material selected and prepared by Patrick has many strengths. The lessons are compatible with the
                    curriculum and general objectives of secondary schools. Teachers are provided with ideas and
                    materials that can be used to extend and enrich the usually brief treatment of the Northwest
                    Ordinance in secondary textbooks. The lessons, each of which can be completed in one or two class
                    meetings, are concise, with a clear statement of purposes and well-organized subject matter.
                    Accountability is inherently a part of the lessons since the learning activities require that
                    students demonstrate achievement of the objectives around which the content is structured.
                    Skill-oriented, the lessons involve the students in a wide range of cognitive operations, moving
                    from recall and comprehension to the higher levels of interpretation, analysis, synthesis, and
                    evaluation. The lessons utilize both oral and written experiences, often calling upon students to
                    provide evidence and reasons to support a position that they have taken.</p>
            <p>Teachers should consider these nine lessons on the Northwest Ordinance as a pool of resources. They
                    may select one or several of the lessons to go with the content of a textbook, or they may decide to
                    use all of the nine as part of a special unit on the Northwest Ordinance. Although each lesson can
                    be used alone, it is also possible to teach two or more in combination. All of the necessary
                    materials and a teaching plan for each lesson are included, but the intent is to present suggestions
                    rather than to be prescriptive. Teachers are encouraged to adapt the lessons to fit their own
                    classroom situations and teaching styles.</p>
            <p>Teachers will appreciate the time-saving ease with which they can prepare for using the lessons. They
                    simply need to read the teaching plan and learning materials, make copies of the materials and
                    distribute them to the students, and follow or modify the teaching suggestions. The same clear
                    format is used throughout the lessons. The teaching plan identifies the main points of the lesson,
                    the connections of the lesson to secondary/junior high/middle school social studies, the objectives
                    of the lesson, and suggestions for opening, developing, and concluding the lesson. The learning
                    materials provide for a discussion of the main ideas of the topic, have excerpts from primary
                    sources, and conclude with activities that require students to use the main ideas and evidence found
                    in <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-084-3-075"/> the primary sources. (The full text of fifteen documents
                    related to the Northwest Ordinance is found in the Appendix, readily available for handy reference
                    or for use as additional reading assignments.)</p>
            <p>An overview of the nine lessons reveals a fine developmental plan for learning. The first lesson
                    basically describes the Northwest Territory, its location and its boundaries, and traces its origins
                    as part of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Thus, the context is set for examining the land distribution policies and the
                    governance of the Northwest Territory prior to the Ordinance of 1787. Lesson 2 emphasizes ideas that
                    led to the enactment of the 1787 Northwest Ordinance as students study the Ordinances of 1784 and
                    1785. In Lesson 3 students learn how the Northwest Ordinance was introduced into Congress, and of
                    the deliberation that took place there, and how the proposal was finally enacted. The fourth lesson
                    has students defining key terms and discussing and clarifying the main ideas of the document as they
                    address the question: what is the 1787 Northwest Ordinance? With Lesson 5 students continue to learn
                    about the ordinance by centering on the particular parts that relate to territorial government and
                    attainment of statehood. Lesson 6 focuses on the parts of the Northwest Ordinance that pertain to
                    civil liberties and rights. Students get involved in a study of state making in Lesson 7 as they
                    study the Northwest Ordinance and the time period 1803-1848. A collection of documents is used in
                    Lesson 8 to study Indiana'S road from territory to statehood and to serve as an
                    illustration of the fundamental importance of the Northwest Ordinance. Lesson 9, "Timetable
                    of Main Events Associated with the Enactment and Application of the Northwest Ordinance,"
                    helps students gain a historical perspective of major events relevant to the Northwest Ordinance.</p>
            <p>The lessons are enhanced by the excellent selection of illustrations, maps, and primary sources.
                    Among the illustrations are "The Seal of the Territory of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Northwest of the River <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>"; portraits of George Rogers Clark, Nathan Dane, William Henry Harrison, and
                    others; and photographs of early buildings that have historical significance. The historical maps
                    have obviously been carefully chosen with specific purposes in mind. They are always text-related
                    and properly placed for optimum learning. The primary sources are an integral part of the lessons.
                    In "The Northwest Territory, 1776-1783," for example, students identify and
                    summarize the main ideas of four documents ("Patrick Henry'S Letter to George
                    Rogers Clark," "Resolution of Congress on Public Lands," "Treaty
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>," and "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Act of Cession") in order to explain how each was related to the acquisition
                    of the Northwest Territory by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The concluding part of each lesson, "Reviewing and Reflecting on Facts and Ideas,"
                    is also praiseworthy. Students are involved in <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-084-3-076"/> identifying and
                    summarizing ideas, describing roles taken by specific individuals and comparing and contrasting
                    their views, analyzing and making judgments about information in a primary source, arranging major
                    events in chronological order, interpreting facts in a timetable to see relationships, and on and
                    on. Students not only define terms, they also give examples that fit the definitions, and they
                    explain how the terms are related to the Northwest Ordinance. There is no room here for sheer
                    regurgitation of facts. Higher-level thinking skills are being developed.</p>
            <p>Patrick'S contribution to the study of the Northwest Ordinance is a superb one. With this
                    excellent "classroom ready" set of lessons, teachers will have everything they
                    need to teach a knowledge and understanding of this basic document in America'S heritage.</p>

            <p>Harvey Lewis Carter has written a much-needed biography of Little Turtle—one of the
                    greatest yet least known Indian leaders in American history. The author ably recounts the main
                    episodes in the life of this extraordinary Miami war chief. He explains how Little Turtle'S
                    leadership enabled the Miamis to turn back General Josiah Harmar'S army as it advanced into
                    the Old Northwest in 1790. He details Little Turtle'S role in an even more important battle
                    in 1791, when General Arthur St. Clair led yet another army into Indian country. Although
                    outnumbered, warriors from various tribes of the region, following Little Turtle'S
                    strategy, were able to rout St. Clair'S forces, killing 634 in the process—the
                    single greatest defeat American troops ever suffered at the hands of Indians. (To put it into
                    perspective, Custer and approximately 200 other soldiers died at the Battle of the Little Big Horn).</p>
            <p>Following St. Clair'S defeat, Little Turtle steered a path toward reconciliation with
                    whites. He played a reluctant role in opposing General Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'S army as it advanced into Indian country in 1793-1794 and then helped bring
                    about a peace settlement at the Treaty of Greenville. From that point on Little Turtle, with the
                    help of his white son-in-law, advocated a gradual policy of civilization and assimilation for the
                    Indians. This moderate stance brought him into conflict with more militant Indians such as Tecumseh
                    as well as with single-minded white expansionists like William Henry Harrison, Indiana'S
                    territorial governor.</p>
            <p>Carter argues convincingly that had the Jeffersonians in charge of the federal government lived up to
                    their rhetoric and ideals, the <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-084-3-077"/> Indians' story in the
                    Old Northwest might have turned out for the better. As it was, the unbridled expansionism of
                    land-hungry whites undermined any hopes for peace and led to destructive Indian-white warfare before
                    and during the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>Although Carter'S book is well researched and written, it suffers from one of the main
                    problems inherent in writing Indian history and biographies. The Indian subject has left no written
                    accounts from which to work. As a result, as Carter himself admits in the preface, the
                    book'S "emphasis more often falls upon the times than upon the man" (p.
                    xii). Despite that drawback, Carter'S work is a fine addition to knowledge of American
                    Indian history, frontier history, and the history of Indiana.</p>

            <p>The unique role played by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the site for two distinct attempts at utopia has attracted the attention of such
                    able scholars as Karl J. R. Arndt, Arthur Bestor, Donald E. Pitzer, and William E. Wilson. To their
                    works readers can add, with reservations, this book by Anne Taylor, previously the biographer of
                    Laurence Oliphant. Taylor'S particular strength lies in her portraits of George Rapp,
                    Robert Owen, William Maclure, Frances Wright, and a few of the other fantastic folk who dreamed of
                    an earthly heaven on the banks of the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName>. In general, she tells an
                    interesting tale rather well grounded in primary sources. Although she concentrates on the Owenite
                    period at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> between 1824 and 1828, her narrative extends from late-eighteenth century <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> to mid-nineteenth century America by way of the British Isles, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, D. C.</p>
            <p>The most distinctive characteristic of Taylor'S work is its debunking tendency to explain
                    the behavior of men like Rapp and Owen principally in terms of egotism and self-interest. She
                    portrays Robert Owen, the central figure in the narrative, basically as "a speculative,
                    scheming, mischievious man"—the words of John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName> Adams used as the title of her fourth chapter—who misrepresented his
                    administration at New Lanark and who at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> seemed mainly interested in turning other people'S dreams into ready cash for
                    himself. In her tenth chapter, "The Lord Proprietor"—a title also
                    derived from one of Owen'S many critics—she attributes his disastrous decision
                    to rush the infant experiment prematurely into its mature stage to his desire to force a profitable
                        <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-084-3-078"/> sale of his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> property on the people he had attracted there.</p>
            <p>There is some certainty in the belief that even the greatest man is made of common clay, particularly
                    when the man was as egotistical and self-deceiving as Owen. Taylor'S research has furnished
                    some support for her views, most notably the conclusions of Owen'S numerous critics and
                    enemies. They are, however, only partial truths. What is missing here is any evident appreciation of
                    the thoughts and dreams that gave men like Owen their direction and power. Contrary to its title,
                    this book is not about "visions of harmony," nor is it a study of millenarianism
                    in the nineteenth century or any other time. Rapp'S mysticism and his vision of the Second
                    Coming receive little notice, and there is even less attention given to Owen'S not entirely
                    fatuous hopes of creating a New Moral World from the pains and promises of the industrial
                    revolution.</p>
            <p>In general, Taylor'S reductionism sheds only the dimmest light on the very influences that
                    brought <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> into existence and gave it significance. To those who see history merely as intelligent
                    entertainment, this book will have considerable appeal; to those who look to the past for
                    understanding, however, it will likely yield only a marginal return. <placeName>

            <p>Organized in April, 1864, the Thirteenth Indiana Cavalry was the last cavalry regiment raised in
                    Indiana during the Civil War. It saw action in northern <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and the campaign to capture Mobile. The cavalrymen spent their final months of service
                    as occupation troops in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> where the regiment was mustered out in November, 1865.</p>
            <p>This history is largely a compilation of published reports describing the actions in which the
                    Thirteenth Indiana participated. Although the author'S grandfather, William Powell, was a
                    private in the Thirteenth, the book tells little of the soldier experience. Perhaps unpublished
                    letters or diaries were not available. One such diary of a Sergeant Albert Alyea is cited on page
                    104 of the appendix, but no quotations from it appear in the text. Some previously <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-084-3-079"/> unpublished materials from the regiment'S records in the
                    National Archives were included. Also a complete roster of enlisted men and officers appears on
                    pages 67.98.</p>
            <p>The Thirteenth Indiana was very active although its term of service was of shorter duration than the
                    older Indiana cavalry regiments. The book will be a valuable addition to Indiana Civil War
                    collections since it brings together a complete record of the unit'S service and personnel.</p>

            <p>In 1987 James L. Cooper of Depauw University began a history of Indiana'S bridges and bridge
                    builders while simultaneously preparing an inventory of the surviving structures. This volume
                    summarizes the results of his labors. In Part One, "Public Policy and Private
                    Initiative" (pp. 1-40), Cooper presents a historical overview of the role of bridges in the
                    state'S development, the economic and political issues embodied in bridge construction, and
                    the history of Indiana'S metal bridge fabricators. The section on bridge builders includes
                    lengthy treatment of the Indiana Bridge Company and the Gary plant of the American Bridge Company
                    along with capsule histories of eleven other Hoosier bridge companies.</p>
            <p>The second major segment, "Designing and Fabricating the Hoosier Heritage" (pp.
                    41-109), delineates the types of metal bridges surviving within the state, including truss, arch,
                    girder, suspension, cantilever, and movable spans. Cooper describes the design characteristics of
                    each type of metal bridge as well as the history of each metal bridge type in Indiana. Most of this
                    segment concerns truss bridges, easily the dominant form of metal bridge construction.</p>
            <p>Part Three, "An Inventory of Metal Spans" (pp. 110-201), consists of capsule
                    listings of 1,700 surviving metal bridges built before 1930. The listings are arranged by county and
                    include the following information: the bridge number assigned by the state or <pb n="[290]" id="VAA4025-084-3-080"/>

                    spanned; the number of spans, the bridge type, the builder, and the date built; unusual features;
                    and a historical assessment or rating. Numerous photographs included in this segment mitigate the
                    boredom inherent in a list of this sort.</p>
            <p>Richard A. Gantz of the Indiana Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology wrote the last
                    segment, "An Evaluation of Indiana'S Metal Bridges as Cultural Resources"
                    (pp. 202-209). He outlines the bridge preservation program which grew out of the statewide bridge
                    inventory, including a numerical rating system developed to assess the historical significance of
                    the surviving bridges. However, the relationship between the numerical rating system and the
                    categorical assessment assigned to each bridge in the inventory is not explained. Bridge enthusiasts
                    would also like to know the fate of the timber, stone, and concrete bridges presumably included in
                    the statewide bridge inventory but not discussed in this volume.</p>
            <p>This book would be a more useful reference tool if it had a map of Indiana, showing counties and
                    major rivers. An index is sorely needed as well. This reviewer looked in vain for summary
                    tables— arranged by type, age, length, and fabricator—of the 1,700 bridges
                    inventoried. These caveats aside, this study is an important contribution to the history of metal
                    bridge design and construction in Indiana and in the Great Lakes region.</p>

            <p>When a young woman writes letters to her family at the rate of one or two a day for several years and
                    asks that these intimate letters be saved in manila folders, one might suspect that the writer was
                    extraordinarily devoted to her relatives or that she hoped that the letters might someday compose a
                    book. In the case of Cecilia Hennel Hendricks both suppositions are true. In <hi rend="i">Letters
                        From Honey Hill: A Woman'S View of Homesteading,</hi> Hendricks reveals that she is a
                    devoted daughter but that she also has writing aspirations. Hendricks would be pleased with this
                    book, a compilation of her letters ably put together by her daughter, Cecilia Hendricks Wahl.</p>

                    journey. This book, however, is more than a collection of Hendricks'S correspondence. It is
                    a history of homestead life in the northern plains of Wyoming; it reaffirms that hard work and
                    American know-how pay off; it is a love story—the author had seen her husband only three
                    times before the wedding, and the couple'S growing devotion unfolds in the letters. The
                    book is also a glimpse of Indiana University and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> as they grow parallel with the author'S growing family.</p>
            <p>A woman of determination, Hendricks emphasizes in her letters the homesteader'S daily need
                    to cope with the present with a dose of reflection on the past. She seems to have no fear of the
                    future. She offers matter-of-fact, sometimes hair-raising accounts of the dentistry, family
                    illnesses, and childbirth of the era. Readers glimpse the political climate of a country just
                    opening the doors to women in politics. "… Cox is a real man … and
                    Harding is about the biggest policy shark that you could find in the U. S… . I wonder if
                    he ever had an original thought" (p. 320).</p>
            <p>This collection of letters, however, is not a chronicle of hardship and pioneer struggles. It is a
                    cozy book. The letters are appealingly written, and reading them is like wrapping oneself in a
                    comforter and listening to kitchen conversation about food and recipes, housekeeping hints, the ups
                    and downs of the neighbors, money troubles, fashions, politics, the weather, and entertainment.
                    "This radio is certainly a wonder … we knew by 4:30 that Indiana got beat by
                    Northwestern. Isn't it marvelous to know these things as soon as the people who are
                    actually there?" (p. 637). The tale'S sweetner is honey. Cecilia and John
                    Hendricks chose to set up a beekeeping and honey business on their homestead. Honey drips
                    everywhere, and beekeeping tips and facts abound. All frontier experiences, of course, were not as
                    full of the joy of life as those of the Hendrickses. Yet such was the sweetness of pioneer life for
                    this fortunate family that whipped cream for breakfast was an ordinary occurrence.</p>
            <p>And our final thought as we put the book down is one of gratefulness: social history has been made
                    palatable. We have learned and we have enjoyed the learning.</p>

                    stressing especially the values of business enterprise and the work ethic. Settlement houses
                    connected with local churches were similarly paternalistic, denigrating immigrant culture and
                    encouraging quick assimilation. The International Institute, however, respected immigrant culture,
                    encouraged its survival, provided space for cultural events, and staffed its agency with immigrants.
                    The ethnic churches stood with the International Institute on the side of cultural pluralism.</p>
            <p>The strength of the book lies in its explication of the relations between immigrant groups and the
                    urban institutions under consideration; its weakness is too little discussion of immigrant
                    interactions with each other. <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Steel'S efforts to pit various European immigrant groups against one another
                    during the 1919 strike are overlooked. The degree of fraternization between blacks and European
                    immigrants in the early years is underestimated, as is the degree of black protest throughout the
                    years. The formation of a black ghetto was a somewhat slower process than indicated. Polarization of
                    the black community between integrationists and Garveyites is oversimplified. There is a good
                    discussion of Mexican "repatriation" during the depression, a little information
                    on relations between Mexican and European immigrants, but no discussion of black-Mexican relations.
                    While some of these topics might require extensive interviewing, more information is available than
                    was utilized in the published sources that the authors consulted.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the book is well written and provides valuable information about the immigrants and
                    their interactions with many Gary institutions. Parts of the book, particularly the chapter on the
                    Gary schools and the Wirt system, are both bold and brilliant.</p>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">Plain Ol' Charlie Deam: Pioneer Hoosier Botanist,</hi> Robert C. Kriebel
                    provides an honest and instructive preface with his acknowledgment that "any successful
                    biographer who writes one-third of a century after his subject'S death needs good luck, for
                    most human sources have passed on, written records may be scattered or private, and some information
                    has gone unrecorded" (p. ix). Then he cites a host of sources and collaborators who made
                    possible his remarkable biography. This volume recalls to the Hoosier heritage Charles Clemon Deam,
                        <hi rend="i">the man,</hi> for whom his admirers "named a lake, a national wilderness,
                    a kind of tree and about fifty small plants" (p. vii). In addition, Deam earned three
                    honorary degrees. This great-grandson of German immigrants established his pharmacy at Bluffton,
                    Indiana, and in 1897 hired J. R. Spivey as his business associate. Spivey remained his partner for
                    many years, and this arrangement made possible Deam'S extraordinary career.</p>
            <p>Deam was a self-taught botanist and a respected member of the Indiana Academy of Science. In 1910
                    Governor Thomas R. Marshall appointed him secretary of the Indiana Board of Forestry and, with the
                    state geologist, placed him on the Indiana Conservation Commission. When Richard Lieber became
                    chairman of the local board of managers of the Fifth National Conservation Congress, a preservation
                    partnership was born. "The long and cooperative friendship between hard-driving Lieber and
                    the hyperactive Deam grew out of that 1912 Congress" (p. 43). However, because of
                    Deam'S refusal to contribute to Governor Samuel M. Ralston'S "Two Per
                    Cent Club" (which would have amounted to thirty-six dollars of his annual salary), Deam
                    lost his appointment to the Forestry Board. By 1917, with the help of Lieber and Purdue'S
                    Dean Stanley Coulter, Deam was reappointed to his old job, "snarling at the stenographers,
                    bossing the field hands at the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName> State Forest, motoring around the counties and townships with a modest state expense
                    account, and flashing the silver badge of acting state forester" (p. 52).</p>
            <p>With the possible exception of his only real mentor, Coulter, it can be said that Indiana'S
                    botanical beginnings are the lengthened shadow of one man—Charles Deam. Four solid
                    volumes, written between 1911 and 1940, remain a celebration of his dedication and scholarship: <hi rend="i">Flora of Indiana, Shrubs of Indiana, Trees of Indiana,</hi> and <hi rend="i">Grasses of
                        Indiana.</hi> "Indiana University students in <placeName>

                    shelved the man'S three-thousand-volume botanical library" (p. vii). His herbarium
                    was the product of years of field work and over 100,000 miles of travel across Indiana'S
                    landscapes. If this legacy were not enough, for thirty years Deam annually published <hi rend="i">Deam'S Almanac</hi> from his Bluffton drug store.</p>
            <p>A born curmudgeon, Charlie criticized the academicians of his day, whom he charged with spending much
                    time on campus and little in the field. Yet he did maintain very close professional and personal
                    ties with many scientists in Indiana and the nation. His experience as a graduate of the
                    "College of Hard Knocks" made him caustic and defensive. No subject was spared.
                    "Our schools are saturated with athletics which, for the most part, are the skidway to
                    hell. Can you remember the old fashioned spelling bees? People had just as much interest in them as
                    in basketball and I am certain the net results were much better. If we must have physical
                    competition, let me see who can dig the longest ditch in the shortest time. I am strong for physical
                    education, but a deadly foe for competitive athletics" (p. 95).</p>
            <p>Fortunately for Charles Clemon Deam and for posterity, Kriebel and Purdue University Press have
                    defied the longueurs of time to create this admirable portrait of a pioneer Hoosier botanist. Editor

            <p>This book is a valuable compilation of materials despite numerous drawbacks. George C. Roberts has
                    used the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> papers at the University of Notre Dame, and his account is dispassionate and generally
                    reliable. The book is of convenient size, only two hundred pages, and the notes are placed handily
                    at the end of each chapter. Unfortunately, the volume leaves too many questions unanswered. For
                    example, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> was suspected of being ambitious. Did he hope for nomination to elected office? What
                    does it say about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the man who believed civil rights was the nation'S most important issue, that
                    before election as national chairman he signed a pledge not to make segregation an issue? The pledge
                    appeased southern members of the party but apparently repudiated <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'S convictions. And what was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'S attitude toward other events of his time? The reader has only a vague notion
                    of the influence of McCarthyism, the Korean war and its aftermath, the sputnik crisis, and Martin
                    Luther King'S activities. Finally, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'S contribution is not clear. This lack of clarity may stem from the
                    book'S overlapping, topical organization. What, for example, was the effect of the party
                    chairman'S ignorance of foreign relations and acceptance of partisanship as a political
                    principle? One especially would like to know <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'S importance in the John F. Kennedy nomination and victory in 1960.</p>
            <p>Other deficiencies include cumbersome sentences and paragraphs that fail to carry a theme and the
                    fact that the book relies on manuscripts and secondary sources in political science but reveals
                    little knowledge of the historical literature on the Eisenhower presidency or on the election of
                    1960. Finally, there is no bibliography. Useful perhaps for specialists and graduate students, this
                    book is ill-suited for both undergraduates and general readers.</p>

                    </placeName> Judge Charles Willing Byrd of Sinking Spring, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, became interested in the Shakers at Pleasant Hill when family members were part of a
                    mob that attacked the community in 1825. He investigated the faith of the Shakers, stated his
                    intention to join the society, and in June, 1826, sent his twenty-year-old son, William S. Byrd, to
                    live at Pleasant Hill.</p>
            <p>The Shakers seemed awed by the prospects of a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> judge as a potential convert and treated his son, a descendant of <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-084-3-089"/> the noted Byrd family of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, with deference. Despite the spartan life-style of the Shakers and their insistence
                    upon community labor, young Byrd, who lived the life of an honored guest, was provided with his own
                    apartment, his own stove, and his own schedule and, in fact, appeared to do little except take walks
                    and write an occasional letter.</p>
            <p>William wrote his father a series of letters that have been preserved with other Byrd family
                    manuscripts at the Lilly Library at Indiana University. Transcripts of these letters, which comprise
                    but forty-six pages of this slim volume, are preceded by a 47-page introduction and are followed by
                    sixty-three pages of appendixes, notes, and index.</p>
            <p>The letters themselves are disappointing in their content. While William lived among the brothers and
                    sisters and had access to the inner circle of the elders, the writings dwell on business
                    transactions between William, Charles, and the Shakers and on the health of father and son. Little
                    light is shed on the day-to-day life of the village. The insight the letters provide into the
                    insidious dissent among the western Shaker communities in this era is perhaps their greatest value.
                    This dissension was the beginning of a long, slow decline of Shaker life. Slight reference is made
                    to the abandonment of West Union, or Busro, the Indiana Shaker village. The letters stopped with the
                    unexpected death of Judge Byrd in August, 1828. William never became a Shaker during his two years
                    at Pleasant Hill; however, when he died five months later in January, 1829, he left a will
                    bequeathing his property to the Shakers.</p>
            <p>Stephen J. Stein has provided an extensive and well-written introduction to the letters and an
                    appendix of other relevant documents. The value of the book would have been enhanced by
                    transcription of letters between Charles W. Byrd and Frances Voris, the Shaker trustee; diary notes
                    of Charles W. Byrd about the Shakers; and other Charles W. Byrd letters containing Shaker
                    references. Two letters written by Charles W. Byrd to William S. Byrd are included in the appendix
                    but could have appeared chronologically with the William S. Byrd letters. Endnotes would be easier
                    to use if in consecutive numerical order from beginning to end rather than beginning again with each
                    section.</p>
            <p>Manuscript material from Pleasant Hill is scant. In contrast to the very restrictive policy of one
                    major repository of Shaker manuscript materials, permission to publish these letters by the Lilly
                    Library is to be commended as a welcome addition to Shaker scholarship.</p>

                    </placeName> state politics during the time period 1930-1963. Originally the author intended to
                    write a brief review of Bert T. Combs'S years as governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> (1959-1963), but the material grew and grew until Pearce produced this 247-page book.</p>
            <p>Three Democrats, A. B. (Happy) Chandler, Earle C. Clements, and Combs, are the book'S major
                    protagonists. Unfortunately, these men did not work together but rather often opposed each other to
                    the great detriment of the state. Of the three, Chandler appears as the "heavy"
                    because, among other defects, he did not want to share the political spotlight with anyone else and
                    was a person who put his career ahead of the interests and needs of the commonwealth of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Combs is Pearce'S hero because he believes Combs performed excellently as
                    governor. Combs tried hard and made important though sometimes politically unpopular decisions
                    (e.g., raising taxes) as he attempted to get the state "going." A detailed
                    discussion of Combs'S political career and tenure as governor makes up the main portion of
                    this volume.</p>
            <p>Pearce'S first chapters cover the early history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> politics. The author barely mentions Republican party politicians because during the
                    thirty-three years covered by the book, they were a distinct minority and did not play a major role
                    in the state'S political development.</p>
            <p>According to Pearce, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> suffers from many deep-seated problems and long-term deficiencies, such as an
                    economically poor population and an antiquated state Constitution that was last revised in 1891.
                    This second problem is compounded by present-day resistance to a sweeping overhaul of the
                    Constitution. Governors cannot succeed themselves in office (which may be a good idea). Moreover,
                    elected officials are unwilling to levy and raise taxes to support the state government and to help
                    solve the state'S critical needs for better education, highways, and social programs.
                    Perhaps most importantly, there is an overriding and transcendent preoccupation with the game of
                    politics. As the title of this book indicates, the state is divided geographically, politically, and
                    economically. Dissent between the groups dominates over the body politic'S ability to work
                    together to bring <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> into the mainstream of mid-twentieth century America.</p>
            <p>The book is well written. It is a frank and somewhat cynical view of the fascinating history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> politics. While there are no footnotes or documentation in the text, a three-page
                    bibliography appears at the end. Two sections of black-and-white photographs add to the
                    reader'S enjoyment of the text.</p>

            <p>In this book Ronald Edsforth provides an account of Flint automobile workers in the twentieth
                    century. Although the title speaks of "cultural consensus" and of the
                    "making of a mass consumer society," in fact the author has little to say about
                    these intriguing but vague topics. This is not surprising since the forces shaping a cultural
                    consensus and a mass consumer society have been more national than local in origin and focus. A case
                    study approach yields relatively little where such large and fuzzy abstractions are concerned. The
                    author does present a narrative that combines the development of Flint'S automobile
                    industry and work force with an account of a few short-lived attempts to establish a radical
                    political presence in the city.</p>
            <p>The story begins with the General Motors Corporation and William C. Durant. From the automobile
                    industry'S early days through the 1920s the work force quiescently submitted to the
                    manufacturer'S domination of the factories. There is little evidence of class consciousness
                    or conflict. For practical purposes labor organizations did not exist, and a brief socialist
                    political movement prior to World War I left no lasting impression. The Great Depression generated
                    class feeling and produced the organization of the United Automobile Workers in Flint as in other
                    automobile manufacturing centers. Also important were the efforts of the American Federation of
                    Labor and the surge forward of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which climaxed in the great
                    sit-down strike of 1936-1937. Political radicalism made little headway among the rank and file as
                    Democrats such as President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> D. Roosevelt and Governor Frank Murphy captured the political loyalty of most workers.</p>
            <p>In the final chapters Edsforth traces the decline of class feeling among the workers, attributing
                    much of it to Walter P. Reuther, president of the UAW after 1946. Some historians may believe that
                        <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-084-3-092"/> the turn toward a more stable, less contentious union
                    stemmed more from pressures within the ranks than Edsforth allows.</p>
            <p>Although the outlines of this story are familiar to automobile industry historians, Edsforth is the
                    first writer to provide a consecutive, detailed account of Flint workers. Hampered by a paucity of
                    primary materials for the years prior to the Great Depression, the author makes good use of the more
                    extensive documentation that accompanied and resulted from the establishment of the UAW in Flint and
                    the emergence of the industry'S workers from the shadows of a company town into the
                    brighter and warmer sunlight of a union city.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Crown and Calumet</hi> is a wide-ranging inquiry into the symbiotic relationship that
                    endured for three decades during which Britons and Indians shared an antagonism toward the infant <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and its people. Although Colin G. Calloway'S alliterative title implies a
                    narrative covering the policies and activities of both parties in this frontier partnership, his
                    interests do not lie in events and their explanation. Rather, his concerns revolve around the
                    attitudes and perceptions of both Britons and Indians and upon the circumstances that characterized
                    their interplay. Consequently, between introductory and concluding surveys of the situations in 1783
                    and in 1815, he organizes his materials into nine topical chapters that examine cultural
                    impressions, commercial interchanges, and military collaborations from both British and Indian
                    vantages. Each chapter presents many related generalizations, each supported by brief examples drawn
                    randomly from all the years under consideration and from across all North America west of the
                    Appalachians.</p>
            <p>While touching upon myriad components of Anglo-Indian involvement, Calloway focuses on the two
                    overriding concerns of both parties—namely military and commercial. After 1783, as he
                    reiterates repeatedly, "Britons and Indians found themselves bound by a common fear of
                    American expansion and a joint determination to protect the fur-bearing wilderness from the land
                    hungry settlers of the young Republic" (p. 6). Calloway sees their relationship as balanced
                    precariously on three boundaries: the international borders between British, Spanish, and American
                    possessions; the changing lines between American settlement and Indian lands; and the cultural <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-084-3-093"/> barriers that hampered their mutual efforts to defend the first
                    two through practical military cooperation and profitable commercial exchange. In essence, the
                    British-Indian teaming was one of necessity and opportunism, an always uneasy and unstable entente
                    held together solely by firepower and furs. Calloway asserts that most crown and tribal leaders
                    recognized the calculated pragmatism that underlay their dealings, but his research also indicates
                    that little empathy or fondness existed between Britons and Indians.</p>
            <p>Calloway'S conclusions are persuasive because he bases them upon an impressive array of
                    primary sources as well as recent ethnohistorical studies. He also understands and overcomes the
                    dangers lurking in the ethnocentrically biased writings of his eighteenth and nineteenth century
                    commentators. Other than an inadequate index that lists mainly personal and place names, the
                    work'S only shortcomings result from its topical approach. The text sometimes becomes less
                    an investigation than a compilation of the observations Calloway has collected. Of more importance,
                    he never defines what makes this association and these years unique when compared to other
                    white-Indian relationships and other eras.</p>
            <p>In one sense, however, this weakness of <hi rend="i">Crown and Calumet</hi> is also its greatest
                    strength. Within its circumscribed topical parameters, Calloway excels in explaining the social,
                    political, and economic contexts that are indispensable background for anyone engaged in reading,
                    researching, or teaching about interethnic contacts anywhere along the early North American
                    frontier. Although the book does not give a comprehensive, coherent account of British-Indian
                    affairs in the Old Northwest or elsewhere during the post-Revolution era, it does set down the
                    interpretive foundation essential to prepare the narrative overview still wanted of the
                    British-Indian alliance that challenged but failed to halt the expansion of American settlement for
                    thirty years. One hopes that Calloway, who here demonstrates his mastery of the relevant sources and
                    their meaning, will continue his project by undertaking such a survey.</p>

            <p>This book presents the autobiography and scattered writings of a pioneer farmer and juxtaposes his
                    narrative and experience <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-084-3-094"/> with the realities of history and the
                    myths, songs, and literary tradition of the rural Middle West. The autobiography—the work
                    of Omar Morse, maternal great-grandfather of the author—is a unique document. There are
                    all too few memoirs of migrating farmers, farm laborers, and small-town craftsmen. The
                    autobiography, roughly seventy pages in length, covers the last three-quarters of the nineteenth
                    century and offers a personal view of social and technological change and economic trends as well as
                    a rare insight into the rural mentality.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, James M. Marshall has not served his ancestor well. His editing of the autobiography
                    and letters is pedestrian. His effort to set the autobiography in a literary context seems strained
                    if not overblown. The autobiography can carry Hamlin Garland but not William Dean Howells and
                    Theodore Dreiser. The historical treatment is little better. It is marred by small errors and large
                    misunderstandings. Marshall links and praises C. Vann Woodward and Richard Hofstadter on Populism as
                    if they agreed. He confuses the reader by using the word <hi rend="i">homestead</hi> to mean a place
                    of residence as well as land obtained under the Homestead Law. Morse, incidentally, never
                    homesteaded, but Marshall insists that he failed not primarily because of cyclical depressions but
                    because the government'S land policy served the speculators and not the real farmers in the
                    Midwest. He raises the issue of Populist anti-Semitism from long-exploded sources. Ironically,
                    Morse'S autobiography is devoid of prejudice, but Marshall does not see in this further
                    proof to refute Hofstadter, Oscar Handlin, <hi rend="i">et al.</hi> For him, it seems, absence of
                    evidence is not evidence of absence.</p>
            <p>The autobiography is very revelatory. Morse is a typical pioneer farmer, breaking lands, building
                    farms, and drifting. He sells off improvements or fails to make payments on loans. He suffers the
                    hardships of labor, but he is never without capital, can always borrow, and he seems even in poor
                    times to have resources. He is euchred out of money through innocence; physicans charge outrageous
                    fees to treat his fatally ill wife; and his family and friends often prove to be the real Shylocks
                    in his life. Cherishing his freedom to farm, or loaf, or visit, Morse at the end advises his son,
                    who works for the railroad, to get some land so he can be independent of employers. Morse turned the
                    Jeffersonian myth into a reality. One can only wonder what he would have thought of his descendant
                    who writes of him as both a victim of the system and a gullible loser.</p>

            <p>Noble E. Cunningham, Jr., set himself the prodigious task of writing the biography of Thomas
                    Jefferson in 350 pages. This enterprise, requiring extensive knowledge of the sources, a sure grasp
                    of the historical literature, and a firm understanding of the history encompassed by a life of
                    eighty-three momentous years, has been fulfilled. <hi rend="i">In Pursuit of Reason</hi> chronicles
                    Jefferson'S achievements and shows his commitment to "the sufficiency of reason
                    for the care of human affairs" (p. xv).</p>
            <p>Cunningham includes the essentials, but the result is a life that is somewhat lifeless. The details
                    that animate a story are too often missing, sacrificed to exigencies of space. This vagueness is
                    especially true for the period of Jefferson'S presidency, when the need to explain the
                    history of the time leaves little space for personal matters. The specifics of presidential actions
                    are not always clear. For example, though Cunningham says that in order to enforce the embargo the
                    Jefferson administration was forced to carry out some arbitrary measures, he does not explain what
                    those were. A similar sketchiness mars his description of Jefferson'S years as governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Cunningham'S emphasis on Jefferson'S love of reason shortchanges the
                    Virginian'S passions. Readers never see the man getting mad or having fun.
                    Jefferson'S pursuit of Aaron Burr and his feud with John Adams were not entirely
                    reasonable. His fear of the Federalists, though founded on specific justifiable complaints, was also
                    founded partly on irrational beliefs. A more direct confrontation of these issues would help the
                    reader to understand several unexplained incidents in Jefferson'S life.
                    Jefferson'S encouragement of prosecutions against Federalist editors, for example, is
                    described simply as "surprising to read today," but further treatment of this
                    issue might have thrown some light on the president'S motives and beliefs. Cunningham had
                    no room to deal separately with Jefferson'S political thought except as it related
                    specifically to the events of his political career. The reader, though, needs to have a better
                    understanding of Jefferson'S basic philosophy in order to appreciate that career.</p>
            <p>Cunningham'S treatment of the writing of the Declaration of Independence is a marvel of
                    concision, providing in just a few choice phrases summaries of the mountains of material written on
                    this important subject. Other especially successful sections clarify the confusing election of 1800
                    and recount the story of Jefferson'S fight <pb n="306" id="VAA4025-084-3-096"/> to found
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. This enterprise aptly fits the author'S theme: Jefferson'S
                    commitment to make reason rule all aspects of human endeavor. Being only human, Jefferson failed to
                    live up to his ideals, and it is this human side of Jefferson that Cunningham'S biography
                    unfortunately neglects. The care with which Cunningham has presented the events of
                    Jefferson'S public career, however, will make his book a much-consulted source.</p>

            <p>The past generation has seen an outpouring of biographies of antislavery figures, some volumes
                    pedestrian, some inspired, most somewhere in between. The best have not only illuminated their
                    subjects but have served as vehicles for major reinterpretations or important new insights into
                    antebellum reform. Gamaliel Bailey deserves full-length biographical treatment as much as any
                    previous subject, and Stanley Harrold'S work falls into the inspired category. It is
                    impressively researched, is in discourse with the relevant secondary literature, and is conceptually
                    coherent. It presents a solid account of Bailey'S life and provides valuable, although not
                    striking, insights into the larger antislavery movement.</p>
            <p>Bailey (1807-1859) was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, studied medicine in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and edited a Methodist periodical there before settling in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1832. Almost by chance he found himself attached to the faculty of Lane Seminary as
                    a physiology instructor. The famous Lane debates of 1834 swept Bailey into the immediate
                    abolitionist movement. Soon he found himself on the staff and later editor of the leading western
                    abolitionist organ, the <hi rend="i">Philanthropist.</hi> Bailey made the periodical a voice for
                    "moderate" abolition, Liberty party politics in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana, and opposition to the radicalism of William Lloyd Garrison.</p>
            <p>Late in 1846 Bailey moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D. C., to edit the <hi rend="i">National Era,</hi> which under his leadership became
                    the most widely read antislavery journal in the country. Bailey'S greatest coup, albeit an
                    unwitting one, came in 1851 when he began to serialize the hitherto unknown Harriet Beecher
                    Stowe'S <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom'S Cabin.</hi> Bailey also served as a leading
                    antislavery lobbyist in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and was an intimate of Salmon P. Chase, Joshua R. Giddings, and Charles Sumner.
                    Ironically, even though Bailey gave early support to the organization of the Republican party, it
                    was that party'S absorption of antislavery politics that sent the <hi rend="i">Era</hi>
                    into a slow decline.</p>
            <p>Bailey'S personal papers have been lost, so Harrold'S book is necessarily a public
                    biography. It places Bailey in the context of his times, analyzing his political and economic
                    thought as well as <pb n="307" id="VAA4025-084-3-097"/> his views on reform. In short, this is a
                    competent work that will probably stand as the definitive biography of its subject.</p>

            <p>Inspired by visits to a dozen battle sites, Emory M. Thomas, professor of history at the University

                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and author of several scholarly books on the Civil War, offers a dozen brief
                    meditations on the great conflict. He begins with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, backtracks to John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'S raid on Harper'S Ferry, and from there proceeds through selected
                    episodes of the war to Joseph E. Johnston'S surrender to William T. Sherman at Bennett

                    </placeName>, on April 26, 1865. One of his recurring themes is the contrast that he perceived,
                    during his travels, between the noble past and the tawdry present. The louts of today litter the
                    scenes of past glories and sufferings—of which they know next to nothing— with
                    the plastic detritus of a civilization gone soft.</p>
            <p>Some of the meditations come off nicely and may be read as small-scale prose elegies on the horrors
                    of human conflict. Others, for example the short one about Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pulaski</settlement>
                    </placeName> on its island near Savannah, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, fall rather flat, even though Thomas uses Percy Bysshe Shelley'S
                    "Ozymandias" to reinforce his point about the vanity of fixed fortifications and
                    neatly slips in an allusion to Heracleitus'S philosophy of history.</p>
            <p>Indiana readers may be interested in the author'S references to General Lew Wallace at the
                    battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> (the general'S failure to bring his division decisively into action at an
                    opportune moment is charitably ascribed to muddled orders and to the complexities of the terrain)
                    and to novelist Kurt Vonnegut, whose optimistic speech on nuclear peace, given in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    Entrails and Petersburg." One regrets, from the hard-core Hoosier point of view, that there
                    are no allusions, once Thomas has dealt with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to the participation of the numerous Indiana volunteer regiments in the other
                    engagements he has chosen as starting points for his reflections. Indiana was present with
                    distinction at several of them.</p>
            <p>The attractively printed text is flawed in minor ways. Some of the illustrations are a bit murky. It
                    is difficult, for example, to see <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-084-3-098"/> clearly the eponymous exposed
                    guts in the photograph of the dead Rebel soldier at Petersburg. Editorial whimsy has converted the
                    good old word <hi rend="i">intact</hi> into the meaningless prepositional phrase <hi rend="i">in
                        tact</hi> (p. 43). The speed, such as it was, of the Confederate casemate ram <placeName>

                    informed that all Union ironclad warships of the period were designated monitors (p. 112). They were
                    not, simply because not quite all of them were monitors, a welldefined type even in the 1860s.
                    Finally, a skirmish at a road <hi rend="i">juncture</hi> is mentioned (p. 129). An adequate index
                    and some informative maps are present, but footnotes and a bibliography are lacking.</p>
            <p>Such faults notwithstanding, Thomas has done a fine, thoughtful, and enormously well-informed job on
                    what is, in a way, a print version of Modest Mussorgsky'S "Pictures at an
                    Exhibition." His stops along the chronological path to examine various Civil War actions
                    and their implications for posterity generally produce evocative and moving battle pieces. One can
                    read this elegant volume, enjoy it, and learn from it even if one is not a Civil War enthusiast.</p>

            <p>How well the moral vitality of the American middle-class family survived the nineteenth
                    century'S demographic and cultural disruptions remains the subject of keen scholarly
                    debate. Colleen McDannell'S meticulous comparison of shifting religious habits fostered
                    among Protestant and Irish Catholic households reaches conclusions more affirmative than many. She
                    argues that the behavior patterns urged upon Victorian family members by advice writers, novelists,
                    architects, advertisers, and religious professionals ultimately produced a domestic religion so
                    strong and comfortable that, among Protestants at least, it came to rival formal churches in
                    sustaining piety. As responsibility for religious nurture of the young shifted decisively from
                    Evangelical pulpit to Protestant parlor in post-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> America, the home became (in Peter Berger'S borrowed phrase) a
                    "sacred canopy" for the protection of family virtue. To enforce this shift, Gothic
                    architectural forms and religious iconography were promoted with the aim of transforming private
                    dwelling space into dramatic visual expressions of Christian morality. McDannell mistrusts the
                    notion that domestic religion can be defined simply as a retreat from the public or social sector.
                    The Christian home she depicts is one that resonated with the religious culture surrounding it. It
                    is also a home that, as others have noted, <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-084-3-099"/> was increasingly
                    feminized in mood. The inherited "paternal model" for family devotion, stressing
                    obedience to stern male authority in the Protestant combat between sin and salvation, slowly yielded
                    to the gentler, more affectionate terms of the "maternal model," centering on the
                    mother-child bond. McDannell suggests, but does not really spell out, a causal relation between this
                    change and the general softening of Protestant theology across the century.</p>
            <p>Perhaps most fresh and valuable about McDannell'S study are the contrasts she develops
                    between Protestant and Catholic modulations of domestic ideology. Owing to Catholic emphasis on
                    male-administered rituals of worship within the sacred structure of the church and Irish Catholic
                    preoccupation with the goal of binding male immigrants more closely to their families, the Catholic
                    version of feminized domestic piety lagged decades behind its Protestant counterpart, not maturing
                    until century'S end. Despite this lag, and despite important differences that she notes in
                    the temper of the rival faiths—Protestant striving versus Catholic assurance—
                    McDannell ventures the thought that mututal agreement on the value of the moral home provided both
                    constituencies with a common language with which to speak to each other. For this and other reasons
                    she finds the growth of domestic religion a mainstay of cultural cohesion in Victorian America.</p>

            <p>"<hi rend="i">The World of Hope"</hi> is an effort to reexamine the values and
                    convictions of men and women who sought to reform society during the Progressive Era. Dismissing
                    those who emphasize self-interested motives or who suggest that the reforms in this period can best
                    be understood in such terms as "modernization," David B. Danbom paints a picture
                    of progressive reformers as idealists, men and women who sought to restore to public life the high
                    standards and values that characterized their Christian, Victorian upbringing. They were
                    "Christian progressives" who "believed that as men and women put the law
                    of love into operation in their daily lives as voters, workers, employers, consumers and neighbors,
                    the problem of public life would disappear" (p. 84). By about 1910, Danbom argues, some
                    reformers looked to science rather than Christianity for remedies to the problems of society. These
                    "scientific progressives" were more willing to "modernize values and
                    alter reality" (p. 115). They shared with "Christian progressives,"
                    however, the <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-084-3-100"/> naive belief that abuses could be easily
                    eliminated and virtue restored to a dominant place in American public life.</p>
            <p>Although progressivism was destroyed by World War I, Danbom asserts that the seeds of the decline of
                    progressivism can be found in the failure of these well-meaning reformers fully to comprehend the
                    forces shaping twentieth century America. The movement must be understood as a noble failure that
                    presaged a general decline in the quality of public life in America which continues to the present.
                    "The <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>," the author concludes, "has had precious little reason to be proud
                    since the end of the progressive era" (p. 231).</p>
            <p>Danbom'S analysis is provocative but sometimes overstated and oversimplified. He uses terms
                    such as "progressive" and "progressivism" without reference to
                    the rich historiographical debate concerning the various meanings and connotations of these words.
                    His suggestion that "progressive" and "liberal" are synonymous
                    does not clarify matters. Readers never learn which figures or groups in this period fit into the
                    categories of "Christian" and "scientific progressives."
                    Danbom'S commentary too often takes on a polemical quality.</p>
            <p>"<hi rend="i">The World of Hope"</hi> recalls the idealism that pervaded this
                    important period in American history, and it describes well the origins of this attitude. Although
                    much of what Danbom says is not original, he has provided a framework through which aspects of this
                    era can better be understood. The book falls short, however, of being a persuasive reinterpretation
                    of reform efforts in this important period.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Urban America in the Modern Age, 1920 to the Present.</hi> By Carl Abbott. (Arlington
                    Heights, Ill.: Harlan Davidson, Inc., 1987. Pp. viii, 181. Tables, maps, illustration,
                    bibliographical essay, index. Paperbound, $8.95.)</head>
            <p>The study of modern urban history is a multifaceted discipline. Using traditional narrative sources
                    and now, more frequently, statistics derived from a plethora of governmental and private studies,
                    the urban historian must deal with issues as diverse as immigration and ethnicity, transport
                    systems, and water supply. The investigation of any single city can be long and complex; it is
                    therefore all the more remarkable that Carl Abbott has produced a well-balanced overview of American
                    urban history since 1920 in his slim text, <hi rend="i">Urban America in the Modern Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-084-3-101"/>
            <p>Abbott'S book, part of the American History Series under the editorship of John Hope <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Abraham S. Eisenstadt, is noteworthy in several respects. Most importantly, Abbott
                    avoids the common urban survey pitfall of limiting his examples to major cities such as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Rather, he illustrates issues in urban history by using examples from cities as
                    diverse in size, location, and background as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Dallas, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Birmingham, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>. Within these cities and many others he touches upon a variety of urban themes,
                    including the changing nature of immigration, business, industry, suburbanization, labor, and
                    politics. Tables and maps help to illustrate issues such as population growth, population movement
                    during World War 11, and even racial tension; they are located adjacent to relevant portions of the
                    text and are therefore quite useful. A three-part division of the time period covered (1920-1940,
                    "The First Modern Cities"; 1940-1960, "Building and Rebuilding";
                    and 1960-1980, "A New Urban America") seems historically valid and moreover
                    provides a strong framework for the variety of information in the book. Although not footnoted, the
                    book includes a sixteen-page thematically arranged bibliographic essay that contains citations to
                    the most recent works in the field as well as to classics in urban history. A fifteen-page index
                    provides both subject and proper name access to the text.</p>
            <p>While some urban history is made almost unreadable by the heavy use of statistics, Abbott'S
                    book is well written. The narrative is often enhanced by references drawn from classic urban
                    fiction, such as Sinclair Lewis'S <hi rend="i">Babbitt,</hi> Frank
                    O'Connor'S <hi rend="i">The Last Hurrah,</hi> and John Updike'S Rabbit
                    Angstrom series. The points drawn from these works fit neatly into the text and help to illustrate
                    issues such as the conveniences of modern life, urban politics, or the deterioration of small urban
                    centers (the fictional town of Brewer in the Updike series). In some instances, however, the use of
                    illustrations from popular culture is taken too far. Offlanded references to Archie Bunker or Rocky
                    Balboa may well be lost on some readers whose level of cultural literacy may not include the media
                    phenomena of the 1970s.</p>
            <p>These are, however, minor criticisms. <hi rend="i">Urban America in the Modern Age</hi> is an
                    extraordinarily good short survey of modern urban history; and while directed toward the college
                    classroom, it would make excellent reading for nonstudents as well.</p>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">A Generation of Boomers</hi> Shelton Stromquist undertakes the daunting task of
                    explaining the recurrent labor conflict on the nation'S railroads from the 1870s through
                    the 1890s. A central concept in this wide-ranging book is that of a labor
                    "frontier." When railroads entered a new region, labor scarcity enabled railroad
                    workers— many of them "boomers," itinerants quick to move on at the
                    slightest provocation—to demand good wages and a strong voice in determining work rules.
                    Frontier conditions prevailed across much of the nation in the late 1870s but disappeared as the
                    rail network expanded. Thus, workers gradually lost their "frontier" advantages,
                    tempting railroad corporations to cut wages and seek control of the work process. The ongoing battle
                    over such changes fueled the strikes of the late nineteenth century. When the railroad brotherhoods
                    proved incapable of staving off management incursions, workers experimented with other forms of
                    organization. The ultimate expression of nineteenth century railroad worker consciousness was Eugene
                    V. Debs'S American Railway Union. The ARU had the potential to play a pivotal role in the
                    development of the American working class but was caught up in the bitter Pullman Boycott of 1894
                    before it was strong enough to withstand the combination of private economic power and government
                    repression thrown against it.</p>
            <p>During the final decades of the nineteenth century railroad managers began to develop systematic
                    labor relations policies, primarily in response to labor unrest. Again, the Pullman Boycott was
                    crucial. This challenge showed managers the necessity of controlling their employees; their
                    inability to break the boycott without massive federal intervention argued for an ongoing government
                    presence in railroad labor relations; and the threat posed by the ARU convinced them that the safer
                    brotherhoods should be encouraged. Soon a new framework for railroad labor relations was
                    constructed. Under this new order railroads adopted personnel policies designed to monitor and
                    discipline workers. Certain managerial abuses were legally proscribed, but the permanent threat of
                    injunctions left little doubt about which side the federal government would take in serious labor
                    disputes. Skilled workers, represented by the brotherhoods, won good wages and working conditions
                    but at the cost of their solidarity with their less-skilled brethren. Railroaders faced a choice.
                    They could accept the new regime, thereby abandoning the values and perquisites that had melded them
                    into an articulate, class-conscious group. Or they could, like Debs, conclude that labor questions
                    and political power were so entwined that a workers' movement that did not enter the
                    political sphere <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-084-3-103"/> was futile. Debs soon led the remnants of the
                    ARU into the Social Democracy of America.</p>
            <p>Stromquist explores many other questions, including the nature of community support for railroad
                    strikers and the role of the Knights of Labor in railroad worker organization. His use of the
                    concept of a "labor force life cycle" is particularly intriguing. The scope of
                    this impressive book sometimes makes for difficult going; the complex material treated here is not
                    easily organized, necessitating much repetition and shifting between topics. The introductory
                    chapter fails to prepare the reader for what is to come, although the chapter summaries are very
                    helpful. Stromquist sometimes works with a narrow research base; a few cities provide most of the
                    data for some interpretations. While this obviously was necessary for a manageable project, much
                    "fine-tuning" probably remains to be done through studies of other railroad towns.
                    The author gathered his strike data from reports published by the office of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> commissioner of labor for the years 1881-1894. These reports are a rich and largely
                    untapped resource but must be used with caution: if the experience of this reviewer in studying one
                    midwestern city is any indication, they can greatly underreport strikes.</p>
            <p>These are minor concerns. Stromquist provides a fascinating look at railroad labor during a crucial
                    period in the nation'S history, presenting insights of such broad significance that this
                    book should be of interest to all historians of the American working class.</p>

            <p>The now ubiquitous tractor is a relative newcomer to American farms. Steam tractors proved too
                    cumbersome and heavy to become widely adopted, and the internal combustion engine, which quickly
                    brought the automobile to the nation'S streets, proved difficult to adapt to farm tractors.
                    The major problem was technological; the successful tractor had to be more than a motor-driven
                    horseless carriage. To be useful and economical tractors had to be powerful yet small and cheap
                    enough for small farmers, which meant that they had to be versatile enough to do the many different
                    tasks performed by horses and mules while costing less to buy, operate, and maintain than the
                    animals they would replace. In addition, tractors and implements had to be adapted to each other,
                    requiring cooperative and coordinated innovation. Williams carefully describes early efforts and
                    experiments and the inability of manufacturers to meet all these goals in a satisfactory manner,
                    concluding that "tractors did not reach a practical, mechanical maturity until the eve of
                    the Second World War" (p. 86).</p>
            <p>Once perfected, tractors had revolutionary effects on farming and on rural society. They increased
                    output while decreasing the drudgery of farm work, but at a cost as farmers became increasingly and
                    dangerously dependent on off-farm inputs such as credit, fuel, and maintenance. Expenditures for
                    such services and products seemed wise when incurred during good times but proved disastrous when
                    farm commodity prices declined. Williams concludes, however, that much of the resulting social
                    disruption could have been avoided and current trends might still be reversed. Mistaken social
                    policy, not technology, is destroying the "moderate-sized" family farm, he
                    insists: "tractors and other machinery are but scapegoats for a society that has never been
                    able to address the unconscious centralization of economic power into ever fewer, but ever bigger,
                    heedless corporations" (p. 186). Many will surely disagree, and some will undoubtedly
                    wonder how big a moderate-sized farm should be. But all should ponder Williams'S arguments
                    as they learn from his well-written history.</p>
