                    efforts had been noble and necessary. But in the early Twenties doubts began to appear, and in the
                    succeeding years they came to view their part in that war in a more cynical light. Shocked at what
                    they read in the "Now It Can Be Told" exposures, many declared that the country
                    had been caught in a diabolically clever web woven by British propagandists.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> By

                    </placeName> became a belligerent in order to insure the continuance of a foreign loan-fed war

                    </placeName> had gone to war to protect the loans of international bankers, and another school

                    interpretations was accepted, the average individual was placed in the unhappy and uncomplimentary
                    role of a dupe. The only compensating thought for him was that if he had been tricked into war then
                    the responsibility for that war was not his.</p>
            <p>Another <hi rend="i">zeitgeist</hi> has come around, however, and a reevaluation of the cause of
                    American action in 1917 has begun. It is too soon to predict whether this movement will stop at
                    correcting the over simplification and dogmatism of the previous period or will return to the
                    earlier excessive romanticism and chauvinism. Whatever its ultimate fate, the new spirit has already
                    performed one service by placing a large share of the responsibility for participation in the World
                    War on the general public. If that participation was wise the mass of citizens of 1914 to 1917
                    deserve much of the credit; if it was a grievous mistake they must shoulder a corresponding portion
                    of the blame. In the following pages an attempt is made to trace the attitudes of a somewhat typical
                    group of Middle Westerners through the early months of the War.</p>
            <p>The fateful assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand at Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, attracted
                    erable attention throughout Indiana. But no extraordinary significance was attached to the event,
                    and it was generally regarded as just another murder of a foreign aristrocrat. By the third day the
                    news was shifted to an inside page of the papers and by July 4 disappeared entirely, to remain so
                    for three weeks. Therefore, the Austrian ultimatum of July 23 came as a surprise and caught the
                    public mentally unprepared for the subsequent developments.</p>
            <p>War followed with a rush, and as it leaped from country to country, the Middle Westerners watched its
                    progress in hypnotized horror. Beyond doubt, the first major reaction toward the European strife was
                    one of deep shock that such things could be. Some called it Armageddon while others used
                    Sherman's pithy definition, but practically all agreed <list type="footnotes">

                    … could in the wildest delirium have dreamed that such a crime against God and man was

            </p>
            <p>The war was real enough, however, and some explanation had to be found for the anachronistic
                    happenings. From all parts of the state and from all classes came the simultaneous
                    response—the institution of monarchy with its attendant militarism and secret diplomacy
                    is the culprit. With virtual unanimity it was asserted that the war had not been willed by the
                    people but by their rulers in pursuance of personal policies of revenge or ambition, and that the
                    public went unwillingly to battle or with an enthusiasm which they had been tricked and trained into
                    adopting by present slogans and past schooling.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> It was felt that, whereas the
                    souls of emperors and commoners were cast in the same mold, the reasons that made for wrangles
                    between neighbors caused war between princes. But in the latter case, though it was a
                    King's war, it was a peasant's fight. Therein lay the rub. It was a
                    shame—practically every vocal Hoosier vowed—that the rulers couldn't
                    be made to fight their own battles and break their own heads. "Chic" Jackson left

            <p>This overly simplified view as to the cause of the war was in the prevailing spirit of optimism, for
                    it presumed the essential goodness and perfectibility of the mass of mankind and sheered away from
                    all hints that war might be the incurable result of <hi rend="i">homo sapiens'</hi>
                    inherent moral and mental deficiencies. Furthermore, to put so much guilt on monarchy was to praise
                    democracy, and a wave of democratic testifying swept the land.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> A rediscovery
                    of the merits of popular government was made, and much that had come to be taken for granted was
                    clothed with new meaning. Platitudes came to life, and copy book phrases became fighting phrases.
                    Struck by the spirited criticism directed at the reigning monarchs, one observer wrote,
                    "Over night our people have revived all the revolt against the throne which inspired so
                    avidly our war of independence. Even the old phrases of revolutionary days are heard on tongues that
                    have known them only in school books. The man in the street is voicing [pledges to
                    democracy]…. They come in the newspapers in every mail. They compose the one clear and
                    strong reaction from the war."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Allied to this resurgence of democracy was a temporary sharp reaction against militarism and
                    "jingoism" at home and abroad. The European strife was widely accepted as proof
                    that large military establishments were detrimental to peace, and former advocates of such in
                    America found themselves severely criticized. "Watchful Waiting" and
                    "grape-juice diplomacy" were probably more popular during this August than at any
                    previous or future time, and the Democrats hastened to compare Wilson's patience toward
                    Mexico with the precipitate action of various European chancellories.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>To these reactions can be added still another. From the time the Austrian ultimatum was first
                    announced the majority of the people of Indiana gave their sympathy to the Entente powers. There
                    were two outstanding and clearly distinguishable reasons for this attitude. The first was the nature
                    of the governments of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="au">Austria</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, or at least the local conception of them. The result of the newly accentuated affinity
                    for democracy and antipathy for autocrats described on previous pages created a deep antagonism
                    toward the Central Powers and good will for the Entente nations, Russia excepted. It would have been
                    unnatural and a cause for alarm regarding the virility of the American democratic spirit if it had
                    been otherwise. As a <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Daily Times</hi> explained that the strong American sentiment against <placeName>

                    </placeName> was "not against the German people or their cause, but because the Kaiser and
                    his royal authority are so foreign to American institutions. The fact that <placeName>

                    these governments nearer our own form. That this creates a bond of sympathy is evidenced by the fact
                    that there is no sentiment in this country in favor of Russia and its autocratic

                    itself in periodic saber rattling and a general chip-on-the-shoulder attitude. "Prussian
                    Militarism" and its leader and prototype, Kaiser Wilhelm, came in for special criticism.
                    With his spiked helmet, army cloak, upturned mustache, sword, boots, spurs, and grim visage, the
                    Kaiser became the living incarnation of the American conception of a Prussian War Lord. And worse
                    yet, as one Methodist minister told his flock, many were convinced that he had "a
                    pronounced degree of insanity."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> His considerable ability was never
                    appreciated in America, and he was known largely for his bombastic warlike utterances and his
                    ostentatious manner of addressing God. The latter point was subject to particular censure in
                    evangelistic Indiana, and there is no more striking example of the resourcefulness of German
                    diplomatic inaptitude than the ability of the Protestant Kaiser to alienate Protestant America by
                    his method of calling on God. In brief, the toast "Hoch! Der Kaiser!" carried
                    approximately the same connotation to that more sensitive generation that "Heil
                    Hitler!" did to a later one. A derogatory poem with this toast as its title was much quoted
                    at the time, the opening stanza of which will serve to indicate its nature. <quote rend="blockquote">

                    clear by a chronological summary of events. The Dual Monarchy, on June 28, had dissolved one aspect
                    of the diplomatic crisis by a declaration of war on Serbia. The local response was instantaneous and

                    yet been materially felt. In the main, these first reactions had been undirected and spontaneous
                    individual expressions of belief made by Americans emotionally moved. The brusqueness of German
                    diplomacy, so fatally demonstrated by the "scrap of paper" statement, was putting
                    her case in the worst possible light.</p>
            <p>Before leaving this first crest of anti-German feeling, it should be noted that there was no
                    discernible demand that anything be done about it. For all the sympathy for <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName>, there was no suggestion that America join in her protection. Nor did the public expect
                    to be compelled to fight by reason of a direct challenge by one of the combatants, or be drawn in by
                    forces beyond their control, for that age did not recognize any such forces. The vast majority never
                    doubted but that they could will war or peace. They expected to live "strictly and

                    such times, and watch the big show from an unexposed position. Perhaps these attitudes were in part

                    </placeName> would be defeated<hi rend="sup">27</hi> and (2) the conflict would be short. As to the
                    latter, modern warfare was expected to be so expensive and voracious that it must come to an early

                    anti-German feeling moderated considerably. From July 24 to August 5 each event had appeared to
                    result solely from the preceding one. But as the crisis receded there was a tendency to dismiss the
                    details and say that the war was a test of strength between the Triple Alliance and the Triple
                    Entente—that and nothing more. Furthermore, German-Americans, Hungarians, and Irish

                    hesitant opinion demonstrated that the bulk of the people were not hopelessly turned toward one side
                    and that their sympathy would depend largely on the course of events.</p>
            <p>But this pro-German swing of public opinion which had begun about the middle of August proved to be
                    only an interlude. The closing days of that month saw a re-assertion of sympathy for the Allies. It
                    became stabilized by September somewhere below the high partisanship of the first week of the war
                    and above the low of the third week of August. At least four factors played' a part in this
                    change of sentiment: (1) unpopular Russia and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> dropped into the background, (2) censorship and colored news accounts favored the
                    Allies, (3) German propaganda was ineffectual, and (4) the German campaign in <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName> stirred the emotions. The last three warrant elaboration.</p>
            <p>Since the cutting of the German cables on August 5, virtually all news of events was communicated to
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> over the English cables and was subject to censorship. Consequently, an open-minded
                    person reading his daily paper tended to become pro-Ally. English efforts were all the more
                    effective, for the most part, because they were unobtrusive and thereby contrasted favorably with
                    the frontal assault of the German propaganda offerings that reached America. The newly rich and
                    newly powerful German Empire had many of the unpleasant characteristics generally associated with

                    </placeName>. In this case, as was true of most major developments during the war, it was the impact

                    distrustful of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> that was the determining factor. Atrocity stories manufactured from whole cloth had
                    comparatively little effect on the public and were, as a matter of act, far less numerous at this
                    period than is generally remembered. It is true that reports of "boys with both their hands
                    cut off, so that it was impossible for them to carry a gun," of "firing on Red
                    Cross nurses," of "women raped," of "mutilations and killing of
                    the wounded," of "dumdum bullets," etc., were scattered through the
                    papers of the fall and winter of 1914, but apparently their chief effect was to heighten the blood
                    pressure of those who were already irretrievably and intensely pro-Ally. Certain it is that they
                    were discounted editorially by the local editors as not "to be taken with so much as a
                    grain of salt,"<hi rend="sup">35</hi> and if there was a single "artist's
                    conception" of one of these stories in a newspaper in Indiana during 1914, the present
                    writer failed to find it.</p>
            <p>Whatever the exact influence of the fictitious atrocity tales may have been, there can be no doubt of
                    the far-reaching effect of actual occurrences in <placeName>

                    destruction of the World War was much greater than the wars that preceded it. Consequently, when the

                    destruction in so short a time. A land was laid waste and a people scattered in less than a month.
                    Refugees poure along the roads in advance of the German flood, and shattered villages emerged in its
                    wake. In the Indiana papers appeared pictures of Belgian refugee families wearily plodding along
                    crowded roads and of shattered buildings resembling Roman ruins that had been fifteen hundred years
                    in the making. These were the "atrocity" pictures that moved the people in 1914.

                    would not have been stirred. But no part of this was true, and it was natural that compassion should

                    damages on its own scant territory. Moreover the stubborn fighting of her soldiers and the effective

               <hi rend="sup">37</hi> In view of this sentiment it was a mistake for
                    German propagandists to seek to counteract growing partisanship for the Allies by a campaign of
                    vilification of <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Thus far, attempts to weigh the influence of the Belgian campaign on Indiana opinion have been
                    confined chiefly to fictional atrocity stories and to inevitable war-time destruction. But there
                    were other German actions that fell in the twilight zone between the legal and the illegal and were
                    more difficult of classification. Furthermore, the answer to the long-standing debate as to whether <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> did or did not commit "atrocities" in <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName> depends largely on how these particular actions are defined. The German government
                    considered them to be legally and morally justified and performed them openly; the people of Indiana
                    classed them as atrocities and were shocked at their occurrence.</p>
            <p>Among the most important of these border line cases was the German practice of levying tribute on
                    captured towns and provinces to help defray the cost of occupation. Prosperous Brussels, an open
                    city which had not offered military resistance, was taxed forty million dollars and the smaller
                    cities accordingly. Although James G. McDonald of the department of history of Indiana University
                    justified the levy as a moral and humane method of assessment on a conquered enemy,<hi rend="sup">38</hi> the public felt that <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName> did not deserve to be treated as a conquered enemy and did not hesitate to assail this
                    action as atrocious. Convinced that <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>

                    remembered that the Germans were seeking to collect these levies at the very time that the neutral
                    world was being called upon to sustain life in <placeName>

                    </placeName> by a gratuitous relief program.</p>
            <p>Other events which the Germans regarded as permissible and the Hoosiers looked upon as atrocities
                    were the bombings and shellings of cities in <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The use of the Zeppelin for this purpose was especially obnoxious, and these long,
                    lean monsters of the air became the epitome of sinister frightfulness. In all probability, the
                    Germans sought to confine their attacks to legitimate military objectives, but because of the nature
                    of the weapon the noncombatants usually suffered more than the target. "It is bad enough
                    that men must face bullets and cold steel and that fortified cities must be shelled to reduce the
                    fortifications, but it is unspeakably shocking that women and children, wounded and noncombatants in
                    the heart of a city should be subjected to bombardment from the sky,"<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
                    ran a typical editorial.</p>
            <p>Still another German practice that was generally regarded as reprehensible was the severity with
                    which the Belgian civilian population was punished because some of its members took part in the
                    fighting. The Germans, in a desperate hurry to conquer and pacify <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName> and angered at what they considered to be nefarious attacks, struck out savagely
                    against all civilian war activity. Numerous municipalities were in part or wholly destroyed and many
                    of their leading officials and citizens executed because civilian snipers fired on German troops.
                    The university city of Louvain was handled with an especial roughness, as an example to the rest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName>, that left the vital parts of the city in charred ruins and many of its inhabitants
                    dead. The Indiana public, violently disapproved of these "sample" burnings and
                    killings, feeling that the Germans had carried their reprisals to excess. One contemporary mirrored
                    the common attitude when he stated, "Even if the non-combatants, driven to desperation, had
                    fired on the enemy, the most drastic punishment <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> in regard to the civilian sniper. In the eyes of the military-bred German the
                    civilian-soldier was a despicable military private and outlaw who was acting contrary to the rules
                    of the game. Whereas in the non-military (but warlike) <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> the citizen-soldier was a person of honor and respect. Part of the success of the
                    American war of independence had been due to the work of just such non-professional fighters as
                    those that the Germans were executing. For these reasons, the American civilians regarded the
                    warring Belgian civilians as heroes who had taken up arms in defense of their country. Many a
                    Hoosier who had gone squirrel hunting, patronized the shooting galleries, or dreamed of playing the
                    hero must have pictured himself with a gun lying in wait for German Uhlans.</p>
            <p>An anti-German influence of a different nature that grew out of the Belgian campaign was the two
                    month relief program that was launched about the middle of October. The managers of the drive
                    understood that the extent to which a donor would reach into his pocket depended to a large degree
                    on the depth of his emotions. Therefore, the appeal for funds was so pitched as to highlight <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName>'s plight and to personalize and individualize the sufferers. As a result, each
                    dollar or sack of flour donated and each comforter or pair of socks knit for the "starving
                    Belgians" was likely to be a bond that bound the giver to <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName> and its allies. The partisan effect of donating toys to help fill a Christmas Ship for <placeName>

            <p>To summarize: the Belgian news of anti-German influence can be classified as (1) fictitious atrocity
                    stories which were believed by those who were already anti-German, (2) inevitable wartime
                    destruction which made for Belgian sympathy because it was felt that she was but an innocent

                    Actions that their children would regard as mild aroused them to protestations and moralistic
                    indignation. German national psychology and administrative efficiency had been more responsible than
                    any intent to be malicious, but the result was to some extent the same, and the consequent effect on
                    American opinion can scarcely be exaggerated. The strategy which the German General Staff had felt

            <p>Thus, the Central Powers had come to be rather generally regarded as illiberal and militaristic. This
                    being the case, it was unfortunate, from the standpoint of neutral opinion, that their first ally
                    should have been the "terrible Turk," whose reported treatment of Christian
                    Armenians had made its name synonymous with barbarism in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Turkey's choice of partners seemed to confirm the impression that one side in
                    the war was the side of autocracy. Furthermore, the religious element had been added, and
                    restoration of Christian rule in the Holy Land appeared to depend on the defeat of the Central
                    Powers. It was no accident that when the comic strip characters, Mutt and Jeff, went to war they
                    killed only Turks.</p>
            <p>Nineteen hundred fourteen was an election year, and for a time the war dropped into the background as
                    all Indiana played the "election game." The European strife was generally ignored
                    by all parties because it contained too much unpredictable dynamite and because there was little
                    discernible difference in the position of Democrats, Republicans, and Progressives on this matter.
                    No party considered that there had been, or was likely to be, any danger of the <placeName>

                    come in 1916.</p>
            <p>The shock of the European war had temporarily strengthened the peace sentiment in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and the Democrats sought to convert this reaction into votes by pointing out that if
                    the Administration had been as warlike toward Mexico as its critics had wished, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would be at war with that country, and the Western Hemisphere would be like the
                    Eastern. William Jennings Bryan stressed this point in a two-day speaking tour of the state, and
                    Democrat orators, with Mexico in mind, exclaimed "War in the East, Peace in the
                    West—Thank God for Wilson."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> The Republicans campaigned, in
                    the words of Will H. Hays, for "a protective tariff and lower taxes." The European
                    war did not play a significant part in their efforts, but two minor developments were of some
                    importance as presaging Republican strategy in 1916. Former Vice-President Charles W. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>As this singular year came to an end, local opinion toward the war could be analyzed somewhat as
                    follows: not less than two-thirds and not more than three-fourths of the people were clearly
                    pro-Ally in sentiment. Many New Year's celebrations resounded to the tune of
                    "Tipperary" set to dance time, and a joke going the rounds proclaimed,

                    thought of war because there was very little love for <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> and Russia. Moreover, antagonism toward <placeName>

                    </placeName> was still almost entirely on an altruistic basis. The nationalistic chord had not been

                    divisions were not as pronounced or significant in Indiana a.s in many of the states. Class
                    consciousness scarcely existed; foreign groups were small; cities were of moderate size; rural and
                    urban population was almost equally balanced: Middle West culture patterns prevailed. The result was

            <p>The largest and most influential minority racial group was the German, and the first news of trouble
                    in Europe had brought its members rallying to the cause of the homeland. Practically as a unit they
                    accepted and vigorously as a matter-of-fact defended the official German theses. There was some
                    deviation, but it was so slight that the citizen of 1914 could assume with virtual certainty that

                    last development of 1914 to which the local Germans gave special attention was the British violation
                    of neutral rights on the sea. Throughout the first six months of the war the only serious
                    interference to American sea-borne trade was by the Allies, and every German-American spokesman

                    </placeName> were parallel, and a German victory would be to America's advantage.</p>
            <p>Passing from a discussion of specific developments to general aims, all major activity of the
                    German-Americans can be ascribed to one of four objectives. First, they sought to secure sympathy
                    for <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and animosity toward her enemies by explaining her version of the war and by
                    emphasizing all unneutral action, real and potential, of the Allies. A second objective was the
                    raising of relief funds for use in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, and the extravagantly generous response to this call made all other war relief efforts
                    seem chary. The individual donations of $5,000 to the "League of 1914"
                    and the liberal response to the "Gold für Eisen" campaign demonstrated
                    that the much talked of love for the Fatherland was clearly more than sound and foam. A third aim
                    was to prevent the floating of war loans in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. Yet German-American papers advertised and German-American banks bought German war
                    securities, particularly in the first two years.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> The fourth aim was the
                    securing of an American embargo on munition shipments to the warring powers. This, in fact, was the
                    most energetically pursued aim—the grand goal—of all German-American activity.
                    The more sanguine went so far as to press for a similar embargo on food.</p>
            <p>That these aims were not attained was due to a number of reasons, most of them outside the control of
                    the local German coterie. Yet it is evident from the vantage point of a later generation that some
                    of the responsibility for failure must be borne on their own shoulders, for, as Carl Wittke has
                    cautiously pointed out, "they occasionally overstepped the bounds of discretion and common
                    sense" in their zeal to defend their beliefs.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> The German apologists
                    handicapped themselves and hurt their cause by the raucous manner in which they too often presented
                    their case. They were dogmatic and at times abusive in their arguments, and as though trying to
                    compensate for their fewer numbers they were vociferous to the extreme. Moreover, their words were

                    internal unity was thus obtained there was little to attract the outsider. In fact, their arguments
                    in too many cases were not so much designed to convert opponents as to hold them to derisive
                    ridicule, and an opponent who has been made angry is a difficult person to convince. The successful

                    excellent, e.g., "A professor in an American college is never content until he gets a Ph.D.

                    between the German word, <hi rend="i">Kultur</hi> (all aspects of German life, military, scientific,
                    etc.), and the English word, culture (the humanities). Assuming the two words to be identical many

                    or ended with references to German military efficiency and might. Consequently, it was sometimes

                    </placeName> had already won the war, and the fawning adulation which they bestowed on the Kaiser
                    was almost nauseating to the uninitiated.</p>
            <p>The war tended to draw those of German descent closer to one another and to set them apart from their
                    neighbors. They came to be regarded, and to regard themselves, as a community within a community
                    having a set of interests peculiar to themselves. Their criticisms of the non-Germans sometimes
                    passed the limits of prudence, and a few of their more vociferous members fell into the habit of
                    criticizing all American action, relevant and irrelevant, domestic and foreign. In such
                    circumstances it is not surprising that some should challenge the loyalty of those of German descent
                    and accuse them of having interests foreign to the rest of the country. They were charged with being
                    more German than American or at best of being part one and part the other—of being
                    literally German-Americans. Before the war was a month old anti-"hyphenate"
                    sentiment and voices appeared locally, and there was much shaking of heads and muttering that
                    "if they don't like it here why don't they go back to <placeName>

            <p>By keeping in mind this division between the "Deutsch-Americaner" and the remainder
                    of the people it becomes possible to understand why the public was so conscious and disapproving of
                    official German propaganda. The propaganda of the German government was directed chiefly to the
                    German element in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and it sought to persuade them to take a position different from that held by most
                    Americans and for the advantage of a foreign power. It appeared, therefore, to be an appeal for a
                    divided loyalty and a divided country. Consequently, it took on a sinister aspect and, as Johann von
                    Bernstorff noted, the words "German propagandist" early became "a term of

                    disseminations, much more plentiful and more likely to pull the country from its peace moorings,
                    were addressed to the general public. They agreed with the preconceived views of most of the
                    population, and were not intrusive, Therefore, the people were but little conscious of them, and the
                    German efforts received most of the publicity and acrimony.</p>
            <p>To their detriment those of German descent said too little concerning the softer and less warlike
                    facets of German civilization. The high standard of living, absence of slums, conservation, lack of
                    lawlessness, scientific and educational standards, old age insurance, and other such German
                    achievements might well have received greater stress. Turner societies, German cooking, German
                    Christmas, comradery of hikes, and other aspects of "Gemütlichkeit"
                    should have been recounted. There was much that could have been said for the "German
                    Way" but the German-Americans said very little of it. Furthermore, less bombastic optimism
                    would have helped the German standing, because the American people have generally felt that in some
                    way the under-dog is a pretty good dog. All in all, if the Indiana public was inclined to view <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> as glorying in militarism and autocracy, the local Germans were partly to blame.</p>
            <p>Second in importance to the Germans among the "foreign" groups were the Irish, and
                    they too desired a victory for the Central Powers. Such an eventuality, it was hoped, would provide <placeName>

                    Britain as the champion of small nations.</p>
            <p>Like the Germans, the Irish favored strong retaliatory measures against English obstruction of
                    American sea traffic, magnified the "Yellow Peril," worked to prevent the sale of
                    Allied war bonds in America, and pressed for embargoes on arms and food. They repetitiously asserted

            <p>The Irish pleas were better received in Indiana than were the German-American because they harmonized

                    English, and because most Hoosiers felt that the Irish had cause for complaint. But like many other
                    groups, the Irish sometimes let their sympathies run away with their judgment, and at such times
                    their language became violent or gibing and their accusations against <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> passed beyond the bounds of logic. Furthermore, their solicitude for mistreated <placeName>

                    "genuine neutrality," they were more partisan and less compromising than those
                    whom they criticized. Subsequent events have tended to obscure the fact that the first demands that

                    first) generation immigrants who were still closely attached to the "Old Country,"
                    their patriotism remained very much alive. Therefore, they viewed the war with an intensity of

                    because they possessed no home and were not entirely convinced as to where their best interests lay

                    the Allies and repudiated any claim of the Hapsburgs to their services or sympathy. The Austrian
                    Serbs, Croatians, Rumanians, and Czechs rejoiced at each Allied victory and remained stubbornly and
                    suspiciously aloof from efforts to woo them from that position.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> The Austrian

            <p>The most numerous and influential group in Indiana consisted of those persons who were rather vaguely
                    designated as the "Old Stock" and apparently included all whose ancestors had been

                    </placeName> more than two generations. They were convinced that <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> had started the war, they disliked German militarism, and they hoped for an Allied
                    victory. But more than partisanship for one foreign power over another would be necessary before
                    they would desire war, for they were inclined to believe that "Europe has always fought and
                    always will." They were a sentimental people, for it was they who raised the Belgian relief
                    funds. Yet their sentimentality was not without a governor, and they would not permit their sympathy
                    for the "starving Belgians" and the "butchered Armenians" to
                    involve them in armed conflict. They had been anti-English for a long time, and it would require
                    more propaganda skill than the British possessed to cause them to fight to save the British Empire.
                    Nor would they go to war to make the world safe for democracy. For although the Middle West
                    "Old Stock" were staunch advocates of democracy, and although this trait was
                    partly responsible for their being anti-German, they were not actively interested in an <hi rend="i">International</hi> for the spread of democracy abroad. Theirs was an American Democracy, a
                    fundamental part of their nationalism, and not primarily an international ideology. In short, the
                    later popular picture of Hoosiers being carried away by sentimentality, by English propaganda, by an
                    ideological crusade, by munition makers, and by international bankers to the point where they would
                    rush to war against the greatest military power in the world was drawn by those who had never known
                    these folk. These influences helped to make them pro-Ally, but a different propulsion would be
                    required to make them pro-war. They had their feet surprisingly firm on the ground, so firm in fact
                    that visitors from the eastern states were sometimes so shocked at the locals' failure to
                    "comprehend the deeper issues involved" that they almost despaired of the
                    republic.</p>
            <p>There was., however, one motivation that would move them to take up arms against a foreign power, and
                    that was nationalism. For old-fashioned, fervent patriotism inspired <pb n="336" id="VAA4025-037-4-032"/> by a feeling of righteous indignation at the action of some power that
                    was challenging or defying the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> they would shoulder arms. It was necessary that the nationalistic element be added to
                    the other factors before Indiana and the Middle West would favor war, but once that condition was
                    met divisions would be put aside and unity quickly achieved. This nationalism, however, would not be
                    fired by loss of property nor by theoretical principles of international law but would require loss
                    of life or what would be considered a direct challenge to the nation.</p>
            <p>In the early days of the war, ministerial interpretation generally agreed with the rest of the
                    citizens that the fighting was the result of autocracy. They placed, however, more emphasis on large
                    armaments as a contributing cause than did their parishioners, and in some instances they said that
                    the conflict was due to the "presence of sin and rebellion in God's
                        world,"<hi rend="sup">80</hi> or that it was "the Lord's means of
                    chastising the nations"<hi rend="sup">81</hi> or that, although "God moves in
                    mysterious ways his wonders to perform," He was using the war to achieve some great end
                    that would be manifest in time,<hi rend="sup">82</hi> or that it was merely the fulfillment of
                    prophecy and would lead to the Millenium and the second coming of Christ.<hi rend="sup">83</hi>
                    Being the incurable optimists that they were, the clergy stressed the possibility that the terrible
                    war might result in such benefits as a general realization of the futility of war, new brotherhood
                    of man, and the return to the sanctums of religion by a chastised world.</p>
            <p>Lutherans, (German) Catholics, the German Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the

                    religious phraseology. The Lutherans in particular gave valuable support to the German cause. Their

            <p>Whether a member of the Catholic Church found logic in the Allied or German arguments depended
                    primarily on the racial group to which he belonged, for there would be obvious differences in
                    sentiment among the Belgian, Irish, German, Polish, Italian and Hungarian faithful. To the extent
                    that the Church favored one side over another it leaned toward the Central Powers. The Church
                    periodical, <hi rend="i">Our Sunday Visitor,</hi> was neutral. But the <hi rend="i">Indiana

                    articles without balancing them with Allied ones. Not a single openly pro-Ally Church paper reached
                    Indiana in sizable numbers. One reason for this pro-German tendency was that the Irish ranked first
                    in Church leadership and the Germans second. Another was the fact that <placeName>

            <p>Neither the Lutherans nor Catholics classed all war as sinful, but there were five churches, possibly
                    more, in Indiana which officially and consistently denounced war as being outside the borders of
                    Christianity. They refused to choose sides in the conflict, at least publicly. They stood out
                    solidly against American sale of munitions abroad, opposed efforts to increase the American army and
                    navy, and their young men refused to do combatant service in the army. These were the Friends
                    (Quakers), Church of the Brethren (Dunkard), Mennonite, Amish, and Seventh Day Adventists,<hi rend="sup">90</hi> all relatively strong in Indiana. Other churches which denounced war with
                    particular emphasis but did not carry their opposition to this point included the Free Methodist,
                    Pilgrim Holiness, Church of God, Nazarene, and, widely different from the others, the Unitarian. The
                    Christian Scientists also stressed peace on every possible occasion, but unlike some of the others
                    they were clearly, but reservedly, pro-Ally.</p>
            <p>The Episcopal Church which played an important role in the eastern and southern portions of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was comparatively weak in the Middle West, having but slightly more than 8,000
                    communicants in the whole of Indiana. To virtually the last member they were for <placeName>

                    failure to see the great issues involved and lamented the tendency in some quarters to regard the
                    war as "no more than a dog fight in the street." "In the east the
                    conscience of the people seems to be more outspoken—whether you believe they speak out
                    rightly or wrongly—but here it is silent; here we seem to have mistaken moral
                    indifference for political neutrality. We must do nothing, we must say nothing…. A good
                    deal of our neutrality, so-called, and a good deal of our so-called pacifism seems to be no more
                    than moral obtuseness and cowardice."<hi rend="sup">91</hi> Quite clearly the <list type="footnotes">

                    however, were not of recent immigrant stock and did not refer to themselves as German-Americans. The
                    result seems to have been that a majority were pro-Ally but that enough German consciousness
                    remained to cause a few of them to be pro-German and others to be indifferent.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>
                    Their attitude toward the preparedness movement was never clearly defined, but Bishop H. H. Fout was
                    more inclined to favor an increase in the army and navy than were many of his ministers.</p>
            <p>In each town and community there generally was to be found a Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, and
                    Christian (Disciples of Christ) church. They occupied the vast middle ground that lay between the
                    Holiness on one end and the Episcopalians on the other, and they were closely representative of the
                    state. They had numerous differences, chiefly traditional and inherited, but they agreed in favoring
                    an Allied victory.<hi rend="sup">93</hi> Furthermore, the ministers were likely to be more partisan
                    than were the lay members, because they possessed more of an emotional antipathy for
                    "Prussian Militarism" and "War Lord" sovereigns. Yet it would be
                    an error to picture these parsons, and those of other denominations, as shouldering arms each Sunday
                    in a crusade for a holy war. The apparent fruits of militarism abroad made them all the more firmly
                    opposed to it at home, and for the first year of the war they adamantly opposed all proposals for
                    major increases in the army and navy (Baptists and Christians were more anti-preparedness than were
                    the Methodists and Presbyterians). It is true that they later fell in line with this program, but
                    (speeches of a few fire eaters to the contrary) they were following and not leading. Their <list type="footnotes">

                    leading to conflict helped make war possible, but they were not war hawks.</p>
            <p>In the political field, in contrast to the religious, notable differences did not exist between the
                    two major parties during 1914 and 1915. An exception was the question of preparedness, which was
                    championed more vigorously by the Republicans than by the Democrats. The parties most directly
                    concerned by the war in its early stages were the Progressive (Bull Mocse) and the Socialist, and
                    for both it was a seriously disruptive force.</p>
            <p>The Progressives were already ailing by the summer of 1914, but the war materially hastened their
                    end. For one thing, the biggest Bull Moose of them all, Theodore Roosevelt, was strongly
                    anti-German, and the result was an alienation of affection between the leader and party members who
                    were of German blood, a large contingent. Furthermore, the impact of war separated the pacifist and
                    internationalist section of the party, such as Jane Addams, from the "red-blooded"
                    and nationalist faction which controlled most of the party press. The fight over the preparedness
                    movement between these two groups was particularly bitter, because the pacifists saw in the war a
                    gruesome object lesson of the inevitable result of large armies, whereas the nationalists contended
                    that the one major lesson that the conflict offered America was the need for large military forces
                    for protection against aggressors. So deep and wide grew this schism that it is difficult to see how
                    they could have joined forces again under the old leaders.</p>
            <p>The first reaction of the Socialists had been a unanimous denunciation of the conflict as one that
                    would be fought by the workers for the benefit of their exploiters. But this initial unity soon
                    dissolved as many of the members came to feel that there was a difference in degree between the
                    combatants, and as the arms embargo question divided the party into two camps. There were two
                    things, however, on which virtually all Socialists did agree. The first was their last ditch
                    opposition to the American preparedness campaign, and the second was an insistence that the <placeName>

                    </placeName> should not permit its controversies with the belligerents to end in war.</p>
            <p>While professing moral shock at the war every major <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-037-4-037"/> economic
                    group in the state became optimistic over its dollar and cents effect, a result that was doubly
                    welcomed because 1914 was a depression year. On August 8 the <hi rend="i">Farmer's
                    Guide</hi> predicted agricultural prosperity and noted that "In one day ninety millions of
                    dollars were added to the value of the wheat held by farmers in this country."<hi rend="sup">94</hi> Labor anticipated more and superior jobs, and business men hopefully awaited
                    better times. "Even th' loafer is figurin' on bein' benefited by
                    th' European War," Abe Martin observed."<hi rend="sup">95</hi> Trade with
                    Europe.was expected to boom, and the American opportunity in South America was likened to that of a
                    merchant whose competitors had "burned down in one night."<hi rend="sup">96</hi>
                    War also was expected to eliminate importing rivals from the domestic market, and a "Made
                    in America" campaign was launched to educate the public on the superior qualities of
                    American wines, dyes, toys, dishes, and numerous other items. If, asserted the business men, the
                    government would only refrain from further socialistic, Wilsonian legislation that was impairing
                    confidence and "making private enterprise timid"<hi rend="sup">97</hi> the war
                    would pull the country out of the depression.</p>
            <p>When an attempt is made to differentiate between the war sympathies and reactions of those in
                    different occupations and on various economic levels serious difficulty is encountered because
                    regardless of the size of their income most of the Hoosiers insisted upon thinking of themselves as
                    middle-class. But if hard and fast divisions must be eschewed, a few tendencies and inclinations can
                    be recorded. Those in the middle income group and above were more vocally pro-Ally than were the
                    others. The farmers were less moved by the war than were the city dwellers and the laborers less
                    than their employers. Yet it would be a gross misapprehension to assume from this that the merchants
                    and industrialists were seeking war. They were immersed in their purchases and sales, were not
                    convinced that the <placeName>

                    to respond to "world saving" appeals. Only on one score were they taking the lead

                    preparedness movement. Their desire, however, for an increased army represented a state of mind and
                    not the presence of a plan for its use abroad. The farmers and laborers were in agreement in their
                    opposition to any far reaching armament program, but economically each thought the other was seeking
                    to profit unduly from the war by high prices or high wages. Organized labor was slightly less
                    pro-Ally than were the rest of the workers due to its intense aversion to labor-baiting Russia, the
                    strength of the trade union movement in <placeName>

                    Tarkington who wrote in 1915 that, "I begin to shake, shriek, and dribble at the mouth

                    societies, who likewise were strongly pro-Ally despite the historical distrust of Britain held by
                    some of them. It should be noted that those who would reap the greatest economic profit from <placeName>

            <p>This analysis of sentiment in 1914 reveals an initial pro-Ally sympathy at the outbreak of the war.
                    In the last half of August, however, hesitation, confusion, and doubts lessened this sympathy. This
                    was followed by a stabilization of sentiment during September that was pro-Ally but not
                    overwhelmingly so, and by the end of the year from two-thirds to three-fourths of the people seemed
                    to favor the Allies. This crystalization of attitude was produced by the partiality of Middle
                    Westerners for democratic methods, opposition to militarism, the superior effectiveness of English

                    the Catholics were divided. Politicians were much alike regardless of party lines, but the
                    Socialists were vigorously opposed to preparedness and involvement in the war. Generally the
                    professional classes were less opposed to American entrance than were businessmen, laborers, or the
                    farmers. The last two were more opposed than businessmen, but economic profits were not the key to
                    the development of sentiment in favor of aiding the Allies.</p>

            <p>Obscured by the brilliance of his triple career as a naturalist, teacher, and "minor prophet

                    </placeName>'s talent as a creative literary artist has not been adequately appreciated. As
                    a scientist he was the author of several hundred coldly factual monographs on ichthyology, and was
                    chosen president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; as a professor and
                    university president he served for thirty-seven years at Indiana and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and acted as chairman of the National Education Association; and as a worker for world
                    peace he was internationally known as a lecturer, dean of the American section of the Hague Peace
                    Conference in 1913, and recipient of a $25,000 peace prize. But in the realm of creative
                    literature Jordan also had ability and versatility not generally recognized. Not only a clever
                    versifier and disarmingly human autobiographer, he belonged, as a nature-essayist, to the worthy
                    school of John J. Audubon, Henry D. Thoreau, John Burroughs, and John Muir.</p>

            <p>Another of the very few references to his effectiveness and charm as a writer appeared in the early

                    </placeName> students, Bob was used as an animated biological specimen. At first afflicted with a
                    louse-like parasite, "Bob did not try to conceal this fact; he made it the joy of his
                    leisure." His reactions to snakes, salamanders, horses, coyote and wildcat skins, his
                    playmates Nanette and Mimi, and the Jordan family dog, all are skilfully and whimsically chronicled.
                    "Rover looked down on Bob with tolerant contempt, as a disagreeable being, not to be shaken
                    like a rat because possibly human." But eventually growing too short-tempered Bob was sent
                    back to his pet shop "where red-taïled parrots scold and swear." And

            <p>Appointed Chief Commissioner in charge of studying the fur-seal situation in Alaska and the Bering
                    Sea, Jordan with a number of governmental colleagues went to the Arctic Circle in the summer of
                    1896. There on the Pribilofs and the Komandorski Islands they discovered that the seal rookeries had
                    been literally decimated by illegal and inhumane pelagic slaughter of gravid females, whose pups on
                    shore likewise died as a result of starvation. Incensed by the avarice and cruelty of the

                            animal tale and, in its way, the best of its kind, each incident being drawn from actual
                            happenings (as vouched for in every case by photographs) and the local color being therefore
                            absolutely genuine …. "Matka" thus differs totally from the

            <p>Dexter was known as a staunch Union man and was hated by the Southern sympathizers for this reason.
                    The Stars and Stripes were ever flying at the jackstaff of the "Bowen." At one
                    time, on approaching Paducah, Dexter and Lemcke saw that the landing was packed with an excited mob,
                    some of whom were recognized as rabid Confederates. Shouts went up demanding that the Stars and
                    Stripes be lowered and that the boat be surrendered. As the boat landed several of the ring leaders
                    came forward to the edge of the wharfboat and reiterated their demands. Dexter coldly replied:
                    "Not as long as I have one shot left." He pointed to the cannon on the forecastle
                    where one of the crew stood with a burning fuse, and also to the brass nozzle of the hot water hose
                    in the hands of the engineer. "Lower it if you dare," he shouted. The boat then
                    pushed off for Cairo, leaving the mob somewhat awed.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>A group of Confederates at Owensboro fired on the flag of the "Sam Orr," as she was

                    Boys' "Dunbar," and while so engaged was seized at Paducah in retaliation
                    for the seizure of the "W. B. Terry," a few days previously by the gunboat "<placeName>

                    the <placeName>

                    little more about it, since the Fowlers had pledged their honor to him that no harm should overtake
                    the "Orr" while she ran in the "Dunbar's" place. When
                    in sight of Paducah he noticed that the landing and the wharf were crowded with people, which was
                    rather unusual; so he watched carefully, expecting if any evil designs were contemplated some of his

                    some of the officers of the "Terry," sprang on the lower deck of the
                    "Orr," one of whom was Whyte Fowler, who immediately ascended to the hurricane
                    deck where Captain McClurg was standing. Fowler then drew a pistol, cocked it, and leveled it at
                    McClurg's head, telling him that he was a prisoner. McClurg replied that he was unarmed and
                    could make no resistance, so he stepped down onto the wharfboat. Several shots were fired, one man
                    being injured. Fowler rang the bell, the boat shoved off, with the greater part of the
                    "Orr's" crew on board, and the Confederate crew gave three cheers for
                    Jeff Davis. The crew of the "Orr" was taken about a mile above Paducah and put
                    ashore, but they were not permitted to take their extra clothes and personal effects with them. The
                    mail which was on the boat and its cargo, which was valued at $25,000, were taken up the <placeName>

            <p>At this time the rebels began their depredations along Green River. Navigation was practically at a

                            when we arrived the water was rushing through the enlarged opening and spreading over the

                        <p>We entered the pass to the Coldwater, which is estimated to be about sixteen miles in length,
                            on Saturday afternoon, in company with the steamer "Alone." Our progress
                            that afternoon was one mile….</p>
                        <p>On Sunday morning we were under headway by seven o'clock. The water was swift and
                            rapidly rising. At times the boat would go crushing into the brush and timber on one side
                            and then her stern would swing around, sweeping away the brush and dead limbs on the other
                            side. At times there would be a shower of broken limbs and dead wood swept down by the
                            chimneys which would cover the hurricane roof.</p>
                        <p>Again the struggle between the chimneys and some obstinate limb would be so fiercely
                            contested as to leave the result for a time in doubt until the limb would finally give way
                            and come down with a crash that startled every passenger. There are few bends in the Pass.
                            The turns are very abrupt, forming either acute or right angles. Many of these turns can be
                            made only by sending a small boat in advance, with a line. Fastening one end of it to a
                            tree, the crew could pull the boat around to point with safety if not with ease. Thus did we
                            work our way slowly along, each day's experience being similar to the last.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday we passed the steamer "Luella" sunk. She was heavily loaded with
                            commissary stores, most of which were lost….</p>

                        <p>We arrived at Coldwater River on Monday, at 4 o'clock. It proved to be but a
                            repetition of the Pass in every particular…. Our boat was damaged more in the
                            Coldwater than in the Pass.</p>

                    If local steam-boating had not declined it is doubtful that Captain Henry T. Dexter, despite his

                    old government warehouse near Robert Barnes' residence, was razed; the gunboat
                    "Lou Eaves" sold to private interests, as was the government wharfboat. The cannon
                    which had seen service on the forecastle of the "Charley Bowen," was installed as
                    a hitching post at Captain Dexter's residence, and now the Captain could give his exclusive
                    time to fast steamboats and fast horses.</p>

            <p>An interesting proposal is being considered by the Executive Committee of the Indiana Historical
                    Society and by others with reference to the more effective development of historical writing. The
                    proposal is that the educational institutions of the state and the county historical societies join
                    in an effort to get an adequate history of every county in the state and to have it published before
                    the sesquicentennial of Indiana's admission into the Union. If the year 1966 seems too
                    remote for such consideration, it may be looked upon as the latest date at which the last straggler
                    should be brought to time, and not the date for progressive counties to set.</p>
            <p>County histories in the past have had a dubious reputation. Many of them were published as money
                    making commercial enterprises and little regard was paid to the adequacy and accuracy of the
                    historical narrative. They were put through by high-pressure salesmanship and subtle appeals to the
                    vanity of people who were willing to pay to have their biography, and perhaps their photograph,
                    printed in a county history. The publishers occasionally got a real historian to write the county
                    history. Such volumes are now important sources of information. For the most part, however, the
                    persons who actually did the writing were neither historians nor good writers, and the result has
                    been of little value to anybody except the publishers.</p>
            <p>Good or bad, however, many of these old county histories are now the only source of information
                    available to most people about the early history of the counties whose names they bear. Even those
                    who are most keenly aware of their deficiencies use them in default of other sources. Well-conducted
                    libraries are all the time trying to secure copies of county histories as their original copies wear
                    out. Various W.P.A. projects in Indiana have greatly hastened the process of destruction by their
                    use of these old books. It is almost impossible now to secure a copy of some of the more important
                    early county histories.</p>
            <p>The plan which produced most of the county histories does not seem to be in operation now. Other
                    sources of biographical publicity have cut the ground from under it. The Citizens Historical
                    Association, with headquarters at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-037-4-079"/> affords a cheaper and a better way of securing
                    biographical sketches; it preserves but does not publish them. Possibly future centennials may bring
                    the old style county history back, but, for the present, the field is not being cultivated.</p>
            <p>Educational institutions, especially universities, colleges, and the larger high schools, can do much
                    toward interesting students in the history of their localities, in giving them some idea of what a
                    county history should be, and training them in thorough historical study and in historical writing.
                    County historical societies ought to be able to select the proper person in each county to write the
                    county history, or at least to have various chapters written by the right persons and edited by a
                    capable person. The county historical society might also do much to promote the sale and
                    distribution of county histories.</p>
            <p>It may well be that in some cases the county histories advocated would take up the narrative where
                    the old, fairly satisfactory, county history left off. In most cases, it would be desirable, if not
                    necessary, to go back to the beginning—early settlements and the establishment of the
                    county. The mistake of the older histories of giving a history of the whole state, and sometimes of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, down to the time when the local narrative could be begun, should by all means be
                    avoided.</p>
            <p>For the history of most counties in Indiana, the county records in the courthouses furnish a
                    substantial basis. In many counties the Historical Records Survey of the Work Projects
                    Administration has issued Inventories of the County Archives. These inventories should be a help in
                    learning what material is at hand and how it can be used. All possible sources of information, of
                    course, should be used, all of them with due caution. Even oral tradition coming down through
                    several generations, though it has usually been relied upon far too much and has to be discounted
                    according to scientific historical principles, often gives a flavor which makes the difference
                    between an interesting and an unreadable narrative.</p>
            <p>The whole plan for new county histories is still in the discussion stage. This suggestion is made,
                    not to start the production of county histories, but to present the matter for consideration.</p>

            <p>The authors of the two accounts, Joseph S. 'Allen and Henry P. Benton, were engaged in
                    surveying the reserves granted the Miami and Potawatomi Indians and half-breeds by the treaties of
                    1818. The work was begun in September of the following year. After surveying two small reserves, one
                    on Flat Rock Creek and the other at the Forks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, Allen and his companions began laying out the boundaries of the Big Miami Reserve,

                    </placeName> River. On November 25, 1819, they were forced to discontinue because of the hostility
                    of the Indians. Work was resumed the following spring. The official reports of the surveys, signed
                    by Allen as deputy surveyor, are in the Land Office in the State House, <placeName>

            <p>Since the author of the first account included very little punctuation and since the capitalization
                    is so irregular, it is difficult to be certain where a sentence begins or stops. A double space
                    indicates the probable break between sentences. Errors in spelling are numerous, but are not
                    indicated by the use of sic because its use would be so frequent as to disrupt the narrative.</p>

                        Mr. Burnett, where after having cooked and eaten our dinner, an Indian came to us and gave us

                        number of others to massacre us (notwithstanding he seemed so friendly in the fore part of the
                        day) for no other cause than that he had been shot by an american sometime in the summer of 1819
                        [?] which shot had broken his leg and passed through into his hip as he was in a sitting posture
                        being drunk; of which circumstance he had given us to understand the preceding Evening

               <hi rend="i">Anthony Wayne: Trouble Shooter of the American Revolution.</hi> By Harry Emerson
                    Wildes. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company, 1941. Pp. 514, xii. Frontis. $3.75.)</head>
            <p>Mr. Wildes has written, to use his own modest words, "the first [life of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>] to put the warrior-statesman in his proper social, economic, political, and military
                    setting" (p. vii). In so doing, he has utilized an impressive amount of material,
                    principally from manuscript sources, and has woven it into a narrative which affords usually
                    interesting and sometimes absorbing reading. Although the biographer's ambitious claim
                    concerning the completeness of the setting is scarcely borne out by the book, which is often weak on
                    background material, yet certain aspects of the confused political and social scene of Revolutionary
                    America as well as a number of military episodes are well and clearly described.</p>
            <p>The greatest merit of the biography is its completely impartial attitude towards its subject.
                    Unwarranted calumnies which have clustered about Wayne's reputation are refuted; but there
                    is no attempt to gloss over his objectionable qualities. Gradually, as chapter succeeds chapter,
                    Anthony Wayne emerges in clear delineation: brave, energetic, resourceful, persevering, essentially
                    shallow, undemocratic, ambitious, vain, touchy, impatient, harsh, inconsiderate, frequently though
                    not invariably intolerant, grasping—sometimes dishonest, not always truthful. Given the
                    sharpness of this portrait, one can but wonder at the subtitle which Mr. Wildes has seen fit to
                    choose: "Trouble shooter of the American Revolution." "Trouble
                    maker" would be more apt. Of all the contentious, headstrong, morbidly proud officers of
                    the Revolutionary Army, none but Sullivan could outdo Wayne in the picking of quarrels or the making
                    of enemies. His military career is strewn with rivalries, with broken friendships, with
                    recriminations. The author himself declares (p. 200): "In winter quarters Wayne was a heavy
                    liability. Trouble always boiled about him."</p>
            <p>But there are more serious things to quarrel with in Mr. Wildes' book than a meaningless
                    subtitle. In view of the general soundness of the work, it is doubly deplorable that the author all
                    too often interlards his factual material with fictional <pb n="397" id="VAA4025-037-4-093"/>
                    incidents or descriptions. There is no way of checking on these lapses, for the book contains no
                    footnotes and no documentation of specific statements, all references to sources being lumped
                    together at the end by chapters. For the most part, one can recognize the inventions easily, as when
                    the author describes in great detail a minor incident which no one would conceivably have recorded,
                    even if it had happened (pp. 39, 104–5), or lays bare his hero's secret feelings
                    as he watched his loved one (p. 25). Occasionally, however, this habit of imagination leads to
                    direct falsification on matters concerning which a reader might easily be deceived. The most glaring
                    instance of this is in the account of the Battle of Monmouth. After describing the background of the
                    battle in a manner both incomplete and inaccurate, the author records, with no warning to the reader
                    and with dramatic detail, a purely fictitious conversation between Lee and Wayne on the battle-field
                    (pp. 163–4). As a matter of fact, there exists an official report from Wayne to <placeName>

                    </placeName> of June 30, 1778, explicitly declaring that at no time on the day of the battle did he
                    and Lee confer personally: all their communication was by messenger.</p>
            <p>Such a breach of historical scholarship shocks the reader. Just how much of the book can be trusted?
                    To judge from a casual reading, the interesting and detailed story of Wayne's campaign in
                    the Northwest Territory, for instance, is free of such falsification; but can we be sure? Mr. Wildes
                    had better make up his mind whether he is going to write straight biography, which he can do
                    reasonably well, or historical fiction, and stick to his choice.</p>
            <p>One claim which the author makes is open to question. In the preface he declares: "In
                    preparing this book, I have visited every place that Wayne touched." It is very doubtful
                    that Mr. Wildes has done this in the case of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nsc">Nova Scotia</region>
                    </placeName>, the scene of the second chapter. Indeed, it is unlikely that he has even bothered to
                    look at a map of it. If he had, he could scarcely have made the gross error of referring to the
                    territory three times (pp. 17, 18, 27) as an "island." He would not have written
                    about the "Petitcoodia River" instead of the Petitcodiac, or "St.
                    John's River," instead of the St. John. He would not have declared that colonists
                    along the Petitcodiac "would have access to the sea only by a long sail northward around
                    Cape Breton" (p. 19), for he would have noted the <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-037-4-094"/>
                    existence of the Bay of Fundy, or, for any settlers living on the northern shore of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nkc">New Brunswick</region>
                    </placeName>, of the Strait of Canso. Finally, he would not have shared, as he apparently does,
                    "Wayne's amazement" (p. 19) that grants of land on the St. John and the
                    Petitcodiac were not between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Halifax</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Cape Sable. This chapter, characteristic of the almost contemptuous lack of
                    interest in things Canadian which is all too common in this country, will do nothing to help our
                    Good Neighbor Policy so far as the people of the Maritime Provinces are concerned. The publishers
                    are to be condemned for letting such a flagrantly sloppy piece of research, which any schoolboy
                    could have corrected, mar a volume which has many points to recommend it.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>The removal of the Potawatomi Indians from their tribal land in Northern Indiana in 1838 is the main
                    theme, which lends coherence to Mr. McKee's interesting collection of the letters of Father
                    Benjamin Marie Petit, young French priest serving as a missionary to these Indians from October,
                    1837, through November, 1838. Petit realized the broad implications of the problem of Indian
                    removal; he saw that the pressure of civilization was crushing the Indians—and his
                    sympathy, naturally, was for the Indians, whom he deemed more gentle than the savage and uncouth
                    white backwoodsmen. Petit's letters, twenty-one in number, vividly describe the forcible
                    expulsion of the Yellow River Potawatomi from Indiana in the late summer months of 1838. The letters
                    cover the period from April, 1837 (shortly before his departure for America) to January, 1839 (less
                    than a month before his untimely death): eleven are to Bishop Bruté, his ecclesiastical
                    superior, seven are to his family in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, and of those remaining, five are written to American officials concerned in the
                    removal of this particular Potawatomi band. The Appendix contains the short daily Journal of Father
                    Petit and the Baptismal Register kept by him.</p>
            <p>The significance of these letters is ably summarized by Mr. McKee in this extract from his Preface:
                        <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-037-4-095"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The Petit letters, for the most part translated and published for the first time, illuminate
                            this phase of pioneer times with almost brutal clarity. The devoted young priest, seeking
                            with all his waning strength to defend an immense, but moribund, cause; the hapless
                            Potawatomi, caught between an advancing tide and a menacing wilderness; the untiring and
                            unscrupulous government agents, harried by the incoming white men—all these meet
                            here in brief but photographed conflict. The inevitable defeat, a tragedy in the classic
                            sense, more than justifies the title given it—The Trail of Death.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The value of these documents is increased by a brief but scholarly introduction containing
                    information necessary to a proper understanding of the historical setting of the Yellow River
                    mission, the removal of the Potawatomi, and the missionary activities of Father Petit; a very brief
                    biographical sketch of Petit is also given. He was born in 1811 at Rennes, <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, the native town of Bishop Bruté, fifth Bishop of the Diocese of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>; he studied law and was an advocate until 1835, when he renounced the law and entered a
                    seminary to study for the priesthood—probably due to the influence of Bishop
                    Bruté. In 1836 Petit came to America, where he concluded his clerical training. His
                    ordination as priest was perhaps hastened by the death of the previous priest of the Potawatomi, so
                    that he was ordained in October, 1837, and began his mission among the Yellow River Potawatomi a
                    month later.</p>
            <p>It is to be regretted that Petit did not write more letters during his brief fifteen months as
                    missionary, for his writing revealed him to be a sincere and devout young priest, dedicated through
                    religious idealism to the rigorous life and many privations which it has ever been the lot of the
                    missionary to bear. Yet his humanness is revealed by little foibles such as his complaining of the
                    decrepitness of his horse, and his reiterating to his Bishop the need of securing a better steed.
                    The human problems arising in religious work are often mentioned; interesting incidents about his
                    Indian parishioners are treated in his letters to his superior, and these letters bring out social
                    aspects of Potawatomi life as Father Petit saw it.</p>
            <p>Mr. McKee, of the faculty of Culver Military Institute, has done a worth while task in collating and
                    editing the scattered manuscript material relating to Father Petit, one of the lesser known
                    self-sacrificing missionary priests in Indiana. This volume will be received with interest by all
                        <pb n="400" id="VAA4025-037-4-096"/> persons interested in Indiana history, Catholic missionary
                    work, or the removal of the Potawatomi by the government; the Indiana Historical Society is to be
                    commended for having brought out another worth while publication in its series.</p>

                    </placeName>. Among the historical characters the irrepressible Beaumarchais naturally plays the
                    main lead, but Arthur Lee, Dean, Franklin and others play important parts. Particularly well done is
                    the portrayal of British opinion on the struggle, largely through the person of Edmund Lanham,
                    merchant prince. Also the handicaps, jealousies, and general inadequacies under which the American
                    representatives and agents in Europe operated. With no funds, often pulling at cross purposes, not
                    even sure who was to be trusted among their own countrymen, and with British secret agents firmly
                    ensconced in the staffs of the American representatives—the miracle of final success
                    becomes no less a miracle.</p>
            <p>As would be expected of a historian at home among the documents on both sides of the Atlantic the
                    history is authentic; wherever the author exercises the privilege of literary deviation the fact is
                    indicated in the historical note at the end. The background of <placeName>

                    story which should be read, as germane to our life today as ever. The book contains a brief
                    bibliography and a historical note.</p>
            <p>Most historians read and criticize historical novels, many have the materials for one or more, but
                    few write them. Which of course accounts for the all too frequent mayhem committed by writers and

            <p>This is a little book about one of Indiana's literary figures, Sarah T. Bolton. It contains
                    a simple and uncritical tale of the life of the poet together with many of her poems. It is
                    appropriate that it should appear, for the story and the poetry are worthy of preservation. The
                    writings of this gentle lady made a contribution to the development of Indiana and to the state of
                    mind that is characteristic of Hoosiers. Her poetry contains frequent references to the homely
                    virtues, such as are expressed in the poem "Paddle Your Own Canoe," of which the
                    following is the first stanza: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The present issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> contains a larger number of
                    pages devoted to articles than the last issue. It is believed that the character of the articles
                    justifies this procedure, the first one being particularly timely.</p>
            <p>This occasion, however, may be taken to call attention to two opportunities for the readers of the
                        <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> to help in keeping it a publication worthy of their interest and to
                    render a service to those interested in the history of the state and nation. In the first place,
                    much documentary material of importance to Indiana's history remains in private hands,
                    unpublished, and unavailable to historians and historical students. Suitable material may be
                    published in the documentary section of the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> If you have letters,
                    diaries, or other written sources of our history, will you not send them in for publication? The
                    original will be returned safely to the possessor. In the second place, the genealogical portion of
                    the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> requires support if it is to be helpful. The editor will not have
                    time to go out and find material but he is anxious to publish genealogical material if it is sent to
                    him. Attention is directed to the contribution by Miss Florence Crawford of the "Gilman
                    Family History" and to "Genealogical and Historical Material in the Emeline
                    Fairbanks Memorial Library." No doubt such contributions can be made by others.</p>

                    Thinking that others might not know about the existence of this material, it seemed desirable to
                    publish a brief description. The work of collecting, preserving, and indexing such material is an
                    important and commendable function which many libraries might well emulate. It may be possible to
                    visit other libraries in the future, but whether that is possible or not, other librarians are
                    invited to send to the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> a brief statement of their

                                    copied. This work gives a fairly good directory of citizens of this period previous
                                    to the publication of the first city directory in 1858.</p>

            <p>John Collins, whose parents were from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, was a school teacher and, perhaps, a captain in the Revolution. He was said to have
                    been born in <placeName>
                        <country>Fairfax County</country>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1760. He died on March 18, 1826, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He married, August 14, 1788, Mary Catherine Kestner in Rockbridge, Augusta
                    County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Their children were Luke, Catherine, John, Hulda, Mary, Philip, Henry, Miller,
                    Rebecca, Juraldine Tardee, and Malinda. Mary Catherine Kestner may have been a descendant of John
                    Philip Kestner who came to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> in the early days, for there were a John and a Philip Kestner in Augusta County when
                    Mary Catherine was married, and one of her grandsons was named John Philip Kestner Collins. The
                    Collins family moved from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to the White Water Settlement in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1809, and to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1817 or 1818.</p>
            <p>Rebecca Collins, daughter of John and Mary Catherine Collins, was born on July 5, 1799, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. She died in 1879. In 1825, she married Johnson Douglass in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Johnson Douglass was born on July 15, 1784, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> of Scotch parents who originally settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. He died on May 7, 1829, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He had a brother Edward, and the family was related to the Paxsons or
                    Paxtons. The first wife (Mary Catherine Kestner) and two baby daughters of Johnson Douglass died. He
                    then married Nellie Russell, while still in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. They had two sons, Robert Russell, and Thomas. Johnson Douglass came to Indiana before
                    the state was admitted to the union.</p>
            <p>Johnson and Rebecca Collins (his third wife) Douglass had two daughters. The younger died in infancy.
                    The elder, Caroline Louisa Douglass married William Cain. She died August 8, 1858. William Cain was
                    the son of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Tabitha (Ciscal) Cain. Juraldine Tardee (Cain) Serogin was their daughter.</p>
            <p>I wish further information about the Douglass and Collins families. I especially wish to find
                    definite information about the service of John Collins in the Revolutionary War.</p>
