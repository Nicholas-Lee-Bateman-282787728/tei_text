                    publication. The occasion of this anniversary marks an opportunity to ensure that we continue to
                    provide our readers with lively, interesting writing that represents high standards of scholarship.
                    Please take a moment to fill out and return the postage-paid survey form included with this issue.
                    Your responses, criticisms, and suggestions will help us in setting a course for our centennial year
                    and beyond.</p>
            <p>Changes at the Indiana State Museum</p>
            <p>Douglas Noble, interviewed in the December 2002 <hi rend="i">IMH</hi>, announced his resignation as
                    director of the Indiana State Museum on January 9, 2003. Susan Williams—executive
                    director of the Indiana State Office Building Commission—was named interim director of
                    the museum.</p>
            <p>Expansion of Searchable Index Online</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> inaugurated a searchable index on its web site
                    (http://www.indiana.edu/~imaghist) last year, and we are pleased to announce that the index has
                    recently been expanded to cover indexes for issues since 1955. The indexes are searchable by author,
                    title, and keyword. Researchers can find page and volume references to names of authors, articles,
                    books, and places and to subjects that have appeared in the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The twenty-five-year general indexes published for 1930–1954 and 1904–1929 will
                    be added to the online index when they have been scanned and coded. An Indiana University Honors
                    College intern is currently working to code the index for the volumes from 1930–1954, and
                    we hope to have that index in searchable form before the end of 2003.</p>

            <p>The modern university is a secular institution, but its predecessors had religious foundations.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Historians have tended to attribute this transformation to a process of
                    modernization pioneered at well-known private institutions. Among those schools it began with a move
                    away from sectarianism, which led eventually to a form of education that was distinguished by
                    respect for the advancement of knowledge rather than demonstrations of faith. But private eastern
                    universities were not the only places where secularization happened; it also occurred elsewhere and
                    earlier, for different reasons and with different effects. State institutions, such as Indiana
                    University (I.U.), preceded the private colleges in moving toward nonsectarian education and,
                    eventually, secularization. In the case of Indiana, this early commitment, which was grounded in
                    democratic principles, helped establish the institution as the first public university in the state.</p>
            <p>Indiana University's early commitment to nonsectarian, or nondenominational, education
                    reflects in part the efforts of a powerful leader, Andrew Wylie, who saw within his own life the
                    need for flexibility in the profession of faith.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Indeed, he nurtured his fellow
                    founders' commitment to nonsectarian education throughout his long administration as the
                    first president of the university (1829–1851). Indiana University was fortunate that both
                    its first president and the first president of its board of trustees (David Maxwell) served for
                    exceptionally long tenures, providing oversight in the most vulnerable years of the
                    school's history. Wylie was president during the first thirty-one years of the
                    institution's existence, having been <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>The term "nonsectarian" was not used in documents
                            from the early nineteenth century at Indiana University. Instead, officials claimed there
                            were "no sectarian" tendencies or principles practiced at the institution
                            or that "sectarian influences" were not present on the campus.
                            "Nonsectarian" seems to have been applied retroactively to the period by
                            historians; providing an education without sectarian influences was such a new idea in the
                            early nineteenth century that there was no word for it. Early nineteenth-century Indiana
                            University was Protestant in its ethos, but in modern terms it was nondenominational.</item>

                    enrolled. Maxwell was the trustees' president for twenty-eight of the board's
                    first thirty-two years.</p>
            <p>Their long service was important for many reasons, but for the establishment of a nonsectarian policy
                    the commitment of Maxwell and Wylie was critical. There is little direct evidence about
                    Maxwell's views on nonsectarianism, and what there is derives from a few documents and
                    early historical accounts. But it is reasonable to infer that Maxwell supported Wylie's
                    position, since the president of the university could not have served long without his approval.
                    About Wylie, by contrast, much is known. He publicly expressed his views on nonsectarianism, and his
                    life reflected his religious tolerance, but early allegations by the school's opponents
                    have colored historians' treatment of the subject.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Presbyterian affiliation of Wylie and Maxwell, as well as that of other pioneer members of the
                    faculty, made their assertion of nonsectarianism difficult to defend. I.U.'s freedom from
                    sectarian status, however, was critically important to the college's identity in the early
                    years. It distinguished the institution from the denominational colleges in the state.
                    Nonsectarianism also helped to enhance Indiana University's relationship with the state
                    legislature, to establish its position as the first public university in the state, and to shape its
                    reputation with Indiana citizens. I.U.'s opponents, recognizing the political importance of
                    its nonsectarian status, regularly challenged the institution's claims.</p>
            <p>Beyond the strategic advantage that came from rejecting a sectarian label, however, there was a
                    larger purpose served by the policy: nonsectarianism helped ensure that higher education would be
                    open to all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs. That view, staunchly defended by the
                    university's earliest leaders in the face of much opposition, has rarely been noted and is
                    largely forgotten.</p>
            <p>The first faculty member at Indiana University was a Presbyterian minister, Baynard Rush Hall, who
                    arrived in the state around 1820, probably hoping to find employment in the newly conceived
                    institution. Hall believed his aristocratic habits and education made him a kind of misfit in
                    Indiana, or in Hall's terminology, a "big-bug."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> He
                    claimed that few people in Indiana could read or write and that he was "the <list type="footnotes">

                            University, his text offers an insider's view of the early development of the
                            institution. Unfortunately, the value of Hall's book is diminished by his
                            cumbersome and confusing writing. Hall uses fictitious names for most of the important
                            people and places identified in the text, including himself, and uses humor or sarcasm
                            throughout. It is often difficult to determine whether he intends for the reader to take his
                            account of specific episodes seriously or whether he is simply trying to entertain.</item>

                    Indiana Seminary (later named Indiana University) suggests that the early prejudice against the
                    young institution reflected primarily the alienation of the local community from educated people and
                    was not merely the result of a bias against Presbyterians.</p>
            <p>Religion became a more central focus for the complaints against the institution in 1827, when the
                    trustees decided to hire a second professor, John Harney, to teach mathematics. Harney, who was
                    "nominally" Presbyterian, was chosen by the trustees over several other
                    candidates. Hall reported that the locals objected to spending money on a second professor because
                    they "set no value on learning" and added that when the locals became aware that
                    Harney was Presbyterian, "the wrath was roused of people, religious and irreligious, of all
                    other sects."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> But the local citizens' group failed to prevent
                    Harney's appointment. The trustees had acted quickly, awarding the position to Harney when
                    they heard that a group was on the way to protest.</p>
            <p>Maxwell attempted to soothe the citizens' concerns over the hiring of the second
                    Presbyterian minister by noting that the board itself was religiously diverse, representing six
                    different denominations. He added that the board would watch the faculty vigilantly and remove a
                    professor the "instant danger is found to threaten the State from our present
                        course."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> In other words, any faculty member who threatened the

            <p>The Indiana General Assembly acted in January 1827 to create a board of visitors to assess the new
                    school. The visitors inspected the seminary's records, its course of study, and its
                    students and, finding the institution free of aristocratic or sectarian influences, they recommended
                    that Indiana Seminary become a college. The legislature accepted their recommendation, and on
                    January 24, 1828, established Indiana College.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Within a few months, the board
                    of trustees began looking for a president for the new college.</p>
            <p>Their choice was Andrew Wylie, an ordained Presbyterian minister, and he was inaugurated on October
                    29, 1829. Invited a few months later by the joint committee on education to address the state

                    odious spirit" of sectarian opposition. He then called on the legislators to help their

            <p>Unfortunately, Wylie's address before the legislature in early 1830 did not prevent further
                    attacks on the institution, which were characterized as the effort to "Drive sectarianism
                    out of Indiana College!" David D. Banta, however, suggests that everyone connected with the
                    institution denied that sectarianism was present on the campus: "The faculty said it was
                    not; the students said it was not; the board of trustees said that it was not; and legislative
                    committees said it was not.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Nevertheless, the presence of three Presbyterian

                    of Representatives on December 8, 1830. In the report, the trustees insisted that the section of the
                    act that established the institution and forbade the "introduction into the college of
                    sectarian tests, and the inculcation of sectarian principles" had not been violated. They

            <p>The board also assured the legislators that if faculty members at any time failed to follow the
                    expectations established, especially if they violated the constitution of the college by teaching
                    sectarian tenets to the students, the board would "promptly and fearlessly remove
                    them." Moreover, <quote rend="blockquote">

                            prevent the introduction of sectarian tests and qualifications, it will be perceived by the
                            General Assembly, that the institution at this time derives a further guarantee from the
                            religious complexion of the Board of Trustees …. Of this Board it is believed 4
                            are Presbyterians, or at least were so educated; 4 Protestant Episcopalians; 3 Baptists; 2

            <p>Despite these assurances, critics of the university still doubted the university's openness
                    to faculty members of other Protestant denominations. Two similar petitions submitted to the
                    legislature in late 1830 called for the selection of professors at Indiana College to be based on
                    religious affiliation.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> But a legislative committee rejected the request:

            <p>The committee report argued that complying with the petitioners' request would violate the
                    state constitution, which clearly outlawed any "religious test… as a
                    qualification to any office of trust or profit." In addition, the committee noted that the
                    petitioners' request violated the charter of the college, which stated in their words that
                    no "president, professor, tutor, instructor, or other officer of the college"
                    could be required to profess a particular religious opinion. Nor should "any sectarian

                    would prove to be more dangerous to the new college than the internal squabbles among the governing

                    achieve a share of the control of Indiana College and representation within the faculty. They

                    appointment policy for the board would allow "a due proportion from other religious
                    denominations and breathe into it a new spirit, full of life and vigor."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>The conference members also appointed a committee to distribute a copy of the petition to all the

                    least six more petitions were submitted and referred to a legislative committee. One of the members
                    of the Methodist petition committee was William Daily, who was to become the third president of

                    their way to establishing their own institution of higher education. The charter for Asbury College,

                    board of trustees, who was particularly "eager to be on very friendly terms with
                    me" and who asked Wylie to preach at his church and "to contribute toward the
                    purchase of a Parsonage" for the congregation. Wylie indicated that he "cheerfully
                    complied with both requests, adding that Ballard "visited me in my room in the college very
                    frequently." Wylie reported that Ballard urged <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>that a certain professorship should be established, to be called the <hi rend="i">Wesleyan</hi>–it would conciliate and gratify the Methodists. I was indeed
                            desirous that the professorship should be created and that a gentleman, who was spoken of
                            for that purpose, a preacher of some distinction in that church, should be the person to
                            occupy it.</p>
                    </quote> Wylie, however, objected to calling the position the Wesleyan professorship, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>not because of any antipathy I might be supposed to have either to Wesley, or that numerous
                            and powerful sect which he was the founder, but simply because it was a sectarian name. I
                            would have had the same objection to the name of Calvin, or to the name of any other man
                            with which the bitter feelings and atrocious prejudices of sect had become associated. I had
                            a still stronger reason for my opposition: By accepting the place which I held in the
                            Institution I had virtually pledged myself to the public to keep it clear of sectarianism:
                            and to consent to call any professorship by the name of Wesley, would be to give to his
                            followers a pledge inconsistent with the former: so that, in the one case or the other, I
                            must prove unfaithful—a predicament in which I could not consent to be
                            placed—All this I candidly stated to Mr. B. at the time. Hence <hi rend="i">his</hi> enmity.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>It is surprising that a prominent member of a family known for its opposition to religion was
                    appointed to the board of trustees at Indiana University in the mid-nineteenth century. Yet Indiana
                    citizens also elected Owen to the state legislature and to Congress during the same period.
                    Owen's active, ten-year presence on the board indicates that the trustees were tolerant to
                    an extent that could easily be overlooked. More important, Owen's service on the board for
                    that length of time and, even more, his willingness to be a spokesman for the institution imply that
                    he felt comfortable in that role. These factors also indicate that Owen believed that the university
                    was truly nonsectarian.</p>
            <p>Claims of Presbyterian control of I.U. nevertheless continued to gain currency, even to the point of

                    </placeName> attorney Alexander Davidson, writing on July 28 of that year, lamented the state of the
                    contest between Governor Samuel Bigger and his challenger, James Whitcomb: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Until within a few days we were electing our candidate for Governor, but matters have assumed
                            a new phase. The attempt has been made, &amp; I fear with some success to array the
                            whole Methodist Church against Gov. Bigger, and for these very grave
                            reasons:—Some 12 years ago the Methodist Conference memorialized the legislature
                            to appoint a Methodist minister Professor in the Indiana University. Two ministers who were
                            written to on the subject replied that there was no one in the Conference whom they could
                            safely recommend for the station. Upon the faith of that statement Bigger (who was then a
                            member of the legislature) moved to lay the memorial on the table with the simple remark
                            that there was no minister in the State of that denomination qualified to fill the place of
                            professor. This charge has slept until Whitcomb the loco candidate for gov. waked it up

            <p>According to Davidson, the claim that there was not a Methodist in Indiana who was qualified to be a
                    professor at Indiana College in the early 1830s was made by two ministers, apparently from the
                    Methodist denomination, and not by Bigger. But historian Robert Clark, in an article about the 1843
                    gubernatorial election, states that it was Bigger himself who made the claim that "when <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> University wished to get a Methodist professor 'they had to send to Europe for
                    him."' Clark adds, "the fact that no Methodist preacher in Indiana was a
                    college graduate" suggests that "Bigger's contempt was not altogether
                    unfounded" and notes that when Bigger laid "the proposal on the table, he secured
                    the overwhelming support of his fellow legislators."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were fewer Presbyterians than Methodists in early Indiana, partly because Presbyterians
                    insisted on an educated clergy, while Methodists accepted lay ministers. According to L.C.
                    Rudolph's history of the Presbyterian Church in Indiana, "Ministers of the
                    Presbyterian Church were always going away to school," while the Methodist lay preachers
                    could more easily follow the settlers who "were going deeper into the woods."<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Lay ministers contributed to the spread of the Methodist faith in Indiana,
                    but at a time when college presidents were typically members of the clergy, the Presbyterians held a
                    distinct advantage over the Methodists in the field of education. In a 1921 article on Methodism in
                    southwestern Indiana, John Iglehart observed <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>that among the backwoodsmen who first settled Indiana there was much illiteracy, and that
                            both secular and religious education was greatly to be desired … [I]t must be
                            admitted that the stand taken by the Presbyterians, both in the matters of secular education
                            and in the demand for an educated ministry, have in a substantial degree aided in the
                            elevation of those standards [and] to that extent they are entitled to credit.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>I.U.'s heavy reliance on Presbyterians to staff the institution left it vulnerable to
                    accusations of sectarian control, which must have been evident to the supporters of the institution
                    although they were steadfast in denying the charge. The early leaders of the school probably
                    believed that they had no choice, since in the Midwest few ministers from other traditions were
                    educated in the early years. Presbyterians, therefore, filled the void.</p>

            <p>A look at the makeup and experience of I.U.'s early student body offers further evidence
                    that the prominence of Presbyterians on the staff did not undermine the school's
                    nonsectarian mission. Theophilus Wylie's history of Indiana University lists all of the
                    students named in one of the university catalogues and offers brief biographies of those who
                    graduated from the institution, beginning with the class of 1830 and continuing until the class of
                    1887. Some biographies included the students' religious affiliations. Since T. Wylie was
                    himself both a Presbyterian pastor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a professor at the university, it is likely that he personally knew the religious
                    affiliation of those students who were members of his congregation, hence the proportion named as
                    Presbyterians may be unduly large. But he also identifies the religions of some students who were
                    not Presbyterians. He lists biographies of 147 graduates of Indiana University who attended during
                    Andrew Wylie's presidency; fifty, or 34 percent, were Presbyterian; an additional
                    twenty-one, or 14 percent, belonged to other religious denominations (including ten Methodists, two
                    Baptists, two "Christians," and four Episcopalians), and seventy-six, or 52
                    percent, were not identified by religious affiliation.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wylie's information on the earliest graduates of the institution shows that they represented
                    a variety of denominations from the beginning. Of the three students in the first graduation class
                    (1830), one was a graduate of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Theological Seminary and an ordained minister of the gospel, which implies that he was
                    a Presbyterian<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Neither of the other two was a member of a church, although
                    one, James Dunn, was a major supporter of a Presbyterian congregation. The first student to be
                    listed as belonging to a different denomination was Andrew Thickstun, a preacher for the Methodist
                    Episcopal Church, who graduated in 1836. In the class of 1837, Wylie lists two Episcopalians and one
                    Presbyterian, while the denominations of the other seven students are not given.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Probably the best source on student experiences during Andrew Wylie's administration is a
                    diary written by Richard Henry Holman, an 1837 graduate. Holman's father, Jesse, was a

                    that Holman at least was not a bigot. His attendance at Methodist services may also imply that
                    Holman, scion of a strong Baptist family, was not prejudiced in his religious practices. When Holman
                    writes in reference to his fellow students, "On Sunday, the Faculty recommend them to go to
                    church," the use of the word "recommend appears to confirm that students were not

            <p>After a brief illness resulting from an accident, Wylie died on November 11, 1851, and his funeral
                    demonstrated symbolically the distance the university had come from appearing to be a Presbyterian
                    stronghold. The sermon was delivered in the university chapel by Daily, who was a Methodist, an
                    alumnus, and Wylie's good friend. (Wylie had even suggested to a board member that Daily
                    would be a good candidate for a professrship.)<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his funeral address Daily praised Wylie as "one of the best and most valued friends of my
                    youthful days and riper years" and as "my <hi rend="i">Instructor</hi>—and to me a Father as well as my friend and brother
                    minister…. the Protestant Episcopal Church has lost in him one of her brightest
                    ornaments." Daily, who was with Wylie at his deathbed, reported that "[a] few
                    minutes before he departed, at his request, I knelt by his side and offered up prayers to God in the
                    name of Jesus; at the close of which he responded, 'Amen' four times."<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wylie was a firm supporter of a collegiate education freed from the limitations imposed by sectarian
                    tenets. He advocated his position in his writing and in his public addresses, and he lived his life
                    as a witness to his convictions. For a man whose own commitment to the Presbyterian Church
                    eventually faltered, it must have been ironic to be accused of trying to foist Presbyterianism on
                    young students. While the battles between Presbyterians and Methodists challenged Wylie's
                    administration, his personal friendship with a Methodist minister was more representative of Indiana
                    University in the second half of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>The claim that state universities were nonsectarian is rarely taken seriously by historians. Some
                    argue that the state institutions described themselves as nonsectarian for practical reasons,
                    specifically to attract a larger pool of potential students. Others imply that the assertion was a
                    ruse and the universities were actually controlled by various religious denominations throughout
                    much of the century. Few acknowledge that nonsectarianism was an important component <list type="footnotes">

            <p>According to Johnson, "the institutional mission" of state universities in the
                    antebellum period was accompanied by a "parallel development toward public control and
                    public support." Nevertheless, it would take many years before the concept of
                    "public" would become a reality. Yet, during the "great proliferation of
                    denominational colleges as the dominant type of institution … an alternative

                            all," but it did not mention religion. The act that established Indiana College on

                    institutions, however, did not follow a clearly discernible path from a nonsectarian position to a
                    secularized one. Instead, the move was gradual and even imperceptible at the time. Nonsectarianism
                    and secularization share several characteristics. Both resist religious dogmatism, and both are
                    associated, to a degree, with religious tolerance and democratic principles. Adherence to
                    nonsectarianism, therefore, paved the way for institutions like Indiana University to move toward
                    secularization.</p>
            <p>In the first half of the nineteenth century Indiana University was essentially a Christian
                    institution. The school offered morning prayers and sabbath services, and it required that students
                    take religious courses. It is also evident that many of the people closely associated with the
                    institution, especially in its earliest years, were members of the Presbyterian Church.
                    Nevertheless, the history of the university during that period indicates, as its leaders maintained,
                    that it was never a Presbyterian institution and that it was always nonsectarian in practice.</p>
            <p>The university's claim to a nonsectarian status was critically important to its mission.
                    Among public universities in the United States, Indiana University is one of the oldest, founded at
                    a time when the distinctions between private and public institutions of higher education were
                    blurred. As I.U. approached the middle of the nineteenth century, its supporters clearly needed to
                    define its mission in contrast to that of the religious colleges in the state. The
                    university's nonsectarian status became the point of difference most frequently cited.</p>
            <p>The reasons for Indiana University's tenacious adherence to nonsectarian status are not
                    clear. Perhaps I.U.'s supporters promoted nonsectarianism simply because it was the only
                    characteristic that distinguished the institution from the other colleges in the state. Perhaps the
                    university's nonsectarian policy helped it to attract students, although little or no
                    evidence exists to support that interpretation. The evidence suggests that at least some of the
                    school's leaders and backers supported nonsectarianism because of their religious and
                    democratic principles. These principles are most evident in Wylie's insistence that
                    religious people should accept individuals regardless of their beliefs, in the 1840
                    trustees' statement that education must be open to all regardless of their religious sect,
                    and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Nonsectarian education was an important component of Indiana University's mission during the
                    early years. Throughout that period, the university's faculty and supporters believed that
                    it could be both nonsectarian and a religious institution. For a time, it was. Nonsectarianism,
                    however, set the stage for the gradual secularization of the institution that would take place at
                    Indiana University in the second half of the nineteenth century.</p>

            <p>In the last week of May 1862, Indiana newspapers broke the Indiana state "Bonds
                    Fraud" story to shocked Hoosiers. The newspapers had one part of it wrong—the
                    financial securities in question were Indiana 5 percent stock, not bonds. However, the press was
                    right about the fraud: two miscreants, using as collateral some $2,538,000 in fraudulent
                    securities, had parlayed them into a fortune in the <placeName>

                    $360 million in today's dollars).</p>

                    </placeName> financial markets were essential to Indiana's mobilization for the Civil War
                    and since the leaders of the state's political parties fought one another fiercely in the
                    newspapers during the war, from late May to late June 1862 only the news from the combat fronts
                    garnered more ink than the financial scandal. Although the fraud had been carried out in the course
                    of the preceding year and a half, newspaper editors and the public treated the scandal as a
                    one-month wonder. After June 25, 1862, when a <placeName>

                    the matter vanished from public view.</p>
            <p>These events are interesting for several reasons. For one, they remind us that persons with access to
                    wealth and power have threatened the stability of the economy in the past, as corporate malfeasance
                    at Enron and accounting firms has done recently. Second, exploring the fraud increases our
                    understanding of the administration of Governor Oliver P. Morton as its members worked tirelessly to
                    manage both the financial crisis created by the stock fraud and the political fallout. They
                    exploited new technologies of the era, particularly the steam-driven printing press (which produced
                    penny newspapers in large quantities), the telegraph, and the railroad network, to publicize their
                    story and to coordinate activities that ranged from northern <placeName>

            <p>As was true of all northern states, industrialization had transformed Indiana's economy in
                    the 1850s. The use of interchangeable parts to make machines as diverse as sewing machines and steam
                    locomotives greatly reduced their costs while increasing the volume of production. In order to
                    deliver the mass-produced items to markets, thousands of miles of railroads were built, over 9,000
                    miles in the Midwest alone in the 1850s, linking the prairies along the <placeName>

                    part of the settlement of the default, Indiana offered $4 million of state stock to be
                    exchanged with the bondholders for their defunct bonds. This stock paid a dividend of 5 percent, so

                    bear the name of the owner, and the act prohibited issuing stock certificates made payable to
                    "the bearer." Under this law, when an owner of Indiana 5 percent stock wished to
                    sell it, the seller surrendered the stock certificate to the Indiana state agent, who cancelled it
                    and then issued a new stock certificate to the buyer with the buyer's name written on it.

                                Smith) to investigate the fraud. During June 1862, the committee interviewed the Indiana
                                officials directly involved in the matter as well as J. F. D. Lanier. The committee

                                lax in its procedures and controls and censured the state and Lanier for not making the

                    certificate, he took one of the signed certificates from the files and filled in the name of the new
                    owner, the date of the transaction, and the dollar amount of the stock. After counter-signing the
                    certificate, the state agent recorded the transaction and handed it to the new owner.</p>
            <p>In March 1859, the legislature, perhaps responding both to the recent availability of direct rail
                    connections and to a concern to reduce the opportunity for fraud, changed the procedure by mandating
                    that the auditor and treasurer no longer sign stock certificates in advance of sale. Instead, the

                    agency's affairs. He found three volumes of illegal already-signed Indiana 5 percent stock
                    certificates in the office files, contravening the legislature's three-year-old mandate
                    that they be destroyed. Hudson destroyed the stock certificates by punching holes through the
                    signatures of the state treasurer, W. R. Nofsinger, and the state auditor, H. E. Talbot, who had
                    held those offices between 1855 and 1857. Subsequently, Hudson discovered that before his arrival
                    some of the agency's inventory of illegal certificates had been fraudulently issued. When
                    financiers came by the agency office at 52 Wall Street, between <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Hudson said he immediately confronted Stover, who admitted that he had issued some stock certificates
                    without receiving a genuine stock certificate in return. Stover claimed that the value of fraudulent
                    certificates did not exceed $250,000 and he asked Hudson to keep silent, in return for
                    which he would return at least $25,000 worth of fraudulent stock certificates every week
                    until all had been recovered. Hudson said he also met with Hallett, who agreed to cooperate with
                    Stover in retrieving the fraudulent stock certificates.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hudson said he agreed not to expose Stover and Hallett during the two or three months that they said
                    it would take to recover the fraudulent certificates because he believed that the men would abide by
                    their agreement: exposure, he believed, would ruin both of them. Moreover, all three men knew that
                    prosecuting the fraud might shatter Indiana's fragile credit standing. During the spring

                    pledged. Evidently, they felt that they had the state over a barrel: if public disclosure of the
                    fraud would discredit the state, then they believed the state agent had no alternative but to keep
                    the fraud secret. By the late fall, Hudson realized that the miscreants had no intention of

                    over almost that amount to Hudson for destruction. But the state agent had meanwhile discovered
                    during the normal course of business that several financial houses were holding yet more of the
                    phony certificates as collateral for loans they had made to Hallett. The two confidence men had

                    duties, passed "sin" and luxury taxes on consumer goods, modernized banking
                    practices inherited from the Jacksonian era, and introduced the greenback paper dollar. In the
                    spring of 1862, the United States was able to sell $500 million of 6 percent bonds at par
                    because investors were confident that the federal government's tax revenue could easily
                    meet the interest payments. Similarly, in Indiana, a month after Fort Sumter was fired upon, the
                    legislature authorized Governor Morton to obtain $2 million in loans to finance arming,
                    clothing, and maintaining Indiana troops before they were mustered into federal service. To pay for
                    the bonds, the legislature passed a property tax to be used expressly for servicing this debt.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                    houses on Wall Street that had loaned money to firms that had used the phony stock as collateral.
                    Obviously, a loan based on worthless stock was insufficiently underwritten, so Lanier called in all
                    of the loans that Winslow &amp; Lanier had made in which the Indiana certificates had been used
                    as collateral. Lanier also <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-099-1-039"/> privately warned Jerome &amp;
                    Company (and perhaps a few other friends who held the forged stock as collateral) that he doubted
                    their authenticity.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The interactions among Hallett, Jerome &amp; Company, and Lanier shed light on the magnitude of
                    the fraud and the threat that it posed to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> financial market. Hallett had used the illegal certificates as collateral for loans,
                    and in turn his creditors would use the stock they received from Hallett as collateral on yet
                    another loan from a third financial institution. There probably were further links in the chain as
                    the financial institutions shifted assets to meet their changing business needs. If the financier at
                    the end of the chain holding the stock as collateral called the loan that had been made to the next
                    link in the chain, this could precipitate a succession of loan calls as each financial house in the
                    chain in turn collected the cash needed to cover its own obligations. If the amount of money
                    represented by the fraudulent stock had been insignificant, then a sequence of loan calls would
                    scarcely have caused a ripple in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> financial market; but the amount of money in forged Indiana 5 percent stock was large.</p>
            <p>It certainly exceeded by far the $250,000 admitted to by Stover. Evidently, Stover and
                    Hallett had already floated far more than that sum when Hudson had first confronted them in March,
                    and throughout the year they used the time gained by stalling Hudson to forge yet more certificates
                    and introduce them into the market. And Hallett and Stover had greatly compounded the potential
                    problem by leveraging the stock in two ways. First, they used some of it as capital for a wildcat
                    bank they established in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, in which Hallett installed Stover as the president. They then issued bank notes
                    secured by the purported value of the Indiana stock. A wildcat bank typically would issue notes
                    several times the value of the capital invested in it, and Hallett used the notes from their own
                    bank to purchase railroad securities.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Second, Hallett also bought railroad shares with the cash obtained from loans secured by the
                    fraudulent certificates. He bought the railroad stock on a 10 percent margin, which meant he paid
                    only 10 percent of the cost of the stock with the borrowed cash. The market value of the railroad
                    stock itself covered the remaining 90 percent. Hallett then used the railroad stock as collateral
                    for more loans. By these means, the miscreants leveraged the $2,538,000 in forged
                    securities into a stock portfolio that perhaps totaled more than $20 million. Calling the
                    loans based on this stock threatened the base of a $20 million paper pyramid. The results
                    were likely to trigger a <list type="footnotes">

                    Usher researched the legal issues and informed the group that the state was under no obligation
                    either to redeem the false stock certificates or to pay interest on them. Moreover, in the attorney

                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the West, Henry Halleck's forces were off in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> backwoods quelling guerrillas or stolidly camping in the mud along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River. And, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, Gen. Don Carlos Buell's army seemed to have settled in for the winter to
                    enjoy the hospitality of the bluegrass country. A gloomy mood among Unionists was reflected in the
                    depressed financial markets. After the fraud became public knowledge, some observers speculated that
                    patriotic motives led Hall to let the Indiana fraud case collect dust on his desk. They contended
                    that publicizing that Hallett and Stover had used $2 million of fraudulent Indiana 5
                    percent stock to build an unsecured portfolio of perhaps $20 million would have started a
                    panic on Wall Street. According to their theory, Hall kept the matter a secret until victories could
                    buoy Union spirits and the markets.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About six weeks after Hall took charge of the case, the Union armies east and west began to advance,
                    providing a period of positive news within which to begin prosecution. In the first week of April,
                    Gen. Ulysses S. Grant won the bloody battle at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the Union army was marching into northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. In the East, Gen. George C. McClellan successfully transported the Army of the Potomac
                    to the peninsula between the York and James rivers and was inching toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Despite this rise in Union fortunes, Hall still did not prosecute, which suggests that
                    considerations other than patriotism motivated him to delay.</p>
            <p>Eventually Hall was forced to initiate proceedings against Hallett and Stover in May, when Hallett
                    attempted to obtain a loan from the Park Bank in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, using as part of the collateral an Indiana 5 percent stock certificate with a face
                    amount of $10,000. Two officers of the bank, James Porter and John Hayles, witnessed
                    Hallett's attempt to secure a loan on the stock. Word of the fraud had been quietly
                    circulating on Wall Street for months, since Lanier had called all of the loans that he had advanced
                    on the stock certificates showing Hallett as the owner and had warned some bankers about them. The
                    Park Bank men took the stock certificate to the state agent, who informed <list type="footnotes">

                    associates, Porter and Hayles did not take the news quietly, and the newspapers soon reported the
                    fraud, which forced the prosecutor to act.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, during the spring of 1862, while waiting for Hall to prosecute, Hudson quietly persevered
                    in recovering phony stock certificates from Hallett and Stover. By late May 1862, he had obtained
                    and destroyed about $700,000 of them. But the Indiana officials in <placeName>

                    </placeName> began to realize that even this vast sum was far less than Hallett and Stover had put
                    into circulation. The officials now estimated that there might be an additional $500,000
                    in illegal certificates circulating in the financial market.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    </placeName> that he now believed that Hallett and Stover had circulated about $1.2

            <p>At the same time, the Morton administration moved quickly to arrest Stover. Because Stover was

                    </placeName> Railroad shares and cheated investors out of $2 million before decamping to
                    Canada. Coincidental with the exposure of the 5 percent stock fraud in late May 1862, Treasurer

            <p>But Stover's lawyer, Joseph K. McDonald, who had served as attorney general in the

            </p>
            <p>On Tuesday morning, May 27, Morton telegraphed Hall that they had Stover in custody. He urged Hall

                    were en route, Morton had wired Hall imploring him, "Don't let Stover see anyone.

                    press charged the Black Republicans with waging a costly, pointless war, destroying civil liberties
                    in order to benefit their war-profiteering friends and to bring about a racially mixed society.
                    Predictably, Democratic papers tarred Morton with covering up the fraud, while the Republican press

                    questions pertaining to the fraud: was the state obliged to honor the fraudulently issued stock, and
                    had the administration engaged in a criminal act by keeping the fraud secret for almost a year and a
                    half?</p>
            <p>While some <placeName>

                    </placeName> newspapers were contending that Indiana should honor the forged certificates, honoring
                    hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of this phony stock would have exceeded the
                    capacity of the state to pay the interest on the authentic Indiana 5 percent stock and on the war
                    loans. If the value of Indiana's securities had collapsed in the market, the commissioners
                    would have been unlikely to place the additional war loans, and Indiana would have been unable to
                    mobilize troops for the Civil War. Consequently the Morton administration immediately announced that
                    Indiana was not legally obligated to honor the fraudulent certificates.</p>
            <p>On Friday, May 30, former Attorney General Usher released a public letter stating that an <quote>
                        <p>examination of the law authorizing and governing this class of securities will dispel all
                            fear of liability of the State for the payment of those false certificates.</p>
                    </quote> Usher claimed that Indiana law was explicit that a state agent could issue a new
                    certificate only to bondholders who surrendered their old defunct state bonds or to subsequent
                    buyers of the stock when sold by its owner. Moreover, only transfers that were duly recorded on the
                    books of the state agency in <placeName>

                    </placeName> could be valid. Because the certificates issued by Stover violated these provisions of
                    the law, Usher assured Hoosiers and the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Morton also addressed the issue in a letter to the committee formed by the <placeName>

                    issue and transfer of our state stocks. Be sure to get all." In his letter to the stock
                    exchange committee, Morton reviewed the procedure stipulated in the legislation for issuing an
                    Indiana 5 percent stock certificate. He, like Usher, concluded that certificates not issued through

            <p>However, questions about the propriety and legality of the Morton administration's failure
                    to report the crime continued through June. The administration's need to preserve the
                    state's credit had provided strong motivation for officials to cover up the fraud. On
                    Friday, May 23, the trading day before the fraud was publicly disclosed, the price of one share of
                    Indiana 5 percent stock was $81.50. On Monday, May 26, the first trading day after the
                    news accounts, the price declined by 8 percent. Critics claimed that Indiana officials delayed
                    publicizing the fraud as long as possible in order to sell the war bonds before the state's
                    credit rating collapsed.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    </placeName> financial community was outraged because the coverup had provided Hallett and Stover
                    with an additional fifteen months to flood the market with more than $2 million of
                    fraudulent securities. The loans extended to Hallett were under-collateralized by that additional
                    amount. Wall Street spokesmen complained that the pair had engaged in "the most
                    extraordinary speculative transactions of which the Stock Exchange has any record." The
                    value of railroad stocks purchased by Hallett on margin declined 5 to 10 percent when word of the
                    hoax reached the market. In the view of the <placeName>

                    half by concealing it and exposed the Stock Exchange and the community to its dangerous
                    influences." The stock exchange committee charged that, by failing to ensure that the
                    previously-signed certificates were destroyed as mandated by the legislature in March 1859,
                    "the State of Indiana was lax."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    that he had confronted Stover and Hallett in March of 1861 but failed to tell other state officials

            <p>In Hall's tenure as prosecutor, delayed prosecution was not unique to the Hallett and Stover
                    cases. Elected district attorney of <placeName>

                    </placeName> County in 1862, Hall remained the prosecutor until 1868. During those six years, Hall
                    chose not to prosecute more than 10,000 of the approximately 22,000 people that he indicted.
                    Hall's ties with the corrupt Tweed Ring probably explain this record.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After his election in 1861, Hall had allied himself with the sachems of Tammany Hall, the center of
                    the Democratic party's organization in <placeName>

                    </placeName> City, and Hall eventually acknowledged his allegiance publicly when he formally joined
                    Tammany Hall, in 1864. William Marcy Tweed emerged as Tammany's boss shortly after
                    Hall's election. Tweed's corrupt clique, the Tweed Ring, controlled <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City government until his downfall in 1871. Hall collaborated with the political
                    machine while serving as district attorney, and Tweed rewarded him by ensuring Hall's
                    election as mayor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> in 1868. The members of the Tweed organization aggressively and systematically used
                    their political power to enrich themselves and to solidify their electoral base. Extracting payments
                    from indicted felons who wished to keep their cases from coming to trial is typical of the Tweed
                    Ring's graft. Hall produced a lucrative flow of cash and favors-owed-to-Tweed when he chose
                    not to prosecute.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hallett was undoubtedly aware that he could deal with the Tweed Ring to delay prosecution.
                    Inevitably, word of the fraud would reach the financial market, and Hallett's creditors
                    would compel him to replace the fraudulent Indiana 5 percent stock with valid collateral. However, a
                    deal with Tammany Hall would keep the authorities from exposing the secret until the matter
                    otherwise became public knowledge and, thereby, increase Hallett's opportunities to squeeze
                    profit from the forged stock. District Attorney Hall remained silent about the securities fraud for
                    almost four months and only commenced prosecution after the affair became a public scandal. His ties
                    with Tammany Hall were a more credible reason for Hall's silence during this period than
                    was a patriotic impulse to shore up the Union's fortunes.</p>
            <p>The way in which Hall disposed of the Hallett and Stover indictments also suggests that Hallett had

                    that these "indictments, then, fail to show that the defendant has been guilty of the crime

                    $20 million. The <placeName>

                    holdings would pressure the market downward, sullenly allowed Hallett to sell the stock gradually.
                    Enriched with these proceeds, Hallett turned to other schemes. In November 1863, Morton received an

                    until she died in 1862. Stover later married his dead wife's sister. Evidently, the

            <p>The Morton administration successfully managed the fiscal crisis and its political fallout. The first
                    state agent kept the matter secret for nine months, expecting to recover the fraudulent securities
                    without publicly revealing lax fiscal administration on the part of the state. However, once
                    informed of the fraud, higher state officials discharged their legal obligation by informing the
                    governor, who then turned the matter over to the <placeName>

                    assigned political damage control the highest priority and coordinated their efforts by riding the
                    rails and burning the telegraph wires. They also used the mass media of the day, the newspapers, to
                    get their story out early and keep their version constantly before the public. Morton and his top
                    officials understood that the machinations of "BOSS" Tweed's politicos,
                    including the prosecutor, would control how the fraud case would be handled. After the indictments,
                    the Indiana officials let the matter die quietly in the corrupt corridors of the <placeName>

            <p>By managing the crisis successfully, the Morton administration maintained the confidence of the

                    disproportionately greater number of troops into the Union army than any other state, and, with the
                    proceeds from the war loans, the state effectively armed the 196,363 men who stepped forward.</p>

                    University students singing "Where have all the young men gone," mobilization
                    meetings, pickets, marches, and even the sweet aroma of burning grass. It also recalled graduate
                    students seeking advice about what to do when they were called up for military service (advice in
                    good conscience I could not give) and colleagues who gave all draft-eligible males students
                    "A" grades because they did not want to send them to die in the rice paddies of
                    "Nam." It also revived images: a student shot dead at <placeName>

                    </placeName> State and a naked Vietnamese child, burned by napalm, running in the street.</p>
            <p>In this book Wynkoop examines the history of student activism on Indiana University's <placeName>

                    "genuine" outside agitators, and the role of the faculty was nil. The roots of
                    dissent were deeply imbedded in the culture of a pre-World War II state university struggling to
                    achieve distinction. President Herman B Wells had used his considerable talent for persuasion to
                    move the institution away from its parochialism and had built a liberal university that could defend
                    the sex research of Alfred Kinsey. Wells even won support from a tight-fisted legislature that
                    looked for any excuse to cut the university's budget. His nonconfrontational approach was
                    so successful that he earns praise from Wynkoop; otherwise she has <list type="footnotes">

                    fought even minor changes in the institution's archaic rules. Wells's successors
                    were often slow to grasp both the depth and the nature of the social changes taking place across the
                    country.</p>
            <p>For radicalized students, Wells's liberal university was inadequate. They committed
                    themselves to confronting what Wynkoop describes as the administrative hierarchy and to challenging
                    both paternalistic policies and university governance. The social upheaval of the sixties, Wynkoop
                    argues and puts in a national context, was more than a protest against the war in Southeast Asia; it
                    was also a moment in American life when many voices previously silenced were heard.</p>
            <p>Wynkoop points out somewhat defensively that the universities on the east and west coasts were not
                    the only places where students demanded to be heard. Indiana and the other Big Ten schools had
                    powerful student movements, and the <placeName>

                    in American society. To make her point, Wynkoop combed the <hi rend="i">Indiana Daily Student</hi>
                    and local newspapers, read the scholarly literature on the radicalism of the 1960s, and interviewed
                    many student activists, both men and women, as well as some faculty to explain not only what
                    happened but why. This is the primary strength of her work.</p>
            <p>The book is partly chronological, with chapters tracing the rise of activism, the role of the New
                    Left, the antiwar movement, the different agendas within the activist leadership, the African
                    Americans' struggle for equality, the women's movement, and the misperceptions
                    about the counter culture in southern Indiana. In each instance there is a sense of struggle. But
                    the changes in the draft law, the end of the university's parietal rules, the greater
                    openness of the university to women and to blacks, plus the recognition by the most radical students
                    that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not Saint Petersburg on the eve of the Russian Revolution (although they may not
                    have put it that way) resulted in the gradual fading of activism. But the 1960s, Wynkoop argues,
                    were not a false dawn. Real changes in civil and students' rights occurred, especially for
                    women and blacks. Yet, despite the changing cultural context, their goals of equality remained only
                    partially attained. The means of reform changed—confrontation gave way to litigation and
                    the exercise of agency within the establishment. Changes in national policies also played a major
                    role.</p>
            <p>Wynkoop's is an interesting history of what I recall as a linked chain of minority
                    movements. Each—the protests against the draft, women's hours, governance, and
                    others—elicited responses from a distinct constituency. The largest mass demonstration,
                    in my memory, followed the Cambodian invasion, but it did not enlist a majority of students. Wynkoop
                    emphasizes throughout her work that personal physical violence and property damage were minimal.
                    There was always dialogue. As the university's policies changed, the more romantic among
                    the radicals gave up on Indiana.</p>

            <p>I arrived on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus from San Diego State University on the eve of the student upheaval and was
                    totally unfamiliar with the university's traditions. Many of the students' issues
                    were alien to me. San Diego State had no dormitory hours for women and a very powerful faculty
                    senate that controlled almost everything but the construction projects. Free speech for students and
                    faculty was a given. There were many women faculty members, and salaries were governed by civil
                    service regulations that prohibited gender discrimination. Although there were few students of color
                    at San Diego State, President Malcolm Love insisted that departments hire qualified blacks. While
                    the Vietnam conflict prompted heated arguments, there had been no confrontations on campus.</p>
            <p>Indiana, therefore, was a surprise. The faculty senate, it seemed to me, had little influence in
                    making policy. Although the history faculty was sharply divided on the Vietnam issue, most supported
                    the changes advocated by the students. Some historians marched with the protesters; some made
                    speeches against the war; some raised money for student bail; but, like the students, the
                    historians' commitments and causes varied. By the time I was elected to the faculty senate,
                    it was concerned about implementing the new rules. (I was the token male WASP on a committee
                    concerned with remedying minority-based salary problems.)</p>
            <p>Because I was never an insider, for me the credibility of Wynkoop's narrative rests
                    primarily on the interviews with student activists. Although historical memory is useful, it is
                    always self-serving. Undoubtedly, the activists told Wynkoop "a" truth about their
                    intellectual and personal machinations, and her citations to newspapers and to scholarly studies are
                    accurate. Professors David Thelen and James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who read the manuscript, would not have it otherwise.</p>
            <p>Most scholars write the books they want to read because they endorse a cause or condemn it. This
                    gives much historical writing a Whiggish cast. This, it seems to me, is especially true of
                    Wynkoop's work. She is so profoundly in sympathy with the activists that her writing about
                    them reminded me of a few lines by Wordsworth:<quote rend="blockquote">

                    "lock-in," and the many demonstrations against the Viet Nam War or for civil
                    rights. She finds the results mixed but largely positive. The radical politics of the era, Wynkoop
                    holds, resulted in an overall improvement of society. I think she is often right, but there are some
                    features of the era that deserve greater attention or even greater sympathy.</p>
            <p>The students at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus of Indiana University took many of their cues from television. Pictures from
                    Berkeley, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or other comparable universities provided tutelage in what good radicals should do.
                    However, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and its allies had initiatives of their own. It
                    was they who kept the protest against the rise in tuition tied to the antiwar movement. The result
                    forced the trustees and university administrators to be on the alert for eruptions from many
                    locations. The university's response was formal, authority-based, and designed to make both
                    firm and fair decisions.</p>
            <p>In the late spring of 1969, the boycott of classes had petered out, but there remained a standing
                    threat to disrupt the enrollment process at the beginning of the fall semester. University
                    administrators took the threat seriously. The result was an elaborate effort to forestall
                    disruptions. This effort involved the use of the professionals in the bursar's office, a
                    substantial body of personnel from the dean of student's office, and a large number of
                    officers from the safety division (university police). The increase in the size of the latter group
                    constituted the most notable feature of the plan.</p>
            <p>In the past, few safety division personnel had been used to maintain the peace. Instead, the
                    university had relied upon the local sheriff's office, some city officers, and occasionally
                    state troopers. Many of the sheriff's deputies hated the student radicals and were quite
                    ready to use clubs and other weapons. The traditional procedures were likely to produce street
                    clashes.</p>
            <p>The newly expanded university police force, which had received specialized training in crowd control,
                    became a means of protecting the protesters from the "ridge runners," so-called
                    because they lived in the hills south and east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Many of them were sheriff's deputies.</p>
            <p>The safety division also changed its own procedures in dealing with large marches. The focus was put
                    on assisting protesters by marching with them. The division's officers marched in front of
                    the demonstrators in large numbers and in nearly the same numbers on the sides. The effect was to
                    limit heckling and also to legitimize the march. This practice characterized the demonstrations that
                    followed Nixon's invasion of Cambodia, as well as those organized later in protest against
                    the killing of four students at <placeName>

            <p>I was appointed chancellor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus, effective July 29, 1969. Fall enrollment was a little over thirty days away.
                        <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-099-1-058"/> When I was appointed the trustees instructed me to establish
                    a code of student conduct and to present it to the next meeting of the board for approval. The code
                    was developed as requested, and it was adopted by the trustees. The code did not directly limit
                    speech, but it did limit where and how speech was to be exercised. There was no general discussion
                    of the code, and no special effort was made to solicit advice from either student or faculty
                    representatives. Later the code might be changed, but for the moment we simply wanted a set of rules
                    that would help preserve peace, which was a central objective for faculty members and for many
                    students.</p>
            <p>Outside of the major protests against Cambodia and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> State, there were few demonstrations that challenged the code. These largely involved
                    demonstrations and brief "sit-ins" against R.O.T.C. Students continued to direct
                    verbal abuse at their targets, but few of those activities constituted clear violations of the code.</p>
            <p>The relative quiet was in part a product of a developing faculty cohesion. Faculty members were
                    largely antiwar, but they were also supportive of the university administrators' efforts to
                    keep classrooms open. When the movement's effort to blockade classes developed, it was the
                    faculty who urged the blockaders and other students to return to class. In particular, the younger
                    faculty members of the chancellor's advisory committee were very helpful in persuading
                    those engaged in the boycott to cease and to allow students who wanted to go to class to do so. This
                    was accomplished without using the safety department.</p>
            <p>The culmination of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> State protest came about through a different mechanism. The students, out in large
                    numbers, threatened to close Bryan Hall unless the president and I held a public meeting in the
                    auditorium. The president agreed to the meeting, which was held at 4:00 p.m. before a very large
                    audience. I read a statement in which I rejected, on behalf of the university, all of the student
                    demands. There was no real rejection of my statement by the student government leaders, Parker and
                    King. In fact, looking back through thirty years it is hard now to remember exactly what did happen.
                    Students on the floor objected to the classroom blockages. Somehow the meeting slipped off to the
                    subject of grading and grading practices. It all ended quietly. We went home.</p>
            <p>Many American universities exploded violently. Indiana did not. The basic reason for this was the
                    nature of the student leadership, which chose more moderate ways. An equally significant factor was
                    the solid attachment to the university by a large proportion of the faculty.</p>
            <p>The quest for student rights continued with relative success. It was the antiwar movement that
                    declined in impact. The Viet Nam War continued … and continued and continued …
                    but the great mass movement on the campus ended. Perhaps this reflected the increasingly widespread
                    public opposition to the war. Perhaps it was the end of the draft. Whatever the cause, the issue
                    became less heated. The SDS was rejected nationally, and its allies faded away.</p>

            <p>We cannot pretend to write objectively and dispassionately about a book that recalls a place and
                    recounts an era that profoundly transformed our lives. We were Indiana University students and
                    activists in the latter years of the period revisited in <hi rend="i">Dissent in the Heartland</hi>,
                    and we appear (although not always accurately) in its pages.</p>
            <p>The 1960s were, for us, a time of personal as well as historical transformation. The experiences of
                    those years continue to shape how we see the world. Hearing again in Mary Ann Wynkoop's
                    book the voices of old friends and adversaries we are sometimes amused, occasionally saddened,
                    always filled with emotion. Most of Wynkoop's sources and subjects were our predecessors
                    and mentors: Guy and Connie Loftman, David and Wendy Cahill, Robin Hunter, Jim Wallihan, Allyne
                    Rosenthal, the late Rollo Turner, Robert Johnson, and many others. What Professor Wynkoop studied,
                    we all lived.</p>
            <p>Our generation came of age at a time when widespread social change was not simply an academic
                    concept, but a vital necessity. We were convinced we were right in our political beliefs and
                    consequently that we had a moral responsibility to engage in social action. In our own case,
                    although we are of different races, different religions, and different backgrounds, from the
                    beginning our activism was our bond. Forged at Indiana University, this bond has lasted more than
                    thirty years.</p>
            <p>Wynkoop accurately captures the apparent improbability of activism in the political and social

                    university policy, and the administrators were reflexively hostile to activists. Local authorities,
                    including the police, prosecutors, courts, and the local media, often responded aggressively to
                    campus protest, especially that of black students. The <placeName>

                    the Black Market on Kirkwood Avenue was an example of the sort of home-grown American terrorism that

                    right to lead independent, adult lives as it was a response to particular campus regulations. The
                    administrators and the politicians who were apprehensive about such rational and moderate changes
                    were essentially correct: once we began to consider ourselves adult, fully enfranchised citizens,
                    who knew what else we might demand?</p>
            <p>Wynkoop interviewed several older activists from the period and had access to the papers of others.
                    We wish she had talked to a few more and at greater depth (we would have been eager to correspond,
                    had we been asked), rather than relying so heavily on the local newspapers. Some of the
                    book's minor errors—"facts" we occasionally failed to
                    recognize about ourselves—probably stem from that reliance. More importantly, those
                    reporters seldom explored <hi rend="i">why</hi> students opposed the war against Vietnam, supported
                    civil rights, or even believed in a world beyond the intellectual and social limits of official <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Some of the book's misperceptions may well derive from Wynkoop's access to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> FBI's "COINTELPRO" files, which appear here in fleeting but
                    intriguing glimpses and which obviously need to be read with considerable skepticism. We are amused
                    that Wynkoop confirms, for example, what we always suspected: that the FBI was paying much
                    (incompetent) attention—at the explicit direction of J. Edgar Hoover, no
                    less—to a handful of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> peace activists and streetcorner revolutionaries. It is entertaining to learn, too,
                    that the dismal and short-lived "alternative" alternative newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Armageddon News</hi>, was in fact an FBI production. (The <hi rend="i">News</hi>
                    mysteriously appeared and disappeared in a few months, and nobody paid it the least bit of
                    attention.) And we would certainly like to learn more about the FBI informants who (Wynkoop reports)
                    infiltrated leadership positions in I.U. student organizations. We were told by our government
                    professors that that sort of thing was confined to the Soviet KGB and that we were paranoid to
                    suspect otherwise.</p>
            <p>The author recounts the seminal 1968 black student protest that shut down the fraternity bicycle race
                    known as the Little 500 that year, eventually forcing fraternities that had racist covenants to
                    delete them from their bylaws. Wynkoop also captures the importance of black and white students
                    joining together during the tense May 1969 class boycott and Ballantine Hall
                    "lock-in" of faculty negotiators that was sparked by a massive tuition increase.
                    Those events led to the formation of the United Student Movement (USM), which became the student
                    political voice on campus from 1969 to 1971.</p>
            <p>The author's treatment of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s true alternative (at the time the preferred term was
                    "underground") newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Spectator</hi>, is reasonably accurate,
                    although truncated. The I.U. administration believed it could kill the independent voice (originally
                        <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-099-1-062"/> a university-sponsored literary project) by denying it
                    advertising, but they failed; the staff lived on peanuts and printing costs were so low they could
                    be paid for by direct sales at twenty-five cents a copy.</p>
            <p>Some central voices are absent or only minimally remembered in <hi rend="i">Dissent in the
                    Heartland.</hi> One crucial example is Robert Johnson, then a graduate student and lecturer in the
                    emerging black studies program and an almost mythic figure in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> activist community, both for his historical perspective and for his modest, principled
                    wisdom. Johnson introduced us to each other in the fall of 1969, predicting correctly that we might
                    become friends, and he encouraged us to campaign together—the black activist and the
                    antiwar editor—for student body president and vice president.</p>
            <p>Especially under pressure, Bob was our wisest and most reliable friend, to whom we could turn for
                    unblinking advice. Wynkoop reports that on May 6, 1970, following the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> State shootings, we considered calling off a planned antiwar demonstration because of
                    explicit threats of violence. Bob quietly but firmly reminded us that, whatever our fears for other
                    students' lives and for our own, we owed it to those who had gone before us to act on our
                    beliefs.</p>
            <p>Many other stones remain untold—those of Fred Bullard, Tom Balanoff, Mimi Bardagjy, Margy
                    Baran, Bill Wiggins, Melanie Cloghessy, Mel Yancey, Tom DeWalle, among others. We thank Professor
                    Wynkoop for those she recounts and only wish there were more.</p>
            <p>Almost 150 years ago abolitionist Frederick Douglass warned that <hi rend="i">"Power
                        concedes nothing without a demand. It never has, and it never will.</hi>" All of us who
                    gathered together under the banner of "The Movement" in the 1960s believed this
                    principle and sought to challenge the political and corporate power structure of this country by
                    struggling against racism, sexism, poverty, and war at both national and local levels; Indiana and
                    Indiana University were touched by and contributed to the struggle for social justice in this
                    country—which did not begin in 1960 and did not end in 1971.</p>
            <p>Wynkoop's is the first extended study of political activism at Indiana University in the
                    1960s, and she has provided a map for future scholars, perhaps even herself, to revisit. Should she
                    do so, we hope she will take the opportunity to talk to us.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In that same vein, even though I was not a student at Indiana University during the
                    1960s, I was, like Mike King and Keith Parker, a part of the generation that was shaped by the
                    events of the sixties. It is true that I studied what they lived, but I also had lived, in a certain
                    sense, what I studied. That circumstance may be part of the problem—or
                    not—depending on your point of view. I was distant enough from the actual personalities
                    of the story to be relatively objective, but I was still close to the issues of that time.</p>
            <p>Professor Martin Ridge's thoughtful essay provides interesting insights into the ways in
                    which a then-recent transplant from <placeName>

                    </placeName> viewed the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> scene. I have never considered myself to be a "Whiggish" historian
                    before, but I suppose I will have to plead guilty to the charge. Chancellor Byrum Carter offers
                    insight into the perspective of an administrator at Indiana University during the last years of the
                    decade. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, I take issue with some of his conclusions. I wonder about
                    Carter's statements that SDS kept the tuition increases of 1969 tied to the antiwar
                    movement. My research led me to believe that the majority of students perceived that the Indiana
                    state legislature's decision to raise tuition came in reaction to campus protests across
                    the country—particularly those at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> State University and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University that made the nightly newscasts. I.U. students expressed frustration that
                    their own protests, in contrast to those, had been nonviolent. In fact, I would argue that rather
                    than student protestors taking "their cues from television," it was the
                    legislators who had spent too much time watching the evening news and not enough observing actual
                    events.</p>
            <p>Keith Parker and Mike King are right; I should have talked with them. It is one of the axioms of
                    trying to write an account of events in which so many people had a part that the greatest sin is one
                    of omission. It is true that I interviewed a lot of student activists from the earlier years of the
                    decade. As a social historian, I am interested in the ways that movements develop, and often the
                    early voices of those movements set the tone for later events. Dissent is always an act of courage
                    and especially so on a campus shaped by traditional and quite conservative values, as Indiana
                    University was in the early 1960s. From the very beginning, student activists like Guy and Connie
                    Loftman, Robin Hunter, Roller Turner, Allyne Rosenthal, and others approached political issues with
                    a firm belief in nonviolence <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-099-1-064"/> that carried on throughout the
                    decade. However, that does not excuse my not doing more interviews, and certainly I could have,
                    should have, pressed on.</p>
            <p>King and Parker wrote that they felt some of my "misperceptions" came from access
                    to FBI COINTELPRO files, but they did not provide examples of how I was misled by this research.
                    Frankly, I was simply amazed at how much time and energy the FBI spent on students who, for the most
                    part, protested peacefully. I wish I could tell who the FBI informants were, but I cannot. Reading
                    page after page of blacked-out information yielded little in the way of specific names. Sometimes I
                    could piece together who I thought was the subject of a report by the times and places mentioned,
                    but I was never certain enough of my suppositions to include them in the book. I am afraid that the
                    game of guessing the informants will just have to continue until someone confesses.</p>
            <p>I would hope that Parker and King might think about writing their accounts of their experiences and
                    encourage others that they mentioned to contribute to a collaborative history as well. I think a
                    collection of essays by participants would be a fascinating contribution to understanding this
                    decade that, as we have seen here, "provokes conflicting interpretations."</p>

                    $29.95.)</head>
            <p>James Whitcomb Riley would probably have been mortified by Elizabeth Van Allen's biography.
                    After all, as she demonstrates, he devoted at least as much effort to creating and maintaining an
                    image for himself as he did to his literary endeavors. One hopes, however, that deep down he would
                    have been grateful for this thorough, balanced treatment of his life, which allows him finally to
                    lay down the burden of virtual sainthood and treats his foibles and faults with sympathy.</p>
            <p>Van Allen's detailed and well-documented narrative covers the poet's life in
                    chapters from "A <hi rend="i">Child-World</hi>" to "Preparing a
                    Legacy" and includes a generous number of revealing quotations from Riley's
                    correspondence. She also places his life in the larger context of his times, showing how his
                    idealization of a simpler time helped his readers escape from the changes occurring in American
                    society. She concludes that it was this pandering to the nostalgic impulse that undermined
                    Riley's critical reputation.</p>
            <p>Van Allen's zeal to convey the impact Riley had on his contemporaries occasionally leads her
                    into misinterpretations: for example, her claim that Riley's popularity was responsible in
                    part for there being an Indiana Day at the World's Columbian Exposition in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1893 (p. 251) ignores the fact that every state had its "day"
                    during that fair. In addition, there are occasional lapses into jargon
                    ("validating" his audience, p. 121) or awkward phrasing ("to order grief
                    and to abstract and objectify the dead," p. 253). Finally, one could wish for more
                    consistent editing: over editing of quotes with brackets and <hi rend="i">sic</hi>s alternates with
                    instances of typographical errors, dropped words, and incorrectly cited titles.</p>
            <p>More substantively, Van Men could have explored Riley's personal relationships in greater
                    depth: she states tantalizingly that Riley "played an instrumental role in helping start
                    [Booth] Tarkington's literary career" (p. 243); more information would have
                    provided a nice counterpoint to Riley's inclination toward self-centeredness. This reader
                    would like to have learned more about the intriguing friendship between Riley and Eugene V. Debs,
                    which on the surface appears so improbable. In her otherwise cogent "Epilogue,"
                    Van Allen ignores the issue of Riley's string of failed relationships with women. Finally,
                    she does not analyze the contrast between his ability to eulogize an abstract, mythical past so
                    convincingly and his inability to produce more than tediously conventional elegiac poems for family
                    and close friends (p. 253).</p>
            <p>These quibbles aside, Van Allen has produced a fine work that will be the benchmark for any further
                    study of Riley's life.</p>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">American Pentimento</hi>, Patricia Seed argues that European traditions and goals,
                    rather than distinctions among indigenous societies between nomadic and settled groups, account for
                    concepts of "Indians" in the Americas. One purpose of this intellectual history is
                    to debunk the myth that a "universal" or international understanding justified the
                    transfer of significant assets from native residents to European settlers. Another goal, both
                    scholarly and political, is to show how the powerful paradigms of conquest continue to operate in
                    the disparate demands of contemporary indigenous peoples for land (in the north) or for dignity and
                    rights (in the south).</p>
            <p>Seven chapters form the core of a book in which Seed explores the nuances of language and practice
                    that distinguished English from Spanish "invention of Indians" as colonizers
                    pursued virtue and tangible wealth in the Americas. The English, who found moral value in farming,
                    ignored indigenous cultivation (done largely by women). By defining Indian society as one based on
                    hunting—a male occupation in the Americas, but a leisure activity for elites and royalty
                    back home since <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> times—settlers not only justified expropriation of
                    "wasteland" for "planters" (English settlers), but also paved
                    the way for future stereotypes of the lazy (male) Indian and for the twentieth-century claim that
                    cultural origin was grounds for refusal to grant indigenous communities rights to intensive
                    cultivation of land.</p>
            <p>The Spanish, in contrast, aimed to extract gold and silver for export to Spain, not to produce
                    agricultural wealth or moral strength in farming. Thus, Spaniards justified exacting mineral tribute
                    and labor from conquered indigenous societies as fair return for converting
                    "cannibals" to "Christians". Instead of taking
                    land—settlers and natives alike owned land to produce foodstuffs, while Spain drew from
                    Moorish law to retain ownership of the minerals and other underground deposits—the
                    Spaniards robbed the original residents of their autonomy. By separation or subjugation, Seed shows,
                    both European practices upheld a system that continues to deny Spanish American indigenous
                    communities the right to extract gold, diamonds, and oil and prevents North American Indian nations
                    from developing land that they supposedly never cultivated.</p>
            <p>To make her case, Seed turns to published sources, which range from the observations of conquerors to
                    treatises on land law from both cultures and both sides of the Atlantic, to trace a rich history of
                    ideas and legal practice. She leaves to others the task of fleshing out her sweeping argument
                    through the judicial records, administrative reports, and private correspondence.</p>
            <p>The rhythm of this meticulous comparative case study is broken by the addition of two stand-alone
                    chapters. A single chapter on Portuguese colonialism shows that initial reliance on Jesuit missions
                        <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-099-1-067"/> deprived Brazil's natives not just of mineral
                    rights and labor but also of land, making it perhaps the most devastating model for contemporary
                    peoples. However, this insight might have been woven into a more comprehensive
                    "Iberian" treatment. Further, the chapter draws attention to Seed's
                    silence about French and Dutch ideological and legal systems in the Americas and challenges to
                    Spanish and British models in the land-poor and quickly depopulated Caribbean. Similarly, a chapter
                    aptly titled "Fast Forward" flags the importance of the two-hundred year period
                    between the colonial systems and present societies, but, in a mere ten pages, only hints at
                    important connections and continuties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">American Pentimento</hi> raises the bar in the comparative tradition in Atlantic history
                    by offering a new paradigm, not only of the "invention" of Indians as an
                    ideological process, but also of the complex intertwining of morality, avarice, history, culture,
                    and ideas drawn upon by European societies to justify their right to extract wealth—
                    territories, minerals, labor—-from the Americas. Reaching back, Seed demonstrates that it
                    is imperative to understand the cultural origins of each colonizing society, and, looking forward,
                    she convincingly shows how colonial ideologies defined the roles and boundaries that Native
                    Americans seek to redefine in the present. For scholars and students of Atlantic history, this book
                    is a virtuoso demonstration of how key themes such as cultural encounters, empire and governance,
                    religion and society, Atlantic economy, and the circulation of ideas can, as the metaphor in
                    Seed's title implies, be painted into a multilayered picture that, when scratched, reveals
                    links between past and present. <hi rend="i">American Pentimento</hi> will provoke lively
                    discussions in graduate seminars and advanced-level undergraduate courses in colonial, Atlantic,
                    and, it is hoped, European intellectual history for some time to come.</p>

            <p>It has been William Clark's fate always to be overshadowed, first by his brother, George
                    Rogers Clark, and subsequently by the mercurial Meriwether Lewis. Yet he was a considerable figure
                    in his own right. A veteran of Indian wars in the Old Northwest before joining Lewis's
                    great journey of discovery, he held important posts <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-099-1-068"/> thereafter,
                    becoming brigadier general of militia and United States Indian agent for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Territory in 1807 and governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Territory in 1813. Based in Saint Louis after 1808, he was at the hub of western and
                    Indian affairs. Throughout, Clark remained an entrepreneur at heart, but he also dabbled in
                    ethnography and natural science. Yet, despite an honorable contribution from Jerome O. Steffen,
                    published in 1977, no biographer has captured the fullness and complexity of Clark's
                    career. When that task is undertaken, <hi rend="i">Dear Brother</hi> will prove itself an invaluable
                    instrument.</p>
            <p>The book publishes fifty-five letters written by William Clark, dated between 1792 and 1811, most of
                    them addressed to his brother Jonathan and all but four only recently rediscovered. Clark was no
                    belletrist. His spelling and grammar were eccentric, and his style was studiously matter-of-fact,
                    while gaps in the correspondence damage continuity. But James J. Holmberg has edited the letters
                    painstakingly, and his accompanying remarks and extensive notes streamline the collection and
                    enhance its value considerably.</p>
            <p>While only eight letters relate to the transcontinental expedition itself (all but one of them new),
                    they supply lost details, and additional letters illuminate Clark's further dealings with
                    members of the expedition. They provide fresh evidence of Lewis's troubled state of mind in
                    1809 and reinforce the probability that his mysterious death in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> resulted from suicide. And there are revealing and tragic glimpses of York,
                    Clark's slave, who accompanied him to the Pacific. Afterwards, York's desire to
                    remain with his enslaved wife in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and his pride and "notion about freedom" (p. 183) created
                    difficulties with Clark, earning him both a "Severe trouncing" and a spell of jail
                    in 1809 (p. 201).</p>
            <p>Indeed, slave management runs as a thread through the letters, which mirror the views of the day.
                    Clark regarded slaves as chattels, to work, hire out, or sell at will. Not without compassion, he
                    took measures to ensure slaves did not "Suffer when they have become infirm" (p.
                    251), but he regarded them as "Sleepy creatures" (p. 193) in need of occasional
                    flogging. Similarly, Clark's eagerness to turn every opportunity to pecuniary advantage
                    faithfully reflects his class and time. Within months of arriving in Saint Louis, he was assessing
                    the profitability of lead mines, salt licks, and prairie land and planning to ship trade goods from
                    the east to exploit local shortages. In 1809 he purchased a town lot "best Situated
                    … for Commerce and Storehouses" (p. 189) and established the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Fur Company. His activities exemplify the association of public service, economic
                    enterprise, and territorial development.</p>
            <p>The dispossession of the Indian was one inevitable consequence, and Clark himself helped liquidate
                    the Osage title to land in 1808 "fer a verry Small Sum" (p. 154). That said,
                    historians familiar with Clark's detailed reports to the secretary of war will find little
                    new about his important role in brokering peace between different groups <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-099-1-069"/> of Indians and the United States and in handling the growing native
                    unrest in the years before and during the War of 1812. What this book does provide is useful

                    </placeName> historian John R. Finger addresses this issue head on, making a good case for the
                    utility of a frontier framework for understanding the Anglicization of the region now encompassed by
                    the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. Finger finds some of Frederick Jackson Turner's insights,
                    "especially his suggestion of certain recurring patterns in the sequence of settlement
                        zones,<hi rend="sup">'</hi>' useful in explaining the transition of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> area from American Indian dominance to Euro-American control (p. xviii). According to
                    Finger, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> experienced several overlapping frontiers between the seventeenth and nineteenth
                    centuries, with those of'land takmg" and "market making" (the
                    development of a market economy) being of particular importance. Finger argues two major themes:
                    that opportunity in the form of land drove settlers into the region and that a marked tension
                    between local autonomy and central authority characterized <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> in this formative period.</p>
            <p>Finger, the author of two monographs on the eastern Cherokees, incorporates Indians into the story
                    throughout the book and emphasizes that "Native American adaptability and creativity amid
                    changing circumstances is one of the great underappreciated themes of frontier history" (p.
                    7). Indians such as the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Creeks, and Shawnees are portrayed by Finger as real
                    people, who disagreed with one another while sometimes impeding Euro-American expansion and
                    sometimes assisting it through warfare, treaties, and trade. Finger also pays notable attention to
                    the diverse physical environment of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and the ways that nature shaped human actions while simultaneously being altered by
                    settlers.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the book follows a narrative format, with chapter-length excursions into the
                    "social fabric" and the "frontier economy" <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-099-1-070"/> of late eighteenth-century <placeName>

                    between Indians and Euro-Americans, land cessions by Indians, the American Revolution, violent
                    conflicts between Indians and settlers, land speculation and political intrigue, the development of
                    a market economy, the transition to statehood, settlement of the western district bordering the <placeName>

                    people to life and demonstrating how the choices they made affected the eventual outcome and
                    development of the region.</p>
            <p>Although the book does not include endnotes and is meant primarily for a general and undergraduate
                    audience, there is a helpful essay on sources at the end of each chapter. Numerous illustrations and

            <p>Sociologist Douglas Harper has created a sensitive portrait of what he calls a "lost
                    agriculture," a cooperative, animal-powered, craft-based mode of farming that flourished in
                    the middle decades of the twentieth century and that has now been eclipsed by an individualistic,
                    industrialized farming. Echoing many critics of contemporary agriculture, he finds the
                    "changing works" culture superior to modern farming in many respects, especially
                    environmentally and socially. His is one more voice in a growing chorus of critics who call for a
                    reassessment of the direction being taken by today's corporate, increasingly large-scale
                    agriculture.</p>
            <p>Harper's methodology stems from the discipline of sociology, not history, so for historians
                    (this reviewer included) it is difficult to evaluate. Using such concepts as "photo
                    elicitation," he constructs "visual narratives" using the rich archive of
                    the Standard Oil of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> (SONJ) photo collection. (Though it is clear that the SONJ archive is superb, it is not
                    clear why only this collection was used.) The geographic focus is on the dairying country of
                    northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> State. Harper showed the SONJ photos to about a dozen people who began farming in the
                    1930s and subsequently lived through the transition, and asked them how the old system worked.</p>
            <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-099-1-071"/>
            <p>The result is captivating. The photos themselves are evocative pieces of art, and the
                    old-timers' explanations of the pictures make for fascinating reading. The give-and-take
                    between interviewees, often husband and wife, is also revealing. The combination of images,
                    transcribed interviews, and Harper's commentary shows how the "changing
                    works" system relied on cooperative labor. Small-scale dairying was diversified, and the
                    farm produced both animal feed and manure for the fields in a self-renewing cycle. The <hi rend="sup">'</hi>'craft<hi rend="sup">'</hi>' system
                    encompassed a universe of nuanced, detailed knowledge, from the quirks of individual animals to a
                    carefully gauged use of individual fields. While Harper clearly admires the old system more than the
                    new, he acknowledges the pitfalls of romanticizing the past, so he does not gloss over his
                    subjects' ambivalence about the hard work, the lack of gender parity, and the economic
                    struggle.</p>
            <p>He raises compelling questions about the cost of agricultural modernization. Innovations such as bulk
                    milk tanks, self-propelled corn choppers, free stall barns, and milking parlors eliminated limits on
                    herd size and reduced labor requirements. Dairy herds are bigger and more productive now (even as
                    consumption of dairy products has stagnated). Modern dairies are messier and smellier. Harper also
                    argues that modernization has been a factor in the rupture of neighborly social ties, the divorce of
                    food production from consumption, and a rise in pollution. It has intensified the accelerating
                    treadmill of deepening financial and time commitments for the farmers who remain. These are not new
                    observations, but they are stated here with special clarity.</p>
            <p>More attention to the impact of the New Deal would have been welcome; since many of these farmers
                    started out in the 1930s, it seems strange that New Deal programs do not enter into the discussion
                    at all. It would also have been instructive to examine more closely the impact of consumer culture,
                    as Hal Barron did in <hi rend="i">Mixed Harvest</hi> (1997). The book is marred throughout by
                    grammatical and spelling errors—a pity since otherwise it is beautifully produced.
                    Overall, though, this is a valuable work that explains much to a curious traveler passing through
                    any American dairying country. The landscape is changing fast, and this book helps explain why.</p>

            <p>Julius Wagner left Baden, Germany, in 1847 as part of a group known as the
                    "Darmstädters," or "The Forty," that established the
                    utopian community of Bettina in <placeName>

                    </placeName> based on communistic principles. <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-099-1-072"/> Julius's
                    brother Wilhelm followed him to the New World in 1851 in the wake of the 1848 revolutions that had
                    attempted but failed to reform German political and social life. Julius participated in one of the
                    attempts to achieve a utopian society in America, while Wilhelm founded a newspaper and printing
                    business in <placeName>

                    European and American social history.</p>
            <p>Andreas V. Reichstein found letters from members of the Wagner family while researching his 1981
                    book, <hi rend="i">The Rise of the Lone Star.</hi> This correspondence, other documents, and
                    interviews Reichstein conducted with family members cover the period from the beginning of the
                    migration process to the present state of the Wagner family. The work treats the hopes,
                    expectations, and the realities of migration. The author attempts to expand the subject of his work
                    beyond the stories of the two men themselves to the broader theme of acculturation and assimilation.</p>
            <p>Julius's life in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> is well documented, showing his participation in the intellectual history of the
                    communist movement and connections to the highest level of political thought in Germany. Very
                    interesting is the link to the Adelsverein founded by Count Solms-Braunfels, who purchased land to
                    establish a German settlement in the New World. As Reichstein provides an overview of life in early
                    German <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, it is clear that women had the hardest lot: Julius's wife Emilie appears from
                    her letters to have suffered from permanent culture shock.</p>
            <p>The contrast with the even more politically involved Wilhelm is useful in order to see the divergent
                    directions of two sibling immigrants and their families in the U.S. ARer participating in the failed
                    revolution of 1848, Wilhelm was persecuted for his involvement and was forced to emigrate. Wilhelm
                    remained more politically active also in the us.</p>
            <p>Subsequent generations of the family had much to contend with also. Anti-German feeling during World
                    War I forced the German-language newspaper founded by Wilhelm to close, but his descendants
                    developed a flourishing printing business. Their family ties to Germany loosened, as did ties
                    between the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> branches. However, the work ethic survived in both groups.</p>
            <p>Julius's great-grandson, the successful businessman Walter Paepcke, founded the Aspen, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cou">Colorado</region>
                    </placeName>, cultural center with its Bauhaus tradition. For its opening, Paepcke organized a grand
                    celebration of Goethe that attempted to reaffirm German humanism in the American context. Julius
                    Wagner's descendants maintained the German tie, including the language, since their
                    connection to Germany was to the high culture, not just to familiar forms of socializing. The other
                    branch of the family, Wilhelm's descendants, abandoned both their links to Germany and
                    language, assimilating to the American <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-099-1-073"/> mainstream. Both cousins
                    were successful businessmen in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>—one of them founded a hardware business that still operates. "They
                    contributed their social and ethnic backgrounds into this new society, thus changing it
                    too" (p. 204). Reichstein says that it is not a simple melting pot story: <quote>
                        <p>Assimilation and acculturation are not contradictory or exclusive terms. They rather describe
                            two ways of integrating</p>
                    </quote> (p. 205).</p>
            <p>Reichstein provides very extensive notes and bibliographic references. There is one error in the

            <p>This collection of twelve essays showcases some of the best work in journalism history. The range of
                    journals in which they originally appeared—from the <hi rend="i">Journal of American
                        History</hi> and <hi rend="i">American Quarterly</hi> to <hi rend="i">Communication
                    Research</hi> and <hi rend="i">Journalism Quarterly</hi>— attests to the breadth of ideas
                    they explore. Although David Paul Nord revised the essays only slightly (they were written between
                    the mid-1980s and mid-1990s) for <hi rend="i">Communities of Journalism</hi>, the introduction
                    grounds them in current scholarly literature.</p>
            <p>Nord looks at communication and community from two vantage points: how newspapers produce meaning,
                    and how readers comprehend that meaning. For both perspectives, context is the key. In
                    "Teleology and News: The Religious Roots of American Journalism, 1630-1730," he
                    emphasizes how the Puritans' understanding of divine providence colored seemingly secular
                    news reports. In "Working-Class Readers: Family, Community, and Reading in Late
                    Nineteenth-Century America," Nord shows how spending on printed matter varied with region,
                    ethnicity, and family structure, among other things.</p>
            <p>The readers figure centrally in all of Nord's essays, even those that emphasize production.
                    Journalism histories have traditionally featured accounts about publishers' intentions and,
                    at most, have made crude inferences about their readers. Nord, however, was among the first
                    journalism historians to consider seriously how readers perceived the printed matter they
                    encountered. These inquiries have <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-099-1-074"/> been influenced by studies of
                    literacy, history of the book, and literary scholars' reader-response theory. For data,
                    Nord has gleaned insights from lists of subscribers, readers' published letters,
                    readers' unpublished exchanges with editors, and census returns.</p>
            <p>Although Indiana does not figure directly in Nord's essays, four of his studies focus on
                    nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the 1870s to the Progressive era. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in fact, is his laboratory for exploring how metropolitan daily newspapers expressed
                    different conceptions of urban community. Some, such as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Times</hi>, saw cities as amalgamations of private
                    interests; accordingly, they reported a smorgasbord of disconnected news items. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Daily News</hi>, in contrast, practiced a style of journalism that emphasized the
                    interdependence of urban life. Nord links these varying editorial philosophies to
                    publishers' business strategies and, more importantly, to their involvement in municipal
                    reform. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as in other cities, reform movements fared best when at least one newspaper was
                    devoted to an idea of public community that emphasized collective interests.</p>
            <p>Almost without exception, the essays in <hi rend="i">Communities of Journalism</hi> attain a balance
                    that is rare in the scholarship of journalism history. The studies attend to the nuts and bolts of
                    newspaper production while also venturing outward to engage the big issues of social and cultural
                    history; they offer generalizations that would satisfy most social scientists, yet support them with
                    detail that is characteristic of a humanist's work; and they tell complex stories in a
                    precise, nuanced style that is never so subtle or technical that it confounds meaning.</p>

            <p>In a world in which celebrated performers such as Garth Brooks and Shania Twain dominate popular
                    perceptions of country musicians, students often forget to look past their glamour to recognize the
                    sources that gave rise to and sustained the country music tradition. In this study from the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Press, Bill C. Malone offers a new appreciation of a type of music often dismissed as
                    unrehed and redneck.</p>
            <p>Malone is certainly no novice in the world of country music. Not only is he an accomplished musician,
                    but he has devoted much of his life to understanding the meaning behind the music, and this volume
                        <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-099-1-075"/> may well be his finest interpretation to date. Students of
                    country music have long acknowledged the complex forces that underlie the melodies. Malone reveals
                    the diversities of "residence, religion, occupation, ethnicity, and even politics"
                    that characterize those who listen to country music (p. viii). Malone argues that the musicians and
                    their fans, far from being a monolithic group, may represent the wonderful diversity that serves as
                    one of America's greatest strengths better than their counterparts in any other art form.</p>
            <p>He skillfully analyzes the connection between the music and Protestant evangelicalism and the concept
                    of "rambling men," as well as the centrality of politics and dancing to the world
                    of country music. While he is careful to demonstrate that the genre is far from homogenous, he
                    reminds us that some consistent themes endure. Perhaps foremost among them is the schism between the
                    appeals of home life and Christian propriety versus the ecstasies of hedonism, a theme that
                    continues to be a central component of the music's appeal.</p>
            <p>Malone's research is as meticulous as his narrative is passionate. Readers are treated to
                    first-person recollections of many important figures from the past fifty years of musical
                    development. Malone does not merely report; his interpretation reveals a lifelong immersion in the
                    music's message, which began on a cotton tenant farm in Depression-era <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Billy Ray Cyrus.</p>
            <p>A comprehensive bibliographical essay along with a general index and a song-title index increase the
                    usefulness of this volume. Malone also includes photographs of famous country music performers. For
                    their fans and for students of the southern plain folk this book demands a careful reading. For
                    those who do not harbor an affection for country music, it is certain to stimulate a new
                    appreciation of a misunderstood art form.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> Gramm states that this book "is for any reader who thinks about
                    life," (p. xi) yet the 175 pages that follow seem to focus upon death. To be sure, death is
                    a part of life, and the soldiers and civilians who endured the Civil War came to know much about
                    both in the years 1861-1865. Gramm's selection <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-099-1-076"/> of
                    topics, poetry, and songs allows the reader to form a literary relationship with these people, whom
                    he calls "Somebody's Darlings." As he argues, "the more we
                    experience what the War was <hi rend="i">like</hi>, the more uncomfortable we should become, if we
                    are not depraved" (p. xiv). This was an unusual book to read, because it asks whether we
                    really can come to understand the emotions, passions, and deeds of people who lived in the Civil War
                    era.</p>
            <p>In any event, Gramm has assembled an array of interesting topics. In "The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Nobody Knows," we try to imagine Robert E. Lee, as well as others, as
                    somebody's darling beyond what Americans saw in the movie <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi> (1993). In his chapter "American Iliad," Gramm attempts to make the case
                    that we can only understand the Civil War in the context of "a larger world" (p.
                    48). He moves deftly to form literary images of the "Wilderness," both the battle
                    and the concept. In "The Real War," he targets the famed words of Walt Whitman,
                    showing how significant the romantic's characterization of war was and still is for
                    historians, including the modern-day Civil War scholar James McPherson. "Nothing but
                    Omnipotence" reminds us that there really is some truth to the old Soviet joke that while
                    the future is certain, the past is always unpredictable. The latter half of the book is devoted to
                    "A Soldier's Grave" and "A Soldier's Bones,"
                    which focus upon the combatant's imagination and how historians dispute the degree to which
                    we can understand him. In "Face to Face," Gramm discusses what the generation of
                    Civil War citizens has become for us.</p>
            <p>This volume emphasizes the relationship between the drama of the Civil War and its results, which
                    conjure up distinct historical features that we continue to reconceptualize and try to understand in
                    our modern day. There is much to ponder from reading this volume, and Civil War enthusiasts would
                    benefit greatly from taking a step away from traditional approaches to the conflict to gain the
                    different perspective of the war offered by Gramm's selections.</p>
            <p>Gramm's unique narrative is sure to please those looking for something beyond drums and
                    trumpets. It is to be hoped that his poetic prose in giving a voice to the unwritten aspects of the
                    war will attract the large reading audience <hi rend="i">Somebody's Darling</hi> so richly

                    1870-1900.</hi> By Linda E. Smeins. (Walnut Creek, Calif.: AltaMira Press, 1999. Pp. 335.
                    Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. Clothbound, $52.00; paperbound,
                    $24.95.)</head>
            <p>In her book <hi rend="i">Building an American Identity</hi> Linda E. Smeins sets out to explore the
                    evolution of pattern book designs for American homes in the last quarter of the nineteenth century,
                    to examine the <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-099-1-077"/> assertions in many pattern books that they were
                    providing "American" homes for their clients, to evaluate the extent to which
                    pattern books promoted development of idealized suburban homes for the middle class, and to
                    investigate the battle to influence architectural taste for the home-building public.</p>
            <p>The most compelling subject is that of the pattern book designs themselves and how they changed
                    between 1876 and 1900. Smeins shows the commanding influence exerted by the carpenter-builders who
                    published books providing line drawings of elevations and floor plans. They sold them to potential
                    homeowners and local builders who desired guidance on fashionable and practical designs. After the
                    Civil War, advances in printing, rail transportation links, and development of a consumer culture
                    led to an explosion in pattern book publications aimed both at the middle class and the working
                    class. The most popular publishers were Robert Shopell, the Palliser Brothers, and George F. Barber.</p>
            <p>Beginning in the 1870s, the Queen Anne style made its appearance in both the establishment journal
                        <hi rend="i">American Architect</hi> and in pattern books published by practicing architects
                    such as Henry Hudson Holly. Soon the nonarchitect majority of pattern book authors seized upon the
                    new fashion, and it became an exuberant, eclectic mixture of medieval and classical massing and
                    details. Despite efforts by the American Institute of Architects to shift popular taste to a
                    simplified house based on American colonial antecedents, the Queen Anne swept the country, bolstered
                    by multiple editions prepared by the pattern book authors.</p>
            <p>Smeins suggests that most of the market for Queen Anne houses was in suburbs, and this was certainly
                    true in the East. However, in the Midwest and West, these expansive houses appeared both in existing
                    cities and in small towns, in the houses of prosperous farmers, and in the countless new towns
                    developed in the Plains, Rocky Mountain West, and the West coast.</p>
            <p>Of greatest value to an Indiana reader will be Smeins's review of pattern book designs and
                    her careful explanation of changes in style. Those familiar with residences of the period in Hoosier
                    cities and towns will realize that pattern books, not local architects, were the source of many
                    well-known designs. Perhaps the book's primary contribution is to architectural history and
                    historic preservation, documenting the importance of pattern books as a source for house design and
                    exploring the changes that occurred in popular tastes in the late nineteenth century.</p>

            <p>Ask people today what the Salvation Army is, and you are bound to get a few stock answers. Most will
                    point out that the Army raises money for the poor, especially during Christmastime, when bellringing
                    members stand on city streetcorners to collect alms in red kettles. Others will recognize that the
                    Army commonly provides emergency shelter and social services for the urban homeless and, during
                    times of disaster, assumes a leading role in organizing public relief. Few, however, realize that
                    the Army is an urban religious movement whose history stretches back to the last part of the
                    nineteenth century and, more importantly, that originally it practiced few of the social roles that
                    so many associate with it today.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Hallelujah Lads &amp; Lasses</hi> Lillian Taiz undertakes the task of explaining
                    how the Army developed its modern identity. In a compact account of the first fifty years of the
                    history of the Salvation Army in America, Taiz argues two basic points. Her first is that the early
                    success of the Army lay in its ability to attract city laborers by appropriating aspects of street
                    theater and popular culture. Membership rolls swelled as Army officers crafted religious services
                    and outreach efforts that featured the boisterous parades, loud pageants, brass bands, maudlin
                    plays, and songs that constituted so much of the culture of leisure for poor people in cities.
                    Central to what Taiz calls the formation of this "working-class religious
                    institution" was also the distinctive opportunity for leadership and service provided to
                    women who joined the Army.</p>
            <p>By the beginning of the twentieth century, however, the character of the organization had changed
                    profoundly. Taiz's second major point is that the Army grew more restrained and focused on
                    a mission of social charity after the early 1900s. Seeking at once to respond to urban poverty by
                    creating programs to supply housing, jobs, and food and to appear more respectable to middle-class
                    politicians, the Army's officers reordered their priorities: money and time were to be
                    devoted to constructing long-term reform efforts, while church services and evangelical efforts were
                    to become more disciplined. Gone was much of the earlier emphasis on winning souls for Christ by
                    emulating popular entertainment. The ultimate result, Taiz maintains, was the Salvation Army known
                    by so many today: a philanthropic institution largely shorn of its roots in working-class culture.</p>
            <p>Taiz offers a fine portrait of the Salvation Army's evolution, but she leaves several
                    important questions hanging. The first is about the relationship between the Army and practices of
                    race. Taiz notes that the movement was unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining African Americans;
                    at one point she implies that the problem, in the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was a function of housing segregation (pp. 20-21). <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-099-1-079"/>
                    In another instance she writes that, unlike the Army, the Azusa Street revival, a
                    turn-of-the-century biracial Pentecostal movement, successfully incorporated physical aspects of
                    popular theater (p. 163). One wonders whether the Army was like other urban reform movements that
                    practiced subtle forms of racial discrimination or understood "respectability" as
                    a privilege of white citizens.</p>
            <p>A second question is how the range of modern technologies increasingly available to urban religious
                    entrepreneurs in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries affected the organization. Much
                    of the inventiveness of Taiz's book comes from her effort to show how the Army drew from a
                    marketplace of religious ideas and forms; one wonders how Army leaders responded to growth of radio
                    and the railroad and to changes in print and photographic technologies. Similarly, one wants to know
                    more about why the Salvation Army came to avoid popular entertainment when other successful
                    evangelicals seeking middle-class audiences — Carry Nation and Billy Sunday, for
                    example— embraced its methods. Still, Taiz offers scholarly and general readers alike a
                    compelling and valuable portrait of the Salvation Army and more generally of urban revivalism.</p>

            <p>According to Susan Schulten, the American view of the world changed drastically in the twentieth
                    century. There were a number of reasons for this: the nation moved gradually from isolationism to
                    interventionism from the time of the Spanish-American War to the Second World War; maps and atlases
                    became widely available with changing cartographic technology; the <hi rend="i">National Geographic

                    patterns. One institution that did not contribute greatly to the escape from "geographic
                    isolation" was the Association of American Geographers (AAG), the organization of academic
                    geographers founded in 1904, which was, according to Schulten, elitist and devoted to environmental
                    determinism until after World War II.</p>
            <p>The revolution in the mental map of Americans came about only after cartographers abandoned the
                    Mercator map projection, which portrayed America as protected behind the moat of a gigantic <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-099-1-080"/> world sea comprising the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans.
                    It was only in the late 1930s that Rand McNally, America's major mapmaker, and the National
                    Geographic Society cautiously abandoned the Mercator projection for others that represented the size
                    of these seas more realistically. American involvement in World War II brought with it innovative
                    maps in popular magazines and newspapers in the early 1940s created by George Renner at Rand McNally
                    and Richard Edes Harrison, who placed the North Pole and Arctic Ocean at the center of maps as a
                    "new mediterranean," which illustrated North America's spatial proximity
                    to and interdependence with Europe and Asia. Thus, a revolution in the geographical imagination, as
                    well as global events, prepared the American public for a new habit of internationalism after 1945.
                    Fear of Soviet expansionism reinforced the sense of North America's geographic
                    vulnerability in the aviation age with the onset of the Cold War in the late 1940s.</p>
            <p>Schulten uses an abundance of maps and photographs to enhance her argument. My only reservation about
                    the book is her characterization of the AAG as Social Darwinist and elitist. There is truth in this,
                    but there were voices among this group (those of J. Russell Smith and Isaiah Bowman, e.g.) arguing
                    the importance of environmental influence (ecology) and rejecting the crude determinism of Ellen

            <p>In his novel <hi rend="i">Nineteen Nineteen</hi>, John Dos Passos wrote that Woodrow Wilson
                    "strained every nerve of his body and brain" during the fight over the League of
                    Nations. According to John Milton Cooper, Jr., in his exhaustively researched and well-written
                    analysis of these events, Wilson's health is the key to understanding how the fight ended,
                    with the Senate rejecting membership in the nascent international organization. Following the
                    interpretations of physician Edwin A. Weinstein and Arthur Link, Cooper argues convincingly that
                    even before Wilson's stroke in October 1919, his poor health affected his performance in
                    the fight. The neurological and psychological effects of the stroke made any compromise problematic,
                    if not impossible. The "cerebrovascular accident" made him obstinate and resistant
                    to a modus vivendi, whereas in the early years of his administration he had shown a facility for
                    compromise. Ironically, as Wilson's physical <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-099-1-081"/> health
                    improved, his handling of the League fight deteriorated; he experienced moments of
                    "euphoria" that convinced him he had greater power than he did, and he then issued
                    bombastic statements precluding compromise.</p>
            <p>The struggle revolved around Article X of the League covenant, which imposed, according to Wilson, a
                    "moral obligation" on member nations to uphold the territorial integrity and
                    political independence of other members. Senate Republicans, whether "strong" or
                    "mild" reservationists, wanted that provision attenuated so as not to limit
                    America's sovereignty. The Irreconcilables wanted nothing to do with the League, with or
                    without Article X. To Wilson, Article X was the heart of the covenant; to weaken it was to
                    eviscerate the League. From the president's viewpoint, the only way to secure peace was
                    through collective security, whereas the GOP reservationists stressed pursuing great-power
                    nationalism, strengthening international law, and establishing a world court. With the parties so
                    far apart, Cooper rightfully questions whether compromise was possible.</p>
            <p>The factions and characters in the fight are well described by Cooper: Wilson, taking his case to the
                    American people in his fateful speaking tour of 1919; Henry Cabot Lodge, willing to contemplate
                    joining the League but concerned foremost with protecting the prerogatives of the legislature and
                    keeping Republicans united; and William E. Borah, the leading Irreconcilable, making eloquent and
                    learned appeals that America should preserve tradition and avoid involvement with Old World rows
                    that would lead the country to perdition.</p>
            <p>According to Cooper, the League fight was the greatest debate on foreign policy in the twentieth
                    century— nothing comparable has happened since— and he commends
                    Wilson's effort to try to educate the public on the issues. Though Cooper laments that
                    there has been little effort by politicians since then to enlighten the public on foreign policy,
                    this is hardly the case. There was a "great debate" in the early 1950s on the
                    nature of America's Cold War commitment, and another occurred during the Vietnam War. Of
                    course, there has been little debate over America's role in the world since the end of the
                    Cold War, with the consensus being on the side of interventionism and only isolated voices on the
                    left and right expressing doubts. This is in stark contrast to the national dispute that occurred
                    after World War I.</p>
            <p>I have one other criticism of an otherwise excellent book: the author is too much on the side of the
                    internationalists of the twentieth century and dismisses too readily the isolationists'
                    prescient view that, by becoming entangled in the disputes of the Old World, the United States
                    risked distorting its own republican institutions. This is a danger today as well. To uphold
                    worldwide commitments that internationalists have coaxed Americans into accepting, the state has
                    become ever larger and more powerful and thus susceptible to Lord Acton's dictum that
                    "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-099-1-082"/> corrupts
                    absolutely"— a fact that would break the hearts of the Founding Fathers.</p>

            <p>With painstaking attention to ethnic, gender, and class dynamics, and utilizing rich archival and
                    oral history sources, Laurie Mercier has produced a finely written and richly excavated study of the
                    century-long relationship between the powerful Anaconda Copper Mining Company (ACM) and the local
                    working-class community it helped create. Mercier examines community unionism in this company town
                    as it turned into a "union city" and later aspired to become a deindustrialized
                    tourist Mecca. Though Mercier covers the full history of Anaconda, from its rise in the
                    1880s— fulfilling the ambitions of smelter-builder Marcus Daly— to the final
                    closure of the world's largest smelting operation in 1980, her focus is on the post-World
                    War II period and on community unionism.</p>
            <p>Community unionism at Anaconda was characterized both by a strong sense of equality and justice and
                    by discriminatory gender and racial attitudes that ran deep through Anaconda's white ethnic
                    and mostly Catholic population. Mercier is highly sensitive to how gender affected working-class
                    community-building and to the obstacles that gender discrimination created for the
                    community's unions, especially Local 117 of the International Union of Mine, Mill, and
                    Smelter Workers (IUMMSW).</p>
            <p>Mercier admirably combines an analysis of such varied topics as foodways, holidays, leisure, domestic
                    abuse, parental authority, juvenile delinquency, schools, masculinity, and environmental politics
                    with more traditional union, business, community, and institutional history. She merges her various
                    levels of analysis elegantly and judiciously: the defeat of the left-leaning IUMMSW in 1959 is
                    credited in part to the "elevation of masculinity" and the exclusion of women from
                    union affairs (hence the rise of a women-dominated anti-red campaign as early as the 1940s); the
                    anticommunist movement of the Cold War era is linked to religious conservatism and anxieties about
                    family disintegration; unionism begins to erode in the 1950s in part because of growing emphasis on
                    disposable income, consumer goods, and leisure.</p>
            <p>The coming of the Cold War eroded Anaconda's working-class community and ethos as
                    competition between the IUMMSW— expelled from the Congress of Industrial Organizations
                    (CIO) for its left-leaning politics in 1950— and the CIO's United Steel Workers
                    of <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-099-1-083"/> America divided the community's workers for two
                    decades. Yet the coup de grace came in the late 1970s, and most dramatically in September 1980, when
                    the smelter's new owner, the Atlantic Richfield Corporation (ARCO) regained ACM's
                    Chilean mines, a profitable alternative to Anaconda and Butte copper. Unwilling to invest in its now
                    inefficient and outdated Anaconda facility (made so by years of poor management under ACM), trying
                    to escape what it considered onerous environmental regulations, and obtaining favorable tax
                    treatments for a plant shutdown, ARCO finally announced the closure of the smelter.</p>
            <p>Mercier's account of the rise and fall of community unionism in Anaconda is well written,
                    well researched, and well argued. My one regret lies in the book's failure to exploit its
                    oral history sources more thoroughly. Women's voices, so central to many of
                    Mercier's arguments, are sparsely quoted. Moreover, though the book concentrates heavily on
                    the Cold War years, Anaconda's left is surprisingly mute. We learn about anticommunists and
                    defenders of the IUMMSW, but the author says little about local socialists, communists, and
                    "fellow travelers." The author also neglects Anaconda's corporate elite.
                    Though Mercier does not want to "personalize the corporation or demonize its
                    managers"— preferring instead to make the greater point that the company was
                    merely following the logic of domestic and international capitalism— it would have been
                    useful to hear the voices of local and distant corporate managers pondering the economic fate of
                    this community (and not merely in press releases or public speeches).</p>
            <p>Still, this book is a very strong one; it is a wonderful trek through post-World War II western
                    industrial and labor history, a territory still little explored by scholars. Its rich evidentiary
                    foundations and incisively crafted arguments make it a joy to read, and its subtle synthesis of
                    various levels of analysis— domestic, community, institutional, national, and
                    international— constitutes an instructional manual of sorts for writing the history of
                    the twentieth-century industrial American West.</p>

            <p>What is a historical society? How has it evolved? What are its characteristics? Where is it headed in
                    this new century? Whose history should it preserve? Using the Historical Society of Pennsylvania as
                        <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-099-1-084"/> a case study, Sally F. Griffith delves into the history of
                    one of America's most prestigious historical societies in an attempt to answer those
                    questions.</p>
            <p>This is not the first time that the historical society world has been dissected for historical or
                    scientific reasons: Griffith's book joins two recent studies— Kevin

                    (1996)— both of them funded by the Mellon Foundation in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Their stories are pretty much identical: they tell of elitist, Caucasian clubs of
                    founding families, peopled by avaricious acquirers of objects, documents, and materials of the early
                    days of the republic, to which no real "professional" care was given. The leaders
                    of these societies undertook unfettered buying, selling, and dealing with no oversight and no
                    ethical standards. Indeed, many of the great collections of this country and in Europe were founded
                    with plunder from other countries.</p>
            <p>The late Susan Stitt, a long-time advocate of professional care of collections and prudent
                    management, took office as the first President of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in January
                    1990. Over an eight-year period she moved the society from its deficit mode into a modern
                    "corporate" model. The changes sometimes prompted resistance from the old
                    leadership. When Stitt insisted on the title of "President," Griffith writes, the
                    board acceded and then "separated membership in the Society from the responsibility of
                    choosing the Board and its officers" (p. 403). When the members got wind of their
                    disenfranchisement, they voted the measure down. The episode showed both the board's
                    isolation from the society's membership and, in the words of one dissenting board member,
                    "'mistrust … [of] the Society's leadership'"
                    (p. 403). (A similar skirmish recently played itself out at the Indiana Historical Society, with the
                    result of power remaining with the members of the Society.)</p>
            <p>Griffith' s book is a welcome scholarly addition to the literature on nonprofit, museum, and
                    historical society management, and stands in contrast to more popular renditions of the museum
                    field, such as Thomas Hoving's <hi rend="i">Making the Mummies Dance</hi> (19931, an
                    entertaining account by the former impresario of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. One wonders,
                    however, how much general appeal it will have beyond the world of museum professionals. It should be
                    read by every museum director and trustee in the country, but beyond that is it too much
                    "inside baseball"? Much of the book recounts the inner dealings of the institution
                    as it moves from one phase to the next and, to an insider, the stories are not only fascinating but
                    recall earlier situations and colleagues in similar scenarios.</p>
            <p>The most important chapter is the last. Entitled "Epilogue: The Predicament of Early

                    World it neatly summarizes the global issues facing the museum/historical society field. The author
                    links together and summarizes the questions posed above. Whose history is it, where are historical
                    societies headed, how have they evolved, and more importantly than ever, are they dinosaurs in a
                    twenty-first century world? These are not rhetorical but real questions faced by museum and
                    historical administrators on a daily basis. These institutions no longer resemble the cabinets of
                    curiosities whence they came. The political and economic realities associated with today's
                    evolving environment have radically changed the meaning of "historical society."
                    Those who awaken to "relevance" too slowly will not survive. Those who do survive
                    will operate institutions that bear little resemblance to their ancestors of the Victorian period.</p>

                    inauguration. Drawing on the William Henry Harrison Papers Project at the Indiana Historical

                    other regional repositories, Stevens's book is the first place to which any student of

                    Indianan who rose to national political prominence in the antebellum era.</p>
