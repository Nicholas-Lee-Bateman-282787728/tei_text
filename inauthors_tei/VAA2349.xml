                    <byline>BY HON. EX-EDITUR CALE FLUHART</byline>
                    <p>
                        <figure entity="VAA2349-1"/> A grand marshal is a fellow who is not strong enough politically to
                        pull down a deputy game wardenship, but who possesses all the essential qualities of a gilt
                        edged general or a fiery rear-admiral. Grand marshals come in all shapes and <pb
                            id="VAA2349-006" n="2"/> sizes, but a first class A No. I grand marshal weighs 250 pounds,
                        clips his head and wears a stiff, drooping mustache that not only gives him the appearance of
                        being a man who is quick to act, but also serves as a dandy little soup strainer. He retires on
                        the evening preceding the day he is to scintilate at the usual hour and gets up in the morning
                        with the milk men and jumps into his glossy black suit and shines his boots with stove polish.
                        After worrying down a heavy breakfast, the grand marshal summons his wife, and then the work of
                        adjusting his red oiled muslin sash begins. At 6 o&apos;clock he is in the saddle and by
                        6:30 he has four drinks under his sash. By 8 o&apos;clock he is pickled. It does not make
                        any difference to a regular grand marshal what hour the festivities of the day are to begin. All
                        he wants to know is the day and date. Rushing madly up and down the main <pb id="VAA2349-007"
                            n="[3]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2349-2"/>
                        <pb id="VAA2349-008" n="4"/> streets, the grand marshal personally supervises the arrangement of
                        bunting and flags, drives the peanut and hot sausage venders nearer the courthouse fence and
                        pushes the prominent citizens back of the dead line.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Git back, stand back, everybody, git back!!!&quot; cries the grand marshal from 6
                        A. M. till the livery stable closes. Little children hate a grand marshal. It&apos;s no
                        uncommon thing for a man or woman to point out some old decrepit man and say, &quot;Curse
                        that old geezer! Away with him! He was a grand marshal when I was a child.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If the town is dry, a grand marshal drinks in a box stall. If it is wet, he drinks in the saddle
                        at the handiest side door.</p>
                    <p>A grand marshal is a great spectaclebut he should be viewed from the belfry of the courthouse
                        where his maneuvers may be watched with impunity, beyond the reach of his breath and hickory
                        cane.</p>

                        <figure entity="VAA2349-5"/> An amateur actor is a fellow who can not act. He is ready and
                        willing to act, and often looks like he could act, but he can not.</p>
                    <p>Every town supports at least one amateur actor. It has to, for after the amateur actor gets a
                        whiff of the footlights and a complimentary puff in the home weekly he at once becomes
                        disqualified for further usefulness and loafs from one local entertainment to the next.</p>

                    <p>In appearance an amateur actor does not differ materially from a high school teacher or a
                        saddler. Occasionally there is one with an ashen pallor and black curly hair and eyes like a
                        locomotive engineer who has washed up hurriedly after a long, smoky run. But the average amateur
                        actor would not cause more than passing notice should he be seen leaning on the town pump or
                        stepping into the postoffice.</p>
                    <p>It doesn&apos;t make a particle of difference to an amateur actor what play is up for
                        rehearsal. He is long on memorizing, and &quot;Don Caesar,&quot; &quot;William
                        Tell,&quot; &quot;The Naiad Queen&quot; or &quot;The Pirates of
                        Penzance&quot; all look alike to him. He can sing a balled, or will sing one whether he can
                        or not, and jump at the chance to do a Highland fling. The only time he ever has stage fright is
                        when the theater threatens to burn the day before he expects to &quot;act.&quot;</p>

                    <p>An amateur actor always speaks of Julia Marlowe as just plain Marlowe, and swears that he
                        can&apos;t see how Bob Mantell gets by. Nothing pleases an amateur actor quite so much as to
                        have someone ask him why he <pb id="VAA2349-021" n="17"/> never adopted the stage as a
                        profession. If his mother is alive it&apos;s because she wants him at home. But if she is

                    <head>THE VILLAGE SPORT</head>
                    <byline>BY PINKY KERR</byline>
                    <p>
                        <figure entity="VAA2349-7"/> The fifteen ball pool, or common variety, of village sport gets up
                        at 9 o&apos;clock in the morning. After he nibbles about the pantry for five or ten minutes
                        he places a smoothing iron on the kitchen stove and rolls a few &quot;pills&quot; and
                        arranges his itinerary for the day. After the iron has reached the <pb id="VAA2349-025" n="21"/>
                        proper temperature, the task of pressing a fierce, razor edged crease in his trousers is on, his
                        whole soul entering into the work. Then he retires to his room and slicks up, after which he
                        borrows a quarter from his mother. This ends his business worries for the day, and he hurries to
                        Mack&apos;s Place, where he is at once the envy of all the geeks.</p>
                    <p>If the pool variety of sport happens to have a sister who is working he leaves a call for an
                        earlier hour, that he may touch her for a half before she starts for the catsup factory or the
                        Elite millinery parlors.</p>
                    <p>The dandy little wizard of the spherical ivories can swing more business with a few nickels than
                        a Hunyak grade builder. His on-and-off layout consists of two foxy &quot;special to-day
                        only&quot; suits of loud design and doubtful texture, cut very loose and enlivened with a
                        peck of pearl-faced buttons, <pb id="VAA2349-026" n="22"/> together with a few non-equipment
                        accessories.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, a village ne&apos;er-do-well, of the ball and cue sort, has not infrequently copped
                        out the pride of the hamlet with nothing to commend him but his wiry bangs and a cotton and wood
                        fiber suit of purplish cast, thereby coming into a rich slice of a productive farm or a
                        flourishing title mill. Of course he has to be careful and not let the sun hit his clothes or
                        the match would be a blow off.</p>
                    <p>In our underweight, or oiled street towns, there are many varieties of the E-flat sport besides
                        the one that lolls in the whittled chairs of the pool bazar. There&apos;s the craps shooting
                        sport that hangs about the livery, feed and sale stable and smells like a goat; the buggy riding
                        sport that works up to a narrow rig with yellow running gears, the one with the blue bow on his
                        whip, who <pb id="VAA2349-027" n="23"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2349-8">

                        <pb id="VAA2349-028" n="24"/> haunts the quiet country lanes every Sunday with a rosy-faced
                        belle in a wilted lawn dress, a drooping hat and runover heels; the leaning sport with the
                        yellow strings of his tobacco bag dangling from his hip pocket, who does nothing worse than
                        polish the corner of the People&apos;s Bank; the fancy shirt sport, that has consented to
                        clerk and swings on the awning ropes and kids the schoolgirls when he is not crossing the street
                        to the postoffice or sprinkling the sidewalk; and the last, but not least, the Stop 9 sport, who
                        stands by the milk cans and looks pretty when the interurban car whizzes by.</p>
                    <p>The one obstacle between the average pump-and-trough town sport and work is his mother. She
                        thinks he&apos;s the goods. However, you never see him hanging around his father.</p>

                    <p>Th&apos; principal trouble with folks that&apos;ll pay if they&apos;ve got it is that
                        they git things without havin&apos; it.</p>

                    <p>It might help th&apos; consumer t&apos; take a more cheerful view o&apos; life if
                        th&apos; butcher would let th&apos; meat stay on th&apos; scales long enough

                    <p>Th&apos; feller that won&apos;t pay anythin&apos; believes in treatin&apos;

                    <p>Nobuddy works as hard fer his money as th&apos; feller that marries it.</p>
                    <p>Money talks, an&apos; when some fellers spend it, it fairly yells.</p>
                    <p>Th&apos; latest menace is th&apos; feller that smokes th&apos; band on a nickel
                        se-gar.</p>
                    <p>A feller asked fer a money order at th&apos; pustoffice at Crawfordsville, th&apos; other
                        day, an&apos; when th&apos; pustmaster asked him fer how much, he said, &quot;Oh, a

                        Tipton Bud.</p>
                    <p>I wonder how long most fellers would stick t&apos; a secret order if it wuzn&apos; fer
                        th&apos; gold braid?</p>

                    <p>A pessimist is a feller that bought a set o&apos; Dickens once fer twenty-five cents down

                    <p>Writin&apos; is gittin&apos; t&apos; be &apos;bout as cheap as talk.</p>

                        patent gates.</p>
                    <p>Even th&apos; fact that alderberries require very little sugar don&apos;t seem
                        t&apos; stimulate th&apos; demand.</p>

                    <p>Many a feller has gone broke trustin&apos; Providence.</p>
                    <p>Lafe Bud has a new ten dollar frock suit an&apos; he looks like a country prosecutor,
                        &apos;cept his hair is cut.</p>

                        had been pendin&apos; fer years.</p>

                        hold hands with a young man you&apos;ve only met once.</p>

                    <p>Disobligin&apos; people allus hold positions that anybuddy in th&apos; world could fill.</p>
                    <p>Th&apos; feller that rushes in generally crawls out.</p>
                    <p>Fer ever&apos; feller that goes in th&apos; chicken business one fails.</p>
                    <p>Th&apos; feller that fails in th&apos; East would starve in th&apos; West.</p>
                    <p>It&apos;s better t&apos; have loved an&apos; lost than try t&apos; pick out a
