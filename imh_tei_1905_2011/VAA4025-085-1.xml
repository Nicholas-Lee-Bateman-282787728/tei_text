            <p>Had it not been for the famine of 1921, it is unlikely that James P. Goodrich, Indiana's
                    retiring Republican governor, would ever have visited Russia. Having just completed a rather unhappy
                    four-year term as chief executive, it was Goodrich's intention to return to his banking
                    business at Winchester, Indiana, and never again play a public role. Instead, he was unexpectedly
                    asked by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover to help supervise the Russian operations of the
                    American Relief Administration. His four trips to Russia turned Goodrich into an enthusiastic
                    admirer of the long-suffering Russian people. "I like the Russian people," he
                    wrote a friend, "they are so much like our own folks."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Optimistically, in reality too optimistically, Goodrich concluded that Russia, as a result of
                    Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's New Economic Policy, was embarking upon the road to capitalism.
                    Unlike most contemporary observers, however, Goodrich saw clearly that the revolution was an
                    accomplished fact with which the West had to come to terms sooner or later. His recommendation,
                    which he offered calmly and unemotionally to the Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge
                    administrations, was that America should extend diplomatic recognition to Moscow and restore
                    Soviet-American trade. At the time he was often regarded as a man who had lost touch with reality,

                    his entire lifetime when he agreed with a Democrat was in 1933 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt
                    exchanged ambassadors with the Soviet Union, an action which substantially vindicated Goodrich.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>James Putnam Goodrich was born at Winchester, Indiana, on February 18, 1864. He was the third of five
                    sons born to John and Elizabeth Goodrich, but he had little recollection of his father, who died of
                    tuberculosis when James was only eight years old. Considering the modest economic circumstances of
                    his youth, Goodrich was probably lucky to have graduated from high school. Among the nine graduates
                    in his class at Winchester High School were James E. Watson, later a Republican <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> representative and senator; John R. Commons, who became a prominent economist at the
                    University of Wisconsin; and Cora Frist, whom Goodrich married in 1888. He attended DePauw
                    University for two years but did not graduate, nor did he have a law degree although he passed the
                    bar examination after reading law in the office of Enos Watson, the father of his high school
                    classmate. Thereafter Goodrich became financially successful as an attorney, as the receiver of the
                    Chicago, Cincinnati and Louisville Railroad, and as president of the People's Loan Company
                    at Winchester.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Republican politics, not business, was Goodrich's real calling. In his uncompleted
                    autobiography, written in 1938-1939 for his son Pierre, Goodrich devoted just 28 pages to his
                    childhood and education and 160 pages to his political career. In 1897 Goodrich was elected county
                    chairman for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Randolph County</region>
                    </placeName>, and from 1901 to 1909 he served as Republican state chairman. "I might say
                    without egotism here," he rather egotistically wrote in his autobiography, "that
                    from that time on down until 1921, the general policy of the Republican party so far as the
                    organization was concerned was directed by me." Organizing, not speechmaking, was his
                    strong point, and for many years he was content to remain in the political background and showed no
                    interest in seeking elective office. Goodrich always regarded himself as a liberal Republican, an
                    assessment which was accurate enough from an Indiana, if not from a national, perspective. In 1912,
                    reflecting his sense of loyalty to the Republican organization, he discreetly supported William

                    mind about running for public office and decided to seek the governorship. To cover his campaign
                    expenses he wrote a personal check for $40,000; and with the assistance of Will H. Hays,
                    "the best publicity man that ever lived," Goodrich easily carried the election
                    while condemning the Democrats for excessive state spending.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As an experienced politician heading a united party and having control of both houses of the
                    legislature, Goodrich should have been a successful governor. To his shock he found himself the
                    target of unexpected backstabbing by his fellow Republicans. "It was a strange situation in
                    which I found myself," he recalled. "The men who had been associated with party
                    politics ever since 1900 complimented me during the campaign on the promises made and almost
                    invariably said that it was ‘good stuff.’ But after my inauguration, they
                    began to express grave doubts as to the wisdom and political expediency of so many new and unusual
                    things." First of all, Goodrich was thwarted by senators of "small mind and narrow
                    vision" when he proposed an excise tax on corporate property in order to equalize the state
                    tax burden between agriculture and industry. The governor was also frustrated when he sought to
                    abolish the Indiana Oil Inspection Department on the ground that there was no work for it to
                    perform. Even more discouraging was that much of his time as governor was spent in the hospital. In
                    August, 1917, he was seriously ill with typhoid fever. Then, soon after his recovery, his car was
                    struck by a truck, and Goodrich spent several more months in the hospital with fractures of the hip,
                    skull, ribs, collarbone, and left hand. For the rest of his life Goodrich walked with a cane.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Goodrich was undoubtedly in earnest when, in the final year of his term, he
                    wrote Senator Harry S. New: "I have no desire or ambition to do anything but finish my
                    administration as best I can and then go back to my business. I am done with politics for ever and a
                    day." And, with only two months remaining as governor, he wrote a friend: "I will
                    be the happiest man in Indiana when the tenth day of January comes and I can once more be free.
                    Never again will I even think of rendering any service to the people in an official
                        capacity."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Goodrich's retirement coincided with the catastrophic Russian famine which swept the Ukraine
                    and the Volga region in 1921. A combination of drought, civil war, and foreign intervention led to
                    the destruction of even seed grain and draft animals, and numerous cases of cannibalism were
                    recorded. According to a British estimate, thirty-five million people were starving to death. A
                    famous appeal for aid by the writer Maxim Gorky made the world aware of the Russians'
                    plight. Secretary of Commerce Hoover, speaking for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, signified his willingness to organize a program of famine relief. Hoover had already
                    earned an international reputation as a humanitarian for his relief activities in Belgium during
                    World War I. During the Paris Peace Conference he had headed the American Relief Administration, an
                    official agency that had distributed food supplies on credit to war-torn Europe. Once the war was
                    over, the ARA remained in existence in New York as a private organization with close ties to the
                    American government, and Hoover continued to serve as chairman.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Selecting personnel for the Russian relief program was Hoover's first step. To head the
                    operation he chose Colonel William N. Haskell, who had previously supervised ARA operations in
                    Roumania and Armenia. Goodrich's name was first mentioned to Hoover by Postmaster General
                    Will H. Hays of Indiana following a Cabinet meeting. Hoover responded enthusiastically and suggested
                    to Hays that he would like to send Goodrich to Russia as "one of the important divisional
                    heads" under Haskell. "I believe it would be of substantial benefit to this
                    country," wrote Hoover, "to have a man of such experience as Governor Goodrich
                    obtain a real knowledge of what the real difficulties of this foolish economic system are."
                    Goodrich, who was vacationing in New York, was highly flattered by the suggestion, which was
                    conveyed to him by Hays, and wrote his friend that he felt he could get his financial affairs in
                    order if he were definitely asked to go. Hoover then responded with a telegram asking Goodrich to
                    come to Washington "to discuss [the] Russian situation." After a brief interview
                    with "the Chief" and Haskell, Goodrich agreed to go to Russia "with an
                    open mind to investigate the entire famine situation, learn the truth about Russia and return as
                    soon as the preliminary investigation was completed." Officially Goodrich served the ARA as
                    a "special investigator." No salary went with the imposing title, although he was
                    compensated for his travel expenses.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>On the surface Goodrich was not very well qualified for such a mission. His entire experience had
                    been in the world of business and domestic politics. Although he was not an isolationist, his
                    knowledge of foreign policy was slight; and he possessed only the most rudimentary information about
                    Russia's history, geography, and culture. Goodrich readily admitted, "I had never
                    been in Russia and I knew nothing about the country of the Great Bear excepting what I had learned
                    at school and what I had read since in the American newspapers and magazines."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Yet, in a sense, his lack of preparation was an advantage in that he undertook
                    his mission without holding intense anti-Soviet convictions (with the exception that Goodrich, like
                    most westerners, regarded the communist economic system to be contrary to human nature).
                    Demonstrating a rather youthful curiosity, he saw his position with the ARA as an opportunity to
                    combine a worthwhile humanitarian service with a last great adventure.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> At age
                    fifty-seven, having achieved financial security and having attained all he desired in politics,
                    Goodrich was at peace with himself and politically obligated to no one, Hoover included. He took
                    literally Hoover's request that he approach the subject with an open mind and returned with
                    some unexpected conclusions.</p>
            <p>Three weeks were required for Goodrich to reach Moscow. First he traveled with his wife on the liner
                        <hi rend="i">Kroonland</hi> to England where he met briefly with ARA officials. His route then
                    took him across the channel and by train through France, Germany, and Lithuania to the Russian
                    frontier. It was immediately apparent to Goodrich that he had entered a different and more primitive
                    world. Along the railroad he observed women working side by side with men as section hands. The
                    station at the border was "dirty, cold, ill-smelling, and absolutely unlighted."
                    Yet, in his first encounter with the Russian people, Goodrich found himself strangely attracted to
                    the <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">10</hi> As a general rule Goodrich was not inclined toward introspection;
                            moreover, his Russian visit was arranged in such haste that he had little time or energy to
                            spend on self-analysis. When one considers his correspondence with Hays and Hoover, his
                            diary entries, and his later writings about Russia, however, it is clear that Goodrich was
                            highly flattered to have been selected to make the trip for the ARA. At the same time, he
                            was naturally apprehensive about his personal safety and physical comfort while traveling in
                            a country ruled by the Bolsheviks. At London, according to his diary for September 29, 1921,
                            he purchased a winter outfit that was sufficient "to go to the North Pole if the
                            Bolskeviki don't get it all." And it was probably worry that led Goodrich
                            to record on September 27 that he was not sleeping well. James P. Goodrich diary, September
                            27, 29, 1921, Goodrich Papers. Nevertheless, his sense of anxiety was overshadowed by a
                            feeling that he was about to undertake a journey of unique personal, political, and
                            historical significance. Throughout his first and later trips to Russia, Goodrich took pains
                            to make daily entries in a compact traveler's diary with the intention of
                            publishing a book about his experiences. He began this project in 1922 but abandoned it
                            after completing a first draft of three hundred pages.</item>

                    in a strange tongue not a word of which I could understand." At a private home near the
                    depot he was served a "very good dinner" consisting of a sour soup, potatoes,
                    fish, meat, black bread, and beer, for which he was charged the equivalent of sixteen cents.
                    Twenty-four hours later, on October 6, 1921, Goodrich finally arrived in Moscow only to discover
                    that no one was there to meet him because the telegram he had sent announcing his arrival had never
                    been delivered. Soon he was established at ARA headquarters in "the Pink House"
                    and after dinner seized the opportunity to take a bath.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After two days Goodrich was able to secure first class accommodations on the train to Samara in the
                    drought-stricken Volga region. The plan was for the governor to be accompanied by Professor Frank A.
                    Golder of Stanford University, George Repp (an ARA employee), and a Russian interpreter. If possible
                    Goodrich and his party hoped to link up with Haskell who was on his own inspection tour of the
                    Volga. Had Goodrich based his opinion of Russia solely upon the primitive travel conditions
                    encountered during his first trip to the Volga, he could justifiably have thrown up his hands in
                    despair and vowed never to return. At Moscow the train was advertised to leave at 10:00 p.m. but on
                    short notice left at 1:30 p.m. instead. In the confusion the interpreter and Repp, who had all
                    "the grub," were left behind. Fortunately Golder, who had been born in Russia and
                    was an experienced and resourceful traveler, rose to the occasion. Soon he had foraged cheese and
                    bologna sandwiches made of black bread. For breakfast Goodrich and Golder dined on millet bread and
                    raw turnips which they washed down with pumpkin rind tea. "At a little way
                    station," noted Goodrich, "Dr. Golder jumped off the train returning in a few
                    minutes with a roast chicken on which we dined in the evening." To pass the time the two
                    played poker, the first of many such games, with Goodrich emerging victorious by 120,000 rubles (the
                    equivalent of $1.20).<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon reaching the Volga, Goodrich's first impression was that the reports of famine were
                    "greatly exaggerated." A casual walk through the streets and bazaars of Samara,
                    Simbirsk, Kazan, and Marxstadt revealed healthy, red-cheeked men, women, and children and ample
                    supplies of food (with the exception of bread) offered at prices far below those prevailing in the <placeName>

                    preliminary report to Hoover, Goodrich told of seeing peasants methodically gathering
                    "famine weeds" (cockle burrs, wild rose pods, and miscellaneous seeds) to be
                    ground and combined with rye and millet and made into bread. The leftover straw was stacked for use
                    as cattle feed, and Goodrich was told that the livestock would eat it only when everything else was
                    exhausted. In the countryside he observed that anything having food value, even cabbage leaves and
                    melon rinds, was carefully saved. In one commune near Saratov he saw not a single dog and was
                    informed that they had all been butchered for sausage. Typhus, spread by lice, added to the
                    distress. After visiting a young Quaker who was hospitalized with typhus at Samara, Goodrich found
                    it difficult to sleep as he imagined typhus-infected lice were crawling over him.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Instead of continuing down the Volga by boat to Saratov and the German colonies, Goodrich, on the
                    advice of government authorities, proceeded by train on the grounds that it would be
                    faster—a prediction that proved highly optimistic. Once again he was accompanied by
                    Golder, who was now joined by Professor Lincoln Hutchinson of the University of California at
                    Berkeley. True to form the interpreter missed the train, and the three Americans were left with a
                    first class compartment in which to pursue their poker game. Saratov, the first stop, impressed
                    Goodrich as clean and prosperous. For only 191/2 cents he was able to purchase "an exellent
                    meal" of soup, bread and butter, lamb chops, tea, and pastry. Joined by Repp, Goodrich then
                    proceeded by boat to his final inspection site, the communes of the Volga Germans near Marxstadt. He
                    and Repp were assigned a "very comfortable room" in the bow portion of the vessel.
                    From the deck they watched as an enormous crowd sought to board the ship. "I helped
                    ‘hook’ two ladies on with my cane and brought down the guard on me,"
                    Goodrich recorded, "but at least had the goodwill of the women."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The further south he traveled the more "appalling" was the evidence of famine:
                    parched fields, empty grain warehouses, and emaciated, discouraged peasants. In one communal
                    graveyard he counted "198 new made graves over which the grass had not started to
                    grow." Nearby he saw a small boy wearing a skeepskin coat. "He seemed so
                    sturdy," Goodrich noted in his diary. "I slapped him on the shoulder and was
                    shocked to find him nothing but skin and bones. I learned on inquiry both his parents had died a few
                    weeks ago and they were going to send him out to Marxstadt to the <list type="footnotes">

                    girls, ten and twelve years old, shivering and crying in a small shed. Since the death of their
                    parents and two brothers the week before, they said, they had had nothing to eat except for a few
                    cabbage leaves and carrots. "They were barefooted and had on no clothing except their
                    cotton dresses extending to their knees," Goodrich recorded. "They said that they
                    were very hungry. They looked as if they were in great distress, were exceedingly thin and
                    emaciated." When Goodrich asked the communal authorities why they did not energetically
                    seek to discover such cases, "they did not give a very good excuse." The governor
                    also had difficulty understanding the answer to a question that he put to a group of peasants in the
                    same commune, "Why is it when many of you have bread to eat so many others die of
                    hunger?" After a long silence one man replied, "It cannot be helped, some must die
                    for if help does not come we all must die."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At Marxstadt, Goodrich and Repp were met by Golder and Hutchinson. Jointly they returned to Saratov
                    by boat. Delayed by a fog, Goodrich, Golder, and Hutchinson again played poker, in part to pass the
                    time but also to determine who would get the best place to sleep. On this occasion the
                    governor's luck deserted him, and he had to settle for an empty corner; Hutchinson won the
                    top of the table, and Golder that part of a sofa not occupied by a sleeping Russian. By November 1
                    Goodrich was finally back in Moscow and able to recommend to Hoover that the ARA expand its child
                    and adult feeding operations in the Volga region. He further suggested that stocks of seed grain
                    should be loaned in preparation for spring planting. "It is a condition that requires
                    continued and effective action if the saving of human life is worthwhile," he concluded.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Following short trips to Kazan and Petrograd, Goodrich returned to Washington to report to Hoover in
                    person. When he left Moscow on November 14, Goodrich took with him a comprehensive memorandum from
                    Haskell outlining for the benefit of Hoover the major problems faced by the ARA. Haskell stressed
                    that he wished to avoid the sudden arrival of large quantities of food and seed grain because of the
                    inability of the Russian railroads and government departments to handle it. "Governor

                    number of American personnel would be required to supervise the relief to prevent pilfering and
                    avoid "the curse" of the inefficient and suspicious Russian bureaucracy. The ARA,
                    Goodrich was asked to tell Hoover, "was really up against it at the present moment for the

            <p>Armed with the reports of Haskell and Goodrich, Hoover adopted the realistic strategy of appealing
                    directly to Congress as the fastest method for raising sufficient relief funds. With the support of
                    President Harding, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives to appropriate ten million
                    dollars to purchase corn and seed grain "for the relief of the suffering people of Russia
                    through the American Relief Administration." On December 13, 1921, Goodrich was invited to
                    testify on the bill before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. His candid description of what he
                    had seen brought home clearly and poignantly to his listeners the extent of the calamity. Before he
                    was through, Goodrich had practically single-handedly persuaded the committee to double the amount
                    of assistance proposed in the bill.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his presentation Goodrich carefully traced the devastating effects of civil war and drought upon
                    the Volga region. Using statistics that he had painstakingly collected from communal leaders,
                    Goodrich demonstrated that "the brass-tack facts" proved the region faced mass
                    starvation unless humanitarian help was provided. He effectively illustrated his figures with
                    personal vignettes of peasants collecting famine weeds and of the two girls who "probably
                    would have starved to death if we had not found them." He told also of seeing at Saratov a
                    man and his wife who had not eaten for a week and who were "lying at the point of
                    death." Was the proposed ten-million-dollar appropriation sufficient to save the starving
                    of Russia, he was asked? "No sir," he replied, "I do not think it is
                    enough, gentlemen. It ought to be doubled. It ought to be 20,000,000 bushels of corn and 5,000,000
                    bushels of wheat sent over from this country to save that situation." By December 22 both
                    houses of Congress had approved twenty million dollars for Russian relief. President Harding
                    promptly signed the measure into law and appointed a five-member Purchasing Commission, which
                    included Goodrich as one of its members, to acquire the needed supplies and distribute them through
                    the ARA.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    strange had Goodrich, a lifelong politician, failed to take into account the political implications
                    of furnishing aid to Soviet Russia. As he considered the famine situation, Goodrich found that many
                    humanitarian and political questions were intricately intertwined. Would famine relief to the
                    starving people of Russia bolster an ideologically repugnant government? Was Communist Russia the
                    final product of the Russian revolution? And, if it appeared that the Soviets were solidly
                    entrenched, should America abandon nonrecognition and restore <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>-Russian trade?</p>
            <p>At first Goodrich had his hands full just coping with the travel and information-gathering aspects of
                    his mission. As time went on, he was more and more intrigued by political considerations. In
                    particular he came to feel, as he implied in letters to Hoover and Secretary of State Charles Evans
                    Hughes, that famine relief might accelerate the return of capitalism to Russia. "On every
                    hand," Goodrich wrote Hughes, "I see the most conclusive evidence of the return of
                    the Government to a capitalistic basis." Goodrich told Hoover that he had observed
                    "such a complete abandonment of the underlying principles of communism that I care not by
                    what name they call it, tactics or what not, it marks the complete failure of communism and out of
                    this will grow not by revolution, but by evolution, a state wherein the right of property and of the
                    individual to the fruits of his toil will sooner or later be respected and protected."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> The governor's almost utopian vision of the future was shaped by his
                    basic misreading of Lenin's New Economic Policy, which had been introduced six months prior
                    to Goodrich's first Russian trip. Under the NEP the peasants were permitted to retain a
                    portion of their grain, small-scale private manufacturing was permitted, and a system of state banks
                    was established to finance new ventures and attract foreign accounts. Neither Goodrich nor many
                    members of the Communist party appreciated that the NEP was meant to be only a temporary retreat
                    from communism.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On his return from Russia Goodrich brought with him opinions on several other political questions.
                    Basing his conclusions on numerous conversations with Russians and his ARA colleagues, Goodrich
                    found no evidence of any organized opposition to the government or of any desire to return to
                    tsarism. He found that he received the same answer regardless of whether a Russian translator was
                    present or not. "I do not find anyone who even has the <list type="footnotes">

                    found not one particle of sentiment for the old order and the Russian people will have none of
                    it." Since the new government was in control and showing capitalistic tendencies, Goodrich
                    felt it was shortsighted not to encourage trade. Learning that the Russians were interested in
                    purchasing a large number of English tractors, Goodrich alertly wrote Hoover, "It seems to
                    me that there should be a chance for America here for we make the best tractors in the
                        world."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the all-important question of recognition, it is likely that Goodrich had already made up his
                    mind. There is every reason to believe that he was in agreement with Hutchinson, who advised Hoover
                    as early as November 9, 1921, that the Soviets were "firmly in the saddle" and
                    that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> should abandon its "holier than thou" policy of moral condemnation
                    and extend recognition. For the time being Goodrich kept his opinions on recognition and trade to
                    himself. When asked point-blank by Representative Tom Connally of Texas whether he favored the
                    diplomatic recognition of Russia and the resumption of trade, Goodrich tactfully replied,
                    "That, again, is a question I would rather not discuss except in executive
                    session." His discreet public silence was a demonstration that he appreciated the hazards
                    of saying anything favorable about the government of Lenin. Soon he received a reminder of the
                    controversial nature of his new subject. For telling the Foreign Policy Association of New York that
                    the Soviet leaders were "honest, sincere, misguided enthusiasts," Goodrich found
                    himself assailed as a "Red" by Ralph Easly, the secretary of the American Defense
                        Society.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By mid-February, 1922, Goodrich was once again on his way to Russia to survey the food situation. On
                    the day of his departure he ended his silence on the question of recognition and began a quiet
                    personal campaign to convince the Harding administration that the recognition of Russia was
                    inevitable and justified. Writing to Hoover, he described attending a business luncheon with the
                    president of the Westinghouse Company and representatives of oil, railroad, and agricultural
                    equipment companies. All the executives, he found, were anxious to restore trade with Russia and
                    were concerned that the Germans and British would monopolize Russia's foreign trade. The
                    meeting confirmed Goodrich's view that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> should seize the initiative and "take positive action with reference to
                    Russia." Echoing an argument previously advanced by Hutchinson, Goodrich contended,

                    proper assurances, cooperate in a friendly way in the rebuilding of Russia." Finally,
                    Goodrich urged that Hoover, Hughes, and Harding meet "and determine the position of our
                        country."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> As a practical man, Goodrich could not have been too
                    surprised that his letter failed to produce a top level meeting and a diplomatic revolution. He
                    understood that presenting the "facts" about Russia as he saw them was going to
                    require great persistence, but he could not have guessed that the debate over recognition would last
                    until 1933.</p>
            <p>Soon after Goodrich reached Moscow on March 9, he took up with Haskell the most unpleasant aspect of
                    his trip. As a humanitarian organization dedicated to feeding the starving, the ARA might have been
                    expected to be immune to misconduct on the part of its personnel. On the contrary, Hoover had been
                    shocked to receive reports of heavy drinking on the part of the Moscow staff. Goodrich was told to
                    get to the bottom of the problem. In the resulting investigation Goodrich learned that the drinking
                    bouts had occurred during Haskell's absence in London; moreover, he found that one of the
                    offenders in Moscow had also carried on an illicit relationship with a Russian woman. Demonstrating
                    a hard-boiled side to his personality, Goodrich concluded that heads had to roll. On his
                    recommendation two supervisors at Moscow were dismissed, and the ARA supervisor at Riga was
                    disciplined for "philandering with the wives of some of the American personnel."
                    In addition, based on information verified by Golder, Goodrich purged the ARA supervisor at
                    Petrograd for intoxication and for repeatedly having prostitutes transported to ARA headquarters in
                    an official automobile. On Hoover's recommendation Cyril J. C. Quinn was named as
                    Haskell's chief assistant; as a result Goodrich found that the general atmosphere was
                    greatly improved, enabling him to concentrate once again upon the famine.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Goodrich's intent was to retrace his route of the fall, going by rail to Samara and then
                    continuing to Orenburg two hundred miles further to the east. The entire trip was to take no more
                    than a week. Once again Goodrich found that the schedules of Russian railroads could not be relied
                    upon and that the plans of the traveler to Russia were often made to be broken. All went well on the
                    trip to Samara where he found that conditions were steadily improving due to the arrival of several
                    trainloads of American corn. A program devoted especially to feeding starving children was serving

                    rapidly via the primitive roads of the countryside. Sixty miles from Orenburg Goodrich's
                    train was delayed by reports that a gang of bandits was blocking the track. Then overnight
                    "a terrific snow storm" developed. Ascertaining that he would be unable to reach
                    Orenburg, Goodrich asked to have his car coupled to a freight train en route to Samara. At the town
                    of Bogotai, however, the train became stuck in "an insurmountable drift."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> For five days the line was closed by conditions which, in Goodrich's

                    </placeName> for more than twenty-four hours. "The delay here," he concluded,
                    "is due to lack of equipment, absence of executive ability, and utter inefficiency in
                    dealing with a situation of this kind." At least the experience gave him an opportunity to
                    interview at length the peasants who had come in sledges drawn by horses and camels to transport
                    American corn back to their villages. He found them to be "in general, a pretty happy,
                    good-natured lot of folks." Their happy dispositions were possibly due to the fact that
                    they were about to receive their first real food in many months. At the same time that Goodrich
                    observed the peasants to be strong and ruddy, he was told by English Quaker relief workers that ten
                    to fifteen persons a day were dying in the vicinity from hunger and typhus; and he noticed one man

            <p>On his return to Moscow, seeing that the famine situation in the Volga region was coming under
                    control, Goodrich spent a final three days gathering political and economic information. First, with
                    some trepidation, he and Golder interviewed Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the commissar of railroads. Formerly
                    Dzerzhinsky had headed the Cheka, the dreaded secret police who had displayed great vigor in
                    crushing opponents of the regime. Instead of a bluebeard Goodrich was pleasantly surprised to meet
                    "as kindly mannered a man as ever scuttled a ship." Goodrich, who had once run a
                    railroad and who had had dismal experiences with the Russian rail system, was fascinated by the
                    subject. He was assured that the seed sent from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would be distributed in time for spring planting and that service would be
                    substantially improved by the purchase of 187 steam locomotives from Germany and Sweden. In answer
                    to a direct question from Goodrich, Dzerzhinsky said that the Transport Department preferred
                    American steam engines produced by the Baldwin Company and had only purchased the German and Swedish
                    models out of necessity. Goodrich came away with the impression that diplomatic recognition of
                    Russia by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would be followed by the flowering of Soviet-American trade.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The question of Russian-American trade relations arose again the next evening following a dinner
                    given for A. Scheinmann, the director of the Russian State Bank. The Americans in attendance were
                    Goodrich, Golder, Hutchinson, and Quinn. According to Golder's notes Goodrich expressed a
                    desire to have business relations opened but said the American people were not yet ready to support
                    diplomatic recognition. "Why talk about the people," Scheinmann cynically
                    retorted. "They have nothing to do with the matter, it is the government that is against us
                    and not the people." When Goodrich remarked that the ARA was in Russia merely to feed the
                    hungry with no ulterior motive whatsoever, "the expression on Scheinmann's face
                    indicated that he wondered if I thought he was foolish enough to believe that sort of
                        thing."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Finally Goodrich lost his temper and stated that if the
                    Soviet government "enjoyed playing such petty politics and such childish games, he was
                    through with them." Golder was especially outraged by such high-handed conduct.
                    "Three months ago Governor Goodrich was in favor of recognition," he recorded,
                    "but he has now lost much of his enthusi- <list type="footnotes">

                    real statesmen, but today I see in them cheap east side politicians and shopkeepers."
                    Perhaps his pique was accentuated by the adverse results of the poker game played after
                    Scheinmann's departure in which Golder lost 300,000 rubles to Goodrich and Quinn.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a good night's sleep Goodrich's resentment had subsided. As he prepared for
                    his long trip home, he drafted lengthy reports for Hoover and President Harding. Going beyond the
                    mere presentation of information, he offered unambiguous advice about the direction American policy
                    should take. In general he felt encouraged by the course of the ARA work despite some obstruction on
                    the part of the inefficient Soviet bureaucracy and the delays caused by the decrepit railroad
                    system. Turning to political matters, Goodrich admitted having had some misconceptions. Perhaps as a
                    result of his encounter with Scheinmann, he would concede some doubts about his earlier idea that
                    the Soviet leaders were merely honest idealists who were ignorant of economic principles. Still he
                    could see no chance at all of any challenge to the government, which led him back to his original
                    conclusion. As he wrote Hoover, "I am still of the opinion that the situation will be
                    solved sooner, and the Russian people be more quickly relieved from this intolerable burden by the
                    recognition of its Government, by the setting up of diplomatic and consular corps, with commercial
                    agents throughout Russia, and the opening up of Russia to the outside world." He remained
                    convinced, he advised Hoover and Harding, that America's policy of nonrecognition had
                    failed, that the revolution was an accomplished fact, and that America ought to extend recognition
                    and permit American capital to participate in Russia's economic development.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In deference to Hoover's request that he be "guarded upon questions of political
                    recognition of Russia until conferences here," Goodrich confined his views to official
                    channels. Nevertheless, Hoover was open minded enough that he made no attempt to silence Goodrich. A
                    few weeks before, Hoover had been asked by the editor of the Philadelphia <hi rend="i">Public
                    Ledger</hi> whether, in his opinion, the newspaper should print several articles on Russia that
                    Goodrich had agreed to write. Specifically Hoover was asked "just what kind of angled
                    stuff" the governor was likely to submit. The editor added, "We've had
                    glimmers that he comes out of Lenine-land pretty well saturated with Soviet ideas and with the
                    notion that all is lovely there." Through his assistant, Christian A. Herter, Hoover
                    defended Goodrich, saying he felt anything the governor wrote <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>On April 20, after a journey of sixteen days, Goodrich was back in Washington having breakfast with
                    "the Chief." During an "extended conference" Hoover and Goodrich
                    discussed the progress of ARA operations, and Hoover said he was especially pleased that Haskell and
                    Goodrich had enforced discipline by "getting rid" of the "bad
                    actors." Hoover than asked Goodrich to make a final Russian inspection trip with his
                    departure scheduled for May 17. Afterward a glowing statement was given out to the press under
                    Goodrich's name extolling the ARA (and indirectly Hoover) for having broken the back of the
                    famine. Actually the press release was drafted by Hoover and George Barr Baker, the public relations
                    officer of the ARA, and it was decidedly premature in its claim that the famine was "under
                        control."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> In late April many areas of the Volga were just
                    receiving their first American aid, and ARA operations in the Ukrainian famine districts bordering
                    the Black Sea had not yet gotten under way.</p>
            <p>By the end of May Goodrich reached England after "a very tedious voyage." Waiting
                    for him was a wire from Haskell stating that encouraging reports were coming in from the famine
                    areas concerning their food prospects. Goodrich was especially pleased by the good news from Samara.
                    If the state of Samara could take care of itself, he reasoned, then it was likely that the rest of
                    the famine areas were well on the way to recovery also. Goodrich was especially pleased to learn
                    that the famine was ebbing because it would leave him more time for politics. As he wrote Hoover,
                    "This [the optimistic crop estimates] will leave me time enough to go into the political
                    situation and ascertain what, if anything, can be done with the outfit at the head of the Russian
                    government." In London the governor's spirits were further buoyed when Walter
                    Lyman Brown, the ARA director from Europe, agreed to permit Golder, the poker playing history
                    professor, to accompany him to Moscow as his translator.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On his previous visits to Moscow, Goodrich had confined himself to conducting official ARA business.
                    On his third visit to the Russian capital (June 7-21, 1922) Goodrich seized the opportunity to
                    conduct with high Soviet officials wide-ranging political discussions that went far beyond issues of
                    humanitarian relief. Although the talks did not alter the status quo, they did produce the fullest

                    in November, 1933. At first, however, Goodrich was stymied by the problem of how to initiate
                    political talks with the "higher-ups." After all, the purpose of the ARA was to
                    feed the hungry, and the organization had specifically promised to refrain from political activity.
                    According to Golder's notes, while he and Goodrich "were scheming how to bring
                    about a meeting with [Karl] Radek [chief of the Propaganda Bureau] and [Lev B.] Kamenev [chairman of
                    the Soviet Relief Commission] without taking the first steps," an invitation luckily
                    arrived from Radek asking the two Americans to have tea with him at the Kremlin. The discussion
                    began on a sour note as Radek launched a bitter attack on America, contending that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was the greatest enemy of the Russian nation. Goodrich was able to break into the
                    speech several times to say that America sought an understanding with the Soviets, and he made Radek
                    smile when he remarked that the bankers of America and not the Communists of Russia were the true
                    internationalists of the day. Finally Radek said that the Russian government would consent to a
                    declaration of its willingness to pay its debts and suggested that Goodrich should meet with Kamenev
                    and "other important Communists." Alexander Eyduck, the Soviet liaison with the
                    ARA, agreed to make the arrangement.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Almost two weeks were required to get all the parties together. In the meantime Goodrich had a unique
                    experience when Eyduck asked if he would like to visit a warehouse to examine some property
                    belonging to the government. Under the impression he was going to be shown some furs, Goodrich
                    agreed. Instead of seeing furs the governor was introduced to a jeweler from Moscow who brought
                    forth three sealed iron chests. In Goodrich's presence the seals were broken and the chests
                    opened revealing the crown jewels of the Romanov monarchy. "It was a perfectly marvelous
                    collection," Goodrich noted. "The old Czar's crown, the crowns of the
                    Czarina and the various members of the royal family, with diamonds varying from one to 200 carats,
                    all of the purest water, and wonderful color. Crowns of diamonds, of diamonds and pearls, emeralds,
                    rubies and amethysts; collars, bracelets, necklaces. The scene beggared description. I never saw
                    anything like it; it did not seem possible there could be so many jewels in the world."
                    After Goodrich had viewed the scene "until my eyes were weary with the blaze of
                    light," the tour came to an end. The apparent purpose of the demonstration was to show the
                    world through Goodrich that the Soviets had not broken up the collection, as had been widely
                        rumored.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>Over the next week Golder was able to secure separate invitations for Goodrich to meet with such
                    "higher-ups" as Kamenev, Leon Trotsky (commissar for war), Maxim Litvinov
                    (assistant commissar for foreign affairs), Aleksei Rykov (assistant to Lenin), Leonid Krassin
                    (commissar of foreign trade), and Grigori Sokolnikov (commissar of finance). Recalling his less than
                    satisfactory interviews with Scheinmann and Radek, Goodrich resolved to avoid separate discussions
                    and insisted that only a joint meeting was acceptable to him. Such a forum, he concluded, would be
                    the most efficient way to discover the real prospects for establishing normal relations. At last
                    Kamenev arranged for a meeting of all those officials with whom Goodrich wished to speak to be held
                    at his Kremlin office the afternoon of June 19; only Trotsky was unable to attend. Accompanied by
                    Golder, Goodrich opened the talks by stating that the Harding administration had asked him to
                    explain informally the American attitude toward Russia. Without revealing that he disagreed with
                    America's nonrecognition policy, Goodrich cited a statement issued by Secretary of State
                    Hughes on March 25 listing certain conditions that must be met prior to recognition. In order,
                    Goodrich took up the points listed by Hughes and was told it was Soviet policy to respect the safety
                    of human life and the sanctity of property and contracts, as well as the free status of labor.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With only a few exceptions the general tone of the meeting was conciliatory and businesslike. One
                    point of dispute arose when Goodrich questioned whether the government was orchestrating a public
                    demonstration the next day to demand the death penalty for thirty-four Socialist Revolutionaries who
                    were on trial for sedition. Goodrich was not at all satisfied by Kamenev's assurance that
                    the demonstration was a spontaneous manifestation of public opinion. (When Golder and Goodrich
                    attended the parade the next day in Red Square, Golder found out from the marchers that they had
                    been paid their wages for the day in return for participating; Golder also heard the presiding judge
                    promise the crowd that the prisoners "would receive all that was coming to them";
                    and he observed that when the prosecutor asked the crowd, " 'Shall we inflict the
                    death penalty on the prisoners? the reply translated into good old American meant ‘Give
                    them hell. Shoot them!’") The other major topic of dispute involved the
                    repudiation by the Soviets of all debts owed by previous governments. Goodrich flatly stated,
                    "You are wasting your time with America unless you are ready to recognize the debt and
                    issue obligations promising to pay in the future." Kamenev and Krassin replied that all
                    revolutionary parties since the Revolution of 1905 had agreed that the tsar's debts must
                    never be <list type="footnotes">

                    some expedient could easily be devised to settle what was actually a small sum. After two hours
                    Kamenev concluded the discussion by observing that the Soviets had "a real desire"
                    to improve relations with America, that there was no major obstacle to a settlement of the debt
                    question, and that the next step would be to submit the issues under dispute to persons who were
                    officially empowered to act.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From Goodrich's perspective the meeting had provided a useful exchange of views, but the
                    governor did not deceive himself into thinking that significant new ground had been broken. After
                    his return to the Pink House he decided that his report of the meeting was not important enough to
                    justify the expense of transmitting it to Washington by telegraph instead of by regularly scheduled
                    courier. On the positive side Goodrich was mildly encouraged by the civility of the Soviet officials
                    and by the discovery that the positions of the two powers were not too far apart. Nothing occurred
                    at the meeting to alter Goodrich's view that the Soviets were deserving of diplomatic
                        recognition.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Goodrich's final week in Russia was spent in a whirlwind tour of Nizhnii Novgorod, Kazan,
                    and Samara. With few exceptions he found the food situation to be much improved, thanks to the
                    American corn and the prospects of a good harvest. Where the crops were not so good, Goodrich blamed
                    inefficient management rather than the weather. At one commune where a manager directed 105 men with
                    indifferent results, Goodrich observed, "I can take a dozen Americans and with proper
                    equipment secure better results than he is getting with his hundred." At another commune
                    Goodrich was told by the inhabitants that they needed additional American aid to survive and that
                    they had only 18 sheep left as opposed to 200 the previous year, only 38 cows left of 180, and no
                    hogs at all. Yet in his tour of the commune Goodrich observed several hogs roaming about, and in the
                    distance he saw a herd of cows that appeared to consist of more than 38 animals. Then as he left, a
                    herd of sheep came in from the pasture, and Goodrich, as inconspicuously as possible, counted 52
                    sheep and 47 lambs. "I do not believe they made a single truthful statement about their
                    livestock and crops," he concluded. In his judgment the Volga region, even though it was
                    not fully recovered, would be able to get along without large scale American aid during the winter
                    of 1922-1923.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    London. "I am not unmindful of the responsibility we take in advising the course outlined
                    in our wire, yet after our trip through the <geogName>Volga valley</geogName> I would make the
                    statement stronger rather than weaker!" Two weeks after his return to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Goodrich attended a meeting of the ARA directors in New York. The directors concluded
                    that adult feeding should be ended with the new harvest on September 1 and that child feeding should
                    be continued on a reduced scale through existing institutions such as schools and orphanages. The
                    phasing out of the famine relief operation meant that many fewer employees were required. Now the
                    Moscow staff of the ARA would be able to handle the work of inspecting a smaller operation.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Thus after three exhausting trips to Russia, Goodrich, with the assistance of
                    the ARA, had worked himself out of a job.</p>
            <p>Over the next year Goodrich was able to concentrate upon his neglected business affairs while he
                    continued to work quietly to modify the official nonrecognition policy that bore little relation to
                    the Russia he had seen with his own eyes. By 1923 Goodrich had adopted a new strategy to normalize <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>-Soviet relations. Previously he had advocated diplomatic recognition and trade. Now he
                    emphasized establishing business relations as a first step without making any mention of diplomatic
                    recognition. Ordinarily Goodrich would have addressed his arguments to the State Department of
                    Charles Evans Hughes. In Goodrich's opinion, however, the secretary of state's
                    mind was completely closed upon the subject of recognition. "I can't talk to
                    Hughes about it," Goodrich complained to Hoover. "He takes the view of a technical
                    lawyer …." Considering Hughes a lost cause, Goodrich used Hoover as a sounding
                    board for his ideas. He pointed out to Hoover that without exception the ARA men with experience in
                    Russia, men such as Haskell, Golder, Hutchinson, and Quinn, all favored the opening of trade
                    relations with the Soviets. Seeking to convert Hoover, Goodrich cleverly quoted a letter he had
                    received from Haskell: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I think a great mistake is being made in not negotiating with the Soviet towards a trade
                            agreement at least. In my mind it is foolish to pay any attention to what is published in
                            their newspapers as what they do at some frontier etc. etc. … All those things
                            are so insignificant compared to the big show. Furthermore, they would all disappear if
                            friendly relations, i.e. business relations, were inaugurated. Of course, they are bad in
                            one sense and silly in another but when understood one can get on with them. We are doing
                            business today with worse people.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

                    </quote> Using an argument later advanced by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Goodrich maintained that it was

                    rather have them in the family circle where we can talk things over with them," Goodrich
                    concluded. "With the departure of the A.R.A. the last point of contact with Russia will be
                        severed."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In principle, Hoover agreed with much of what Goodrich had to say. "On the general question
                    of some sort of trade relationship I am, of course, in agreement with You," Hoover replied.
                    As a potential successor to Harding, Hoover apparently felt, however, that any public endorsement of
                    the controversial views of his ARA colleagues would be too risky politically. Goodrich then turned
                    to Harding and urged the sending of a commission to explore a trade agreement. "The sooner
                    we have the courage to recognize the solution the sooner will real peace be established and the
                    return of the world to normalcy be accelerated," he wrote. Finally, he expressed the wish
                    to see Harding before the president left on his summer vacation trip to Alaaka.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> The meeting with Harding was never held because, on his return from Alaska, the president
                    became ill at San Francisco and died there on August 2. His successor, Calvin Coolidge of Vermont,
                    was even less informed and less interested in foreign policy than his predecessor. In effect the
                    change in presidential leadership meant that Goodrich had to start all over in seeking to promote a
                    more moderate American policy toward Russia.</p>
            <p>Recognizing that in politics timing is all important, Goodrich resisted making overtures about Russia
                    to Coolidge until the right psychological moment. On his return to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from his fourth and final trip to the Soviet Union in December, 1925, Goodrich decided
                    the time had arrived for broaching the controversial subject. Goodrich, his wife, Haskell, and
                    Golder had just completed an intensive five-week Russian tour. Starting at Leningrad, they had
                    traveled to Moscow and from there proceeded to the Volga to observe the extent of that
                    region's recovery from the famine. Goodrich's general impression was that
                    "remarkable progress" had been made in restoring the railroads, manufacturing,
                    finance, and agriculture.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> The contrast between 1921 and 1925 was particularly
                    great in the German communes of the Volga. Once the scene of death and desolation, the region was
                    now producing plentiful supplies of grain, meat, and the best melons Goodrich had ever eaten. At one
                    stop Goodrich was recognized by a peasant woman who, in tears, threw her arms about his neck and
                    said that the ARA had saved her children from starvation. "Soon a crowd of people were
                    gathered around me," he recorded, "and I saw several faces whom <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Back in Moscow Goodrich found industry and transport humming. The train station was distinguished by
                    its "unbelievable cleanliness," although a thief stole his briefcase when he set
                    it down while haggling with the driver of a droshky. A young army officer found out from bystanders
                    who had taken it, and in a few minutes the thief was under arrest. Goodrich's property was
                    returned minus only a fountain pen and a pencil. In the Russian capital he found it no more
                    difficult to transact banking business than in the West. Golder found some rare books that he wished
                    to purchase for the Hoover War Library at Stanford University. Goodrich, therefore, cabled New York
                    in the afternoon for one thousand dollars and by 9:00 a.m. the next day the funds were credited to
                    his account. Everywhere he found great curiosity about the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and he was repeatedly asked about Henry Ford and the "Dayton Monkey
                        Trial."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before leaving Goodrich interviewed several high Soviet leaders including Litvinov, Radek, Trotsky,
                    and Joseph Stalin. All denied any connection between the Soviet government and the inflammatory
                    propaganda of the Third International, and all claimed that they favored a prompt solution to all <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>-Soviet disputes so as to make possible full diplomatic recognition. Stalin especially
                    impressed Goodrich as "a man of rare good common sense, sound judgment, and in my opinion
                    [he] is easily the most powerful factor in Russia." Stalin stressed that Russia could not,
                    for political reasons, repeal its repudiation of foreign debts, but he assured Goodrich that a
                    settlement could be easily achieved on a mutually satisfactory basis. In conclusion, Stalin told
                    Goodrich "that the Russian people liked the Americans and preferred closer cooperation with
                    them to any country on earth."<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>On his return to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Goodrich was in a quandary. More than ever he was convinced that the Soviet Union was a
                    permanent fixture in world politics. But convincing President Coolidge that America should abandon
                    its nonrecognition policy seemed hopeless, as the new president's mind was definitely
                    closed on the subject. Knowing that the odds were overwhelmingly against him, Goodrich decided
                    nonetheless to write the president urging him to modify his views. Under Stalin, Goodrich told the
                    president, <list type="footnotes">

                    western-style industrial society. "It is safe to say today," he wrote in November,
                    1925, "that the working classes of Russia are in better condition and better satisfied than
                    they were under the Tsar." Recognition, Goodrich advised Coolidge, would advance world
                    stability, strengthen American business ties with Russia, and "accelerate rather than
                    retard the march now going on from communism to capitalism." Even Goodrich must have been
                    discouraged when the only response from the White House was a bland two-sentence note from Coolidge
                    thanking him for his "interesting letter."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the remaining fifteen years of his life Goodrich was active as a banker and as a member of several
                    governmental commissions, including the International St. Lawrence Waterways Commission. He
                    continued to play a prominent role in Indiana politics and was a delegate to every Republican
                    convention through 1940. In domestic politics his views were consistently conservative. In 1928 he
                    was an enthusiastic supporter of Hoover and was subsequently appointed by Hoover to a commission to
                    study conservation. His main disagreement with Hoover was that the president failed to slash
                    government spending sufficiently to balance the federal budget. On the subject of Russia, however,
                    Goodrich remained an advocate of recognition and trade. President Roosevelt's decision to
                    recognize the Soviet Union in November, 1933, met with Goodrich's hearty approval, and
                    Goodrich received a note from Roosevelt thanking him for his support. With this exception, however,
                    Goodrich was shocked by the New Deal's "crazy" expenditures on public
                    works, agricultural price supports, and relief and by its experiments in public power and social
                        security.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1937 Goodrich planned an extensive tour of the Soviet Union, hoping to study its industrial
                    progress under Stalin's Five-Year Plans. Whether such a trip (which coincided with the
                    brutal purging of Kamenev, Radek, Rykov, and others) would have caused him to reappraise his opinion
                    of Stalin is unknown because Goodrich was forced to cancel the visit as the result of a serious
                    heart condition. He died of heart failure on August 16, 1940, shortly after attending the Republican
                    convention at Philadelphia which nominated Wendell Willkie of Indiana for president. In the entire
                    life of this Indiana Republican there was only one unconventional aspect: his love affair with the
                    Russian people who reminded him of "the folks at home."</p>

            <p>During his lifetime James P. Goodrich, despite his four trips to Russia and his contacts in both the
                    Republican party and the Communist party, had little visible success in moderating American policy
                    toward Soviet Russia. Since hardly anyone took him or his recommendations seriously, he can, in this
                    respect, be viewed as a failure; the prevalent view was that he was a babe in the Russian woods
                    whose views were unworthy of serious consideration. At the beginning of his ARA mission in 1921 it
                    was true that Goodrich was a dilettante about all things Russian. Over the next four years, however,
                    he became much better informed about Russia as a result of his travels, his conversations with
                    Soviet leaders, and his association with historian Frank A. Golder. Still his lack of information
                    about the revolution and its background contributed to his failure to see that Lenin's New
                    Economic Policy was only a temporary retreat. Simplistically viewing the Bolsheviks as honest but
                    ignorant idealists, he failed to appreciate the deep ideological commitment of the Soviet leaders to
                    establishing socialism.</p>
            <p>If he was not always right on the details, Goodrich frequently saw the overall picture more clearly
                    than the so-called "experts" who confidently expected the Soviets to collapse. His
                    assessment of the "plain facts" about Russia led him to conclude that the
                    revolution was an accomplished fact, that the Soviets had the support of the vast majority of the
                    Russian people, that they were capable of maintaining law and order, and that they faced no visible
                    opposition whatsoever. The "brass-tack facts" led him to the conclusion that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> should extend diplomatic recognition, restore trade, and accept Russia as a legitimate
                    factor in world politics. Demonstrating a remarkable degree of intellectual independence, Goodrich
                    refused to be stampeded by the conventional wisdom of the day and made up his mind on the basis of
                    the evidence before him. His pragmatic approach to Soviet-American relations never wavered from the
                    morning on the Volga when he recorded: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>October 19 [1921]. My cup of bitterness and dissatisfaction is now full and running over. At
                            exactly 4:00 a.m. the secretary to the governor came thundering at our door telling us to
                            hurry to make the boat as it would soon sail. In fifteen minutes we were ready and after
                            much trouble a Cadillac car turned over to Denikin and captured by the Soviets conveyed us
                            to the dock. No boat in sight and finally we were told it would not sail until the next day.
                            I was mad enough to swear, but what was the use; they wouldn't understand English
                            so I laughed instead and made up my mind not to hem and haw, but to take Russia as it is and

            <p>Luke Decker, farmer, judge, and militia officer, owned and traded slaves in the Northwest Territory,
                    Indiana Territory, and the state of Indiana despite laws prohibiting such practices. As a member of
                    the proslavery element in the Old Northwest, Decker encouraged the establishment of slavery in the
                    territory, a plan that nearly succeeded under Indiana Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison.
                    By the time Indiana Territory was ready for statehood in 1816, however, settlers against slavery
                    outnumbered those, like Decker, who supported it. The institution was outlawed by the 1816 state
                    Constitution, but slavery did not die out. In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName>, where Decker resided and slavery was concentrated, some slave owners continued to hold
                    slaves, believing that the Constitution was not retroactive.</p>
            <p>In July, 1816, barely a month after the Indiana Constitution was written, two of Decker's
                    slaves—Bob, nominally an indentured servant, and Anthony, a slave for
                    life—escaped from his possession and fled to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName>, a Quaker stronghold in the southern part of the state. Decker pursued his slaves and
                    had them captured. Confronted by the Quaker-influenced court in Paoli, he used all of his influence
                    in his determination to regain possession of the two men.</p>
            <p>Decker's cases were before the court for five years, from 1817 to 1822. Summaries of the
                    court proceedings in early county histories and in other accounts attest to their importance.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> A study of <list type="footnotes">

                    the cases demonstrates their significance with regard to the history of slavery in early Indiana and
                    corrects numerous misconceptions. Because Decker was a member of the proslavery element in the Old
                    Northwest and because many citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName> were morally opposed to slavery, the cases also exemplify the battle between the pro-
                    and antislavery forces that divided Indiana Territory politically in its early years.
                    Decker's attempts to regain possession of Bob and Anthony are among the first proceedings
                    to challenge the legality of both indentured servitude and slavery after approval of the state
                    Constitution. The lawsuits also demonstrate the legal tactics employed by pro- and antislavery
                    attorneys as they defended the interests of their clients. Further, the cases reflect the decline of
                    the once powerful proslavery element in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Slavery had existed in the area northwest of the Ohio River almost from the beginning of settlement.
                    The French had introduced slaves in their trading centers in the mid-eighteenth century. Following
                    the American Revolution migrants from the South, especially Kentucky and Virginia, brought slaves
                    and a tolerance for slavery with them to the Old Northwest. Many of the pioneers who owned slaves
                    settled in and around Vincennes, the largest French community, and in settlements in the Illinois
                        country.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To cope with the influx of pioneers Congress acted to organize a government for the burgeoning
                    territory. Virginia was pressed to cede her western lands, including present-day Indiana and
                    Illinois, to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    Ordinance of 1787. Article VI of the ordinance stated, "There shall be neither slavery nor

                    Those who owned slaves, believing their rights were protected, were angry and confused at
                    Congress's failure to address the question of existing slavery. A loosely organized
                    proslavery element emerged to eliminate Article VI and legalize slavery in the territory.</p>
            <p>The Decker family was part of this early migration from the South, and, like many other settlers from
                    the southern states, the Deckers had owned slaves before coming to what is now Indiana. John and
                    Dinah (Kuykendall) Decker, Luke Decker's parents, had migrated with other Dutch families
                    from New York in the mideighteenth century and settled in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Virginia (now West Virginia), where Luke was born about 1760. The family farmed and
                    bought land near the upper reaches of the Potomac River. They also bought slaves. One was a woman
                    named Rachel, <hi rend="i">whom the family called</hi> "Rach."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>After the Revolution the Decker clan moved west, settling first in Kentucky, then near Vincennes,
                    Indiana, about 1784. Claiming land near the Duchis River, they began farming in what is now known as
                    Decker Township.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> They brought their slaves with them and may have purchased
                    more along the way. When John Decker died in 1790, he bequeathed four female slaves to his wife and
                    children. Luke Decker inherited all of his father's lands and tenements and, after the

                    that led him to a position of influence in the effort to eliminate Article VI of the Ordinance of
                    1787 and to establish slavery in the Northwest, and later Indiana, Territory.</p>
            <p>One of the first acts of the proslavery element in the Old Northwest was to petition Congress for
                    suspension or repeal of Article VI. In 1793, as judge of the Court of Common Pleas, Decker received
                    a letter from Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, written in response to a
                    petition from mostly French settlers who had requested interpretation of the article prohibiting
                        slavery.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> St. Clair's response, that Article VI was not
                    retroactive, gave settlers who had owned slaves before 1787 permission to continue holding them and
                    gave slavery a firm hold in the territory. Even without St. Clair's encouragement slave
                    owners found effective ways to circumvent Article VI. Many entered into long-term indentures with
                    their unwitting slaves or bequeathed them as property, as John Decker had, to the next generation.</p>
            <p>Decker and the proslavery element sought William Henry Harrison as their ally when Harrison arrived

                    acting under powers that granted them the right to use laws from the original thirteen states to
                    govern the territory, adopted in 1803 a law from a Virginia code that required slaves brought into
                    the territory to fulfill their contracts.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1805, after Indiana moved to the second territorial stage of government, the first legislative
                    assembly further legalized forced servitude by passing a law that permitted any person owning or
                    purchasing a slave outside the territory to bring them into the territory and bind them into
                    service. The terms of the indenture were to be recorded with the county clerk within thirty days.
                    After sixty days any slave not agreeing to the terms could be sent out of the territory and sold.
                    Slaves, then, could either accept an indenture, usually lasting between twenty and forty years, or
                    be taken out of the territory and sold for life.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Decker must have availed
                    himself of this legislation for he had at least one indentured servant, Bob, with whom he had made a

                    1807, the legislature adopted yet another resolution to Congress reiterating that slaves had existed
                    in Indiana Territory before the Ordinance of 1787 and asking for a suspension of Article VI.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Near the close of this session the governor approved the passage of a bill
                    entitled "An Act Concerning Servants," a revision of the 1805 indenture laws
                    specifying how servants were expected to perform. Decker probably concurred with this legislation
                    also, for, during the second session of the legislature in the fall of 1808, he led a committee to
                    amend the act by further defining and restricting servants' actions.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                    been recognized for decades in the courts and the majority of citizens approved of indentures, the
                    first of seven freedom suits, in which slaves sued their owners, was begun in October, 1817.
                    Predictably, in only one case of these seven did the court rule in favor of the slave in spite of

                    </placeName> most of the residents of Indiana readily recognized the illegality of slavery. The
                    future implications of the constitutional ruling prohibiting slavery were probably clear to Decker
                    also. Perhaps it was business as usual, but there is evidence that Decker, or a member of his
                    family, embarked from Vincennes by boat in July, 1816, with a group of slaves to sell in the South.
                    The slaves escaped in Mississippi and sued for their freedom. The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled in
                    their favor in 1818, citing Article VI and the new Indiana Constitution well in advance of the
                    courts in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bob and Anthony also left Decker's possession in July of 1816. Perhaps they escaped from the
                    party of slaves being taken south, for those slaves risked being sold for life, but the
                    circumstances regarding their escape are unclear. They fled to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, sixty miles east of Vincennes, where Decker found them in Paoli the following January.
                    He had them captured by the sheriff, Zachariah Lindley.</p>
            <p>The destination turned out to be a fortunate one for two fugitives in search of shelter and
                    assistance. Half a dozen years before, Quaker Jonathan Lindley, members of his family, and another
                    small caravan of Quakers fled from the spread of slavery in North Carolina and settled in the Blue
                    River area of Indiana Territory. <list type="footnotes">

                            36 (1818). In an unpopular action a Mississippi Supreme Court judge overruled a lower court
                            decision and freed the slaves. They had claimed that one John Decker had taken them from
                            Virginia to Vincennes about 1784 and had held them in slavery in violation of Article VI and
                            the new Indiana Constitution. Unfortunately, the circuit court records that might further
                            identify "Decker" and "Hopkins" have not been found.
                            There is little doubt, however, that "Decker" is Luke Decker.</item>

                    appointed one Zachariah Lindley sheriff and ordered him to organize the new county and county seat,
                    which were named after the county and town that the Quakers had left behind in North Carolina. The
                    Lindleys and their friends and neighbors had brought with them their democratic principles and
                    strong abhorrence of slavery.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Decker had perhaps heard of the Lindleys but probably overestimated his own influence. Bob and
                    Anthony were returned to Decker but on custody of bail. David Raymond, president judge of the Second
                    Circuit, served Decker with writs of habeas corpus requesting that he appear before the court with
                    his slaves to present his reasons for detaining them.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Decker hired Charles
                    Dewey, a recent arrival in Paoli from Massachusetts, to defend him despite the fact that Dewey had
                    not yet applied to the bar. <placeName>

            <p>Decker, in his return to Bob's writ of habeas corpus, stated that he had rightly held Bob as
                    an indentured servant under the terms of a fifteen-year contract signed in 1804 for a sum of four
                    hundred dollars. He charged that Bob "did fraudently, secretly, and without

                    the 29th of January …," leaving two years of his contract unfulfilled. As proof,

                    plea Bob admitted signing the indenture agreement but stated that "far from being voluntary
                    … it was extorted from him under duress—and was the mere effect of fear,
                    force, and complusion." Stephen and Goodlet argued that Bob had been held as a slave by
                    Decker prior to 1804 in violation of Article VI and therefore had served the terms of his
                        indenture.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Decker had pursued his slaves to <placeName>

                    </placeName> with Bob's indenture agreement in hand, he was not prepared to defend his
                    ownership of Anthony. In answer to the writ of habeas corpus Decker stated that he had inherited
                    Anthony under the terms of his father's will, his father being an original inhabitant from
                    Virginia. In an amended return, presented the same day, Decker corrected himself by claiming that
                    his father had owned Anthony's mother, "Rach," and that Anthony had been
                    born in passage from Virginia prior to 1787. The following day, January 31, 1817, Dewey stated that
                    Decker was not in possession of the facts and requested permission to present an amended return at
                    the next court session in April, 1817.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Anthony, in his plea, stated that
                    neither Decker nor his father had had the right to hold him in slavery because he had been born in
                    1792, five years after the ratification of the Ordinance of 1787, and had therefore been held in
                    violation of Article VI.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> For some reason, perhaps because a legal precedent
                    had not yet been established, Stephen and Goodlet chose to rely on the antislavery provisions of
                    Article VI instead of citing the new Indiana Constitution on behalf of Bob and Anthony.</p>
            <p>Decker posted $100, and Jonathan Lindley loaned him $50 more to meet a

                    Decker turned for aid to old friends sympathetic to his proslavery position. Perhaps unsure of
                    Dewey, he hired Henry Hurst, member of the bar in both Vincennes and Pa-oli, who had witnessed

                        state. The Second Circuit, composed of those counties in the middle of the state, included

            <p>In July of the previous year, 1817, Decker had been granted permission to remove his erroneous

                    an amended one. The amended return may have been prepared at that time but was probably not
                    presented to the court before the 1818 session because of the changes in venue. Decker's
                    amended return for Anthony, as well as Dewey's letter to Raymond in March, 1818, give some

                    long before 1787, and that he had migrated with his family and slaves to St. Vincents (Vincennes),
                    also before 1787, where he died shortly thereafter. From John Decker's will he quoted,
                    "I likewise give and bequeath unto my wife Dinah a negro wench named Rach during her
                    natural life, and at her death to revert to my son Luke." Hurst then added that
                    "Rach" was the mother of Anthony and that after Dinah's death
                    "Rach" and Anthony had reverted to Luke Decker, who continued lawfully to hold
                    Anthony as his slave until Anthony's escape in July, 1816.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>It is not clear if Dewey's comments to Raymond concerning Anthony were actually used in
                    court, but they are valuable nonetheless because they reflect some of the arguments used in
                    justifying slavery. Expressing his own and the popular proslavery interpretation, Dewey stated,
                    "The act of session from Virginia to the U.S. of Northwestern Territory issues all the
                    rights of the inhabitants at the time of session—to hold slaves was one
                    right—and to hold the issue of slaves in the same bondage with their parents was another
                        right."<hi rend="sup">48</hi> With respect to the ordinance and Anthony's
                    mother, Dewey explained, "I think that it is pretty clear that the ordinance could not
                    retroact so as to emancipate a slave then in being—because no legislature can divest an
                    invested right." More importantly, Dewey noted the contradictions in legislation, which
                    were enthusiastically exploited by proslavery forces, that implied acceptance of slavery.
                    "That the existence of slavery after the passage of the Ordinance was contemplated by
                    Congress is certain, because that instrument repeatedly distinguishes between free and
                    bond—and so do the ordinances of 1800 and 1809—and the same distinction is
                    perceived through the whole course of our territorial legislation."<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>In Bob's case Dewey stated: "Decker claims Bob by the enclosed
                    indenture—and contends that he is bound to perform specifically—Perhaps the
                    claim may be favored by the analogy drawn from the authority which the common law gives the master
                    over the servant … But the doctrine is more strongly implied by a Statute in revised Code
                    341-344 which certainly implies that both master and servant shall perform
                        specifically."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

            <p>Stephen and Goodlet had, at some point after presenting their cases before Judge Raymond, cited the
                    antislavery provisions of the new Indiana Constitution, at least in their defense of Bob, for Dewey
                    argued: "We deny that the Constitution forbidding involuntary servitude has any thing to do
                    with this case; because, that service cannot be said to be involuntary, which the party has freely
                        <hi rend="i">contracted</hi> to … Nobody denies that an apprentice may be indebted to
                    serve until his majority, and yet this is certainly as much within the prohibition of the
                    constitution as the case in question." Adding his opinion, he stated, "It is most
                    evidently for the benefit of this class of people, as well as for the whole community that they
                    should be enabled to make contracts for labor; it is all that can save them from
                    pauperism—but who will contract with them unless a specific performance can be

            <p>Decker's cases were finally decided sometime in 1822. An excerpt from the summary in <hi rend="i">History of Pike and Dubois Counties, Indiana</hi> states, "Thus, after nearly
                    five years of contest, the case was decided before J. R. E. Goodlet, Henry Brenton, and T. J.
                    Withers, that Bob and Anthony should not be held, and that Luke Decker should pay the costs of the
                        suit."<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Unfortunately, further details are missing, but any
                    decision would have been a legal formality. Bob, under an indenture agreement that expired in
                    September, 1819, was no longer bound to serve, and his name does not appear on documents after that
                    date. Anthony would have been legally free after the State Supreme Court ruling in 1820. Both men
                    had apparently been in the custody of the sheriff of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Decker's cases against Bob and Anthony did not result in landmark decisions to abolish
                    slavery and indentured servitude in Indiana, nor did they bring recognition to those in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName> who were courageous enough to confront a man of Decker's reputation. They did
                    not even stop Decker from trading in slaves. Nonetheless, the cases do demonstrate the political and
                    regional dimensions of the slavery problem in the early years of the state, the determination of
                    slave owners to keep their slaves, and the equal determination of those against slavery to free the
                    victims of the practice.</p>
            <p>Attorneys for both parties employed arguments that had been used for decades in debating the legality
                    of slavery. Little is known about the background of Bob and Anthony; yet Stephen and Goodlet could
                    claim that Bob had been a slave before signing his indenture agreement, which was likely, and that
                    Anthony had been born after 1787. They could thus cite Article VI of the Ordinance of 1787 on behalf
                    of both men. Since the Indiana Constitution of 1816 reaffirmed the Northwest Ordinance's
                    antislavery provisions, it is surprising that Stephen and Goodlet did not initially cite <hi rend="i">both</hi> documents on behalf of the plaintiffs. To circumvent the restrictions against
                    slavery Harrison and the proslavery element in the territory had legalized indenture agreements
                    contracted with slaves. <list type="footnotes">

                            Bob and Anthony were not physically present, it was agreed by attorneys for both parties

                    Decker's attorneys argued that their client could claim Bob because the act repealing the
                    laws was not retroactive. For this reason they could also claim that he was bound to serve as
                    specified in the 1807 act concerning servants. Even the new Constitution implied that indentures
                    made before 1816 were valid.</p>
            <p>Congress had never specified the special privileges granted to the original inhabitants of Indiana
                    Territory by the clause from the Virginia Act of Session, but as Dewey noted, the proslavery element
                    interpreted the statement to mean that property in slaves was their vested right. That property was
                    then bequeathed to the next generation as a way of circumventing Article VI. Luke Decker's
                    claim to Anthony conformed to this interpretation. Decker's father was cited as the
                    original inhabitant rather than Luke himself so that the son's inheritance of Rach (and
                    Anthony) could be proven with his father's will. Luke Decker, of course, was also an
                    original inhabitant and a former resident of Virginia and along with his father had purchased Rach
                    "and her children and their future issue" before coming to Vincennes.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> There is no way of knowing if Anthony was related to Rach. Dewey also
                    employed other arguments that were frequently used to justify slavery: that the Northwest Ordinance
                    was not retroactive and that it and subsequent territorial legislation implied acceptance of
                    slavery.</p>
            <p>Decker's cases were not the first in which the legality of slavery was challenged after the
                    Constitution went into effect. Raymond, as president judge of the First Circuit, had presided over a
                    case in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> in October, 1816. The case was settled out of court in favor of the master.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Stephen and Goodlet challenged the legality of slavery, however, a good ten
                    months before the freedom suits in Vincennes were begun. Unlike those suits, some of which were
                    forced in order to test the Constitution, Decker's cases against Bob and Anthony do not
                    appear to have been initiated in order to establish a legal precedent. Rather, Stephen and Goodlet
                    sought the freedom of the men involved.</p>

                    in the home of an antislavery Quaker, even if he did post bond to the contrary. In maneuvering the
                    cases into the proslavery part of the state, the defense had no doubt counted on a change of venue
                    to <placeName>

                    and Anthony failed to appear in court. Realizing that a fair trial was impossible under those
                    circumstances, Stephen and Goodlet requested a change of venue to a circuit where citizens were more
                    sympathetic to their cause. Perhaps by seeking a court in the eastern part of the state, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>, far from witnesses, they invited reversal of their strategy on legal technicalities.

                    another postponement because Bob and Anthony were not present.</p>
            <p>The Lindleys, Stephen, and Goodlet had won a quiet victory in April, 1817, when Decker had to

                    for events occurring after October, 1818, are apparently not extant, it is probable that the cases
                    were delayed by technicalities until decided by formality in 1822. By October, 1818, Decker had
                    nothing to gain in continuing the cases anyway. Harry and two other slaves were gone in Mississippi,
                    and Bob and Anthony were out of reach in <placeName>

                    Purcell won a judgment against Decker, who refused to pay. Decker countersued in 1824 when
                    Purcell's attorney ordered a writ of execution against Decker's property.
                    Ironically, Decker and Judah cited the antislavery provisions of the new Constitution to support
                    their case: that at the time of sale slavery was illegal; therefore, the promissory note was
                    invalid. Purcell changed his story, claiming that Decker had not signed the note as security but was
                    the principal obligor. Furthermore, he said, Coons had not sold "slaves" but the
                    "services" of three girls who were the daughters of an indentured servant
                    belonging to Purcell's father.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Decker died in March, 1825, while the
                    case was still in progress. To settle the estate, Decker's son John filed a bill of
                    revival. The case was dismissed in August, 1826, Purcell paying the costs of the suit.</p>

            <p rend="center">Author's End Note</p>
            <p>The story of Luke Decker and Bob and Anthony began several years ago with the discovery of a
                    collection of old Indiana documents and letters in a relative's attic in Washington, D. C.
                    Among the papers, which had belonged to former Indiana lawyer and governor, Albert G. Porter
                    (1824-1897), the author found John Decker's will, Charles Dewey's letter to David
                    Raymond, and the court summary of the 1826 cases, <hi rend="i">Decker v. Purcell</hi>. Though a
                    synopsis of Decker's cases with Bob and Anthony appeared in the <hi rend="i">History of
                        Pike and Dubois Counties, Indiana</hi> (Chicago, 1885), the author was not encouraged to pursue
                    the proceedings until Eric Pumroy, then in charge of manuscripts at the Indiana Historical Society
                    Library, Indianapolis, discovered Bob's and Anthony's pleas and Luke
                    Decker's returns to those pleas in some <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName> court documents among Porter's papers at the Indiana State Library,
                    Indianapolis. Responding to two desperate letters from a stranger, Mrs. Frank Mallott, <placeName>

                    </placeName> historian in Petersburg, Indiana, persevered until she had uncovered twenty-nine
                    original circuit court documents related to the case. The chronology of the case then began slowly
                    to unfold. When the published genealogical record of the Decker family proved inconsistent with the
                    documents in the author's possession, and a major roadblock, Herbert Smith of Lawrenceburg,
                    Indiana, a descendant of the Kuykendall family, came to the rescue. The author is especially
                    indebted to Pumroy for assistance with research and also to Mallott and Smith. Without their
                    patience, especially during the two years the author lived in Florence, Italy, when everything had
                    to be done via the international mails, this paper could not have been completed.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>

            <p>When the American Civil War erupted in the spring of 1861, members of the small religious sect known
                    as the Society of Friends (or Quakers) struggled to preserve their traditional antiwar beliefs in
                    the highly charged environment while, simultaneously, sustaining loyalty to President Abraham
                    Lincoln's administration. Quaker doctrine stressed nonviolent means to settle disputes.
                    Although theoretically opposition to armed hostility could be implemented within the embrace of the
                    Society, Friends knew from past history that in a real crisis such convictions were often clouded by
                    governmental needs and demands. Within that context some Friends, albeit repeatedly admonished by
                    their yearly meetings to avoid warlike overtures, abandoned, at least temporarily, the cornerstone
                    of two-hundred-year-old pacifist dogma and enrolled for military duty.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Daniel
                    Wooton was one such Friend.</p>
            <p>Born circa 1838, Wooton was reared in a Quaker environment in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, the home of the largest number of Quaker monthly meetings in the state. He
                    belonged to New Garden Monthly Meeting near Newport, now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fountain City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in east central Indiana. He volunteered for military duty in August, 1861, in Company
                    C, Forty-first Indiana Regiment, Second Cavalry and rose to the rank of second lieutenant. Briefly,
                    Wooton's major military engagements with the Forty-first Regiment, Indiana's first
                    complete cavalry unit, included the battle of Pittsburg Landing (Shiloh), the siege of Corinth, and
                    the occupation of Atlanta. As commissary of the second Brigade of Cavalry, Wooton then joined
                    General James H. Wilson for raids throughout Alabama and Georgia. The Quaker soldier reenlisted in
                    December, 1863, and remained <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Just prior to his initial enrollment and throughout the first two-and-one-half years of war, Wooton
                    wrote a series of fascinating letters to a school friend, Miriam Green, with whom he was obviously
                    in love. (Sadly, for Wooton, his affection was unrequited.) Two parallel narratives emerge from this
                    correspondence, which dated from April 26, 1861, to October 30, 1863. First of all, as was
                    characteristic of men in uniform who experienced combat for the first time, Wooton recounted the
                    everyday events of the war. He chronicled camp life, battles, and duties and conscientiously noted
                    his whereabouts. More significantly, however, Wooton's letters reveal considerable
                    introspection as he strove to resolve the Quaker antiwar tenet with his own involvement in the
                    hostilities. His personal two-year struggle, painstakingly recorded throughout his writings,
                    discloses more of the inner conflict confronted by Quakers during the Civil War than letters written
                    by most other Friends in uniform. The emerging portrait shows Wooton as a young man battling, on the
                    one hand, with his Quaker background relating to war and, on the other, with what he saw as the need
                    to defend the honor of the Union. Initially doubtful of his destiny, he matured over the course of
                    two years from an unsettled, naive soldier to a proud fighting man.</p>
            <p>In his first letter to Mell, written from Richmond, Indiana, soon after the fall of Fort Sumter,
                    Wooton contemplated enlistment: <text>

                                    was: if I join any company it will be a company of cavelry they are getting up in

                            made every effort to transcribe as precisely as possible the portions of Wooton's
                            letters that are quoted below. Wooton frequently did not begin sentences with capital
                            letters nor conclude them with periods; the transcriber has done the same, double-spacing
                            where necessary to facilitate reading. The author of the article has not corrected
                            Wooton's spelling, punctuation, or grammar nor placed [sic] after every error.
                            Arbitrary choices were sometimes unavoidable when deciding between commas, periods, or
                            colons and between upper and lower case letters. If Wooton's intent could not be
                            determined, the rules of modern grammar were followed. Obviously unintentional repetitions

            <p>Nearly two months later Wooton, though still a civilian, casually noted one of the prime motivators
                    for military enlistment during the Civil War—economics. Unemployment, intermittent
                    joblessness, low wages on the farm and in the factory, use of bounties in recruitment, and the
                    assurance of an income prompted many men to don uniforms. Wooton was no exception: <text>

            <p>Soon after this vehement refrain and religious analogy, Wooton joined the army, though not without
                    reservations. Initially, he fretted that Mell would think of him as one of the forsaken, but writing
                    from Camp Morton in Indianapolis in October, 1861, he expressed relief when "I recieved
                    your kind letter I found I was mistaken and I feel glad that I was mistaken."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> In a bittersweet mood, however, he continued: <text>

            <p>Wooton's morale plummeted in December, 1861, while he was bivouacked at Camp Bridgeland in
                    Kentucky. Camp immorality, loneliness, and boredom, coupled later with a case of the measles, caused
                    the young Quaker to reflect on the wisdom of his decision to become a soldier. Although Wooton
                    assured Mell that he had not changed much since his civilian days, he was clearly worried about what
                    effect the army might have on his moral character.</p>

               </text> Apparently lamenting the fact that he had spurned God's teachings in regard to war,
                    Wooton implied that he had made the wrong decision to fight for the Union. As he poignantly stated,
                    however, there was no turning back. By the middle of February, 1862, failure to receive letters from
                    home had plunged his morale to its lowest point. Rumors had spread that his regiment was ordered to
                    Oregon, and Dan seemed somewhat apprehensive about confronting western Indians and possibly losing
                    his scalp. In particular, Wooton feared that if he were slain his body either would not or could not
                    be sent home for proper burial. "But if a person should get his scalp taken down there
                    there would not be much chance for a person to be brought home. But that would not amount to much
                    any how."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three months later Wooton was camped near Corinth, Mississippi, and for the first time in his letters
                    to his school friend described life on the battlefield. Concerned less now about justifying his role
                    as a soldier, Wooton focused on the grisly consequences of <list type="footnotes">

                    explained the word "ambulence" to Mell: it was a "large spring wagon for

                    an experienced fighting man, Wooton accepted death and destruction as commonplace: <text>

               </text> Then in reference to tanning easily from the sun, Wooton admitted that he was content with a

                                    remains of some poor soldier gliding slowly by to be layed down in its narrow bed to

               </text> On a lighter note Wooton related his cooking arrangements. With a steady diet of
                    "hard bread beens potatoes rice coffee molasses bacon and corn-beef and fresh
                    beef," the men were ordered to keep one day's provisions cooked ahead in case the
                    company was called out. Whimsically, he wrote: "My kitchen is the broad blue sky for a roof
                    and the tall hills on either side for the walls on which to hang my cooking utensils. rather a
                    romantic kitchen think it aint."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For eight months beginning in June, 1862, Wooton served as clerk in hospitals near Corinth and
                    Nashville. While in Tennessee Dan learned that one of his brothers might be drafted, and he
                    responded to the distressing news. Having been in the army for over one year and having experienced
                    firsthand the horrors of combat, Dan, playing the role of protective kinsman, wanted no siblings to
                    risk their lives. At the same time, however, he saw the necessity of replenishing the ranks in order
                    to end the war. He scrawled: <text>

               </text> Wooton's appointment as hospital clerk was relatively uneventful. Except for a
                    three-hour battle at Stevenson, Alabama, his stay in Nashville was pleasant "for there are
                    plenty of Yankey ladies at our Hospt: to make the days pass off lively. every thing appear gay and

            <p>As the war dragged on in the spring and early summer of 1863, Confederate victories, especially the
                    Union disaster at Chancellors-ville, confirmed that hostilities would not soon end. With the fate of
                    the war seemingly in limbo, Wooton pondered openly his relationship with Mell. He dolefully
                    suspected that it would be another year before he could return home, "but I cincerely hope
                    not: But if it is my fortune I shall resign Cheerfully to my fate …[.] Wooton desperately
                    wanted Mell to write more letters and convey her feelings toward him. He wrote that he loved her and
                    anxiously needed reassurance that someone cared back home and eagerly awaited his return. Had Mell
                    "appreciated the worth of letters as we do in the army: away from friends home and all that
                    is dear to us (excepting the cause of our glorious country) …," Wooton penned,
                    she would probably write more often. He continued: "Now love is appreciated as highly in
                    the army by me as in civil life: And if I should not live to return home to you I would have the

            <p>By the late summer of 1863, in the wake of significant Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg,
                    Wooton had crossed his Rubicon. He was absolutely convinced that serving his country in the war was
                    the right course of action for him. He bore no regrets. Wooton confidently wrote of his remaining
                    time in service: <text>

               </text> In addition, Dan summed up what may have been the crux of his motivation and justification
                    for fighting. He nostalgically remembered a special evening with Mell very early in the war while he
                    was still a civilian. The memory prompted him to put his thoughts on paper. Pensively, he wrote: <text>
                  <body>
                     <div type="letter">
                        <p>Well do I remember that beautiful evening of which you have spoken and I will assure
                                    you Mell there was more than one thought revolving in my mind upon that sublime
                                    evening. There was my duty to my country, to my God and my friends at home, and the
                                    object was which should I serve first. So I came to the conclusion by serving my
                                    country I would be serving my <hi rend="i">God</hi> and friends also, there fore I
                                    resolved to enlist and risk my chances with that of my fellow soldiers: And to day I

            <p>Those few sentences, the most revealing lines Wooton or perhaps any other Indiana Quaker soldier
                    penned on the justification of war, climaxed his transformation. Wooton no longer doubted his
                    martial commitment. His reformation, however, had not come quickly or easily. Two-and-one-half years
                    of war—the highs and lows of victory and defeat coupled with loneliness, boredom,
                    homesickness, death, destruction, and hunger—slowed the reconciliation of his Quaker
                    background with his participation on the battlefield. Wooton's determination to continue as
                    a soldier, his conscientious conflict behind him, hinged on his faith that he would serve God by
                    supporting his country. Coincidentally, and with the aid of hindsight, Wooton's convictions
                    were resolved soon after the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, usually considered the
                    turning point of the war. As further evidence of Wooton's belief in the righteousness of
                    war, he reenlisted for three more years in December, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>With little more than one year remaining in the war, Wooton's letters abruptly stopped.
                    Apparently Mell broke off the one-sided romance soon after the soldier's October
                    correspondence. Ten months later Mell received a letter from "Cousin Emma" in
                    which Emma mentioned that Mell gave "Dan his walking papers." Emma felt that Mell
                    was "too good for him [Dan]."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The details of Wooton's life after the Civil War are sketchy. Soon after his discharge from
                    service in July, 1865, Wooton married Lydia J. Stratton in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. They had at least one child, a son, and moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico.
                    While there, Wooton developed a double hernia and applied for and received a pension under the
                    federal pension law enacted in 1890. Soon after his pension application was approved, Wooton, aged
                    fifty-three, was murdered by a gunshot wound at San Lorenzo Springs, New Mexico. Although a grand
                    jury was unable to determine the perpetrator of the crime, a local newspaper claimed that a Mexican,
                    who accused Wooton of taking 160 acres of government land from the rightful owner, was the assassin.
                    Wooton was buried in Albuquerque on October 16, 1891. His wife survived him and lived until her
                    death on October 6, 1923. She died in Los Angeles, California.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                        talked of his eight remaining months in the army: I am about ready "to retire from the

                        Radicalism, 1890–1912</hi>. By Elliott Shore. (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas,
                    1988. Pp. xi, 280. Illustrations, appendixes, notes, bibliographical note, bibliography, index.
                    $25.00.)</head>
            <p>Who was the most famous Indiana-bred American socialist in the first decade of the twentieth century?
                    Today the answer to that question is easy: Eugene V. Debs. In 1910, however, the answer for many
                    radicals might well have been J. A. Wayland. From 1895 to 1912 Wayland was the publisher of the <hi rend="i">Appeal to Reason</hi>, the greatest American socialist newspaper of all time and one of
                    the largest weeklies of any kind in its era. Although Wayland is largely forgotten today, no other
                    American socialist, including Debs, spoke to more people or touched more lives. Indeed, Wayland was
                    the first (and perhaps the last) socialist in America to master the media of mass communication.</p>
            <p>Although Wayland began his publishing career in Indiana (he founded the radical populist paper <hi rend="i">The Coming Nation</hi> in Greens-burg in 1893), his greatest success came as publisher
                    of the <hi rend="i">Appeal to Reason</hi> in Girard, Kansas. The Indiana connection and the Debs
                    comparison, however, provide an interesting insight into the nature of American socialism. Debs and
                    Wayland represent two separate streams of indigenous American radicalism. Debs came out of the labor
                    movement; Wayland came out of the small entrepreneurial business tradition. Both were horrified by
                    the concentration of economic power in big capitalism at the end of the nineteenth century. Both
                    traced their socialism not to Marxism but to native American traditions of Jeffersonian
                    republicanism and equal rights radicalism. <hi rend="i">Talkin' Socialism</hi> is, then, an
                    excellent companion to Nick Salvatore's <hi rend="i">Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and
                    Socialist</hi> (1982). Together they paint a vivid picture of the origins of American
                    socialism—origins that lay in both labor and small business. That Indiana should have
                    given birth to two of the greatest representatives of these two traditions suggests how central the
                    Hoosier state was to the great and wrenching economic transformation of late-nineteenth-century
                    America. The fact that both these leaders could grow up in a state that would later become a bastion
                    of the modern Republican party suggests something important about both the rise and the fall of
                    socialism in America.</p>
            <p>Better than any previous study, Elliott Shore's <hi rend="i">Talkin' Socialism</hi>
                    describes the nature of the American socialism that developed out of small business. Wayland was a
                    sharp business operator, a <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-085-1-065"/> real estate speculator, a bottom-line
                    man, who grew rich running a popular mass-circulation newspaper. He was an American individualist
                    who saw in the age of trusts and monopolies the death of individual independence. His style of
                    socialism was not anti-free market or anti-free enterprise; it was merely anticapitalist. It brought
                    together old Jeffersonians and classical republicans, monetary reformers and Edward Bellamy
                    nationalists, abolitionists and Populists. Shore does a wonderful job of using Wayland's
                    career to show how these tributaries came together to form a major stream of native American
                    socialism.</p>
            <p>The commitment to both business and socialism created fundamental contradictions for Wayland and his
                    newspaper and for the larger socialist movement. Shore is at his best in exploring these
                    contradictions. What Wayland proposed to do was to beat capitalism at its own game, to beat big
                    capital with big socialism. To this end he made the <hi rend="i">Appeal to Reason</hi> into a major
                    medium of mass communication—with sensationalism, advertising, subscription contests and
                    premiums, and all the other trappings of the modern popular press. Was it ultimately a good strategy
                    to try to sell socialism through the techniques of modern capitalist advertising and promotion? What
                    happened when socialism was brought into the new popular culture of consumption and mass media?
                    Shore explores these fascinating questions in his thoughtful, well-researched, well-written book,
                    and his answers provide a fresh and important contribution to the long-standing discussion of why
                    socialism failed in America. <hi rend="i">Talkin' Socialism</hi> makes it clear that at
                    least part of the reason lay at the intersection of American radicalism and American popular
                    culture. Indeed, it was a fateful decision for American socialism to buy stock in the American
                    dream.</p>

                    scholars have come to understand the importance of the fieldwork and materials of folklore in
                    uncovering meaning in past events.</p>
            <p>Recent historiography has paid increased attention to the interrelationships between written, oral,
                    and material evidence. During this twenty-year period scholars have employed the systematic study of
                    material culture to add to the investigation of past history and culture. Bronner's work,
                        <hi rend="i">Chain Carvers: Old Men Crafting Meaning</hi>, is an important contribution to this
                    historiography. In this study Bronner, a former student of the Folklore Institute at Indiana
                    University, presents the findings of his fieldwork conducted primarily with wood-carvers in southern
                    Indiana. The author illustrates his examination with photographs of his informants and their work
                    and with extensive quotations from them regarding their thoughts about themselves and the reasons
                    why they carve, or articulate, their expressions into the wood. All of this material will be
                    interesting to the student of history, folklore, and material culture inasmuch as the text of
                    Bronner's work and his own conclusions are, of course, intimately tied to the material
                    culture evidence.</p>
            <p>Bronner divides his study into three chapters and an epilogue. The first chapter, "Part of
                    You Is in a Carving," presents short biographies of the author's major informants
                    and explores their self-conscious reasons for creating objects out of wood. Chapter two,
                    "Bet You Don't Know How I Made This," outlines the mechanical aspects of
                    the informants' wood carvings, the tools and woods used in carving, and the
                    informants' "secrets" in making chains and caged balls out of one piece
                    of wood. The title of this chapter is revealing in that wood-carvers often seek audience attention
                    by asking of the observer, "Do you know how I made this?" Finally, in
                    "How Do You Figure It, That Darn Stuff?" Bronner attempts to uncover the personal,
                    psychological, and sociological meanings embedded in these wood carvings. The book successfully
                    reveals the world of the wood-carver. Through Bronner's study the reader can understand and
                    imagine the activity and aspirations involved in carving wood.</p>
            <p>The importance of material culture to the study of American communities, regionalism, and local
                    history cannot be underestimated. Bronner's work illustrates how the scholar can use
                    field-work in a locality to explore the history of a region. Using the material artifacts of the
                    carvings, the author carefully dissects the informants' responses to illustrate societal
                    tensions that make wood carving a reasonable and appropriate activity, primarily for men, in a
                    changing universe where there is, increasingly, an uncertain sense of personal identity.</p>
            <p>Bronner notes that "creativity is another voice speaking your mind" (p. 156). He
                    thus recognizes that the wood-carvers are attempting with their carving to resolve their own
                    tensions through <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-085-1-068"/> a well-understood, creative activity inherited
                    from previous generations. In his text the author cites his work with Glen Van Antwerp, a young
                    wood-carver from East Lansing, Michigan. In this reviewer's own fieldwork with Van Antwerp
                    during 1987-1988, the carver stressed the historical connection between wood carving and his family
                    history in northern Michigan where logging during the day gave way to wood carving at night. For Van
                    Antwerp wood carving is a meaningful social and historical expression within the culture.</p>
            <p>Bronner includes in <hi rend="i">Chain Carvers</hi> a very helpful bibliography that will interest
                    students of history, folklore, and material culture. His notes contribute to a better understanding
                    of some of the bibliographic history involved in material culture study. <hi rend="i">Chain
                    Carvers</hi>, finally, provides useful historical information for students of Indiana and midwestern
                    history.</p>

            <p>About one-fifth of the soldiers serving in the Union armies in the Civil War were foreign-born, and
                    many of these men joined distinctive ethnic regiments, most of which were either Irish or German.
                    One of the best-known German regiments was the Ninth <placeName>

                    objective is to tout the German contribution to the Civil War, a contribution that he believes has
                    been slighted despite the large literature on the subject. His introduction explains the background
                    of the regiment and the preparation of <hi rend="i">"Die Neuner</hi>," and

                    </placeName> had a distinguished record. Its founding fathers included Judge Johann B. Stallo, a
                    renowned philosopher as well as a pillar of the German community in Cincinnati, and Robert <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-085-1-069"/> L. McCook, Stallo's law partner and one of the famous
                    "Fighting McCooks." Military expertise for the regiment's training came
                    from an ex-Prussian officer and Forty-eighter exile, Augustus Willich. Between its formation in
                    Cincinnati in April, 1861, and its mustering out there more than three years later, "Die
                    Nuener" enjoyed popular community support, won laurels on several major campaigns and
                    battlefields, and earned national admiration for its role in the Battle of Chickamauga. At

            <p>"<hi rend="i">We Were The Ninth</hi>" is a curious book. It is not a history so
                    much as a collective memoir. Author Constantin Grebner was not a member of the outfit, but he wrote
                    the narrative in a first-person style as if he were a witness to and a participant in the events
                    described. He used newspapers and documents, but much of his information came from interviews with
                    veteran survivors, years after the war. These reminiscences, collected and arranged by Grebner near
                    the end of the century, are a classic example of filiopietism. Their greatest value lies in the
                    numerous anecdotes of military life at the level of the common soldier.</p>
            <p>There is an Indiana connection. Augustus Willich, described by Ella Lonn as one of the most appealing

            <p>During the past ten to fifteen years encyclopedias of political history, southern history, and
                    western history as well as dictionaries and almanacs of the Civil War, World War II, and the Vietnam
                    War have appeared on bookshelves as publishers and historians have warmed to the possibilities of
                    fact-filled, special-purpose reference works. David D. Van Tassel and John J. Grabowski have carried
                    the fashion for such works one step further by compiling the first encyclopedia dedicated to the
                    history of a single city. An obvious labor of love, their <hi rend="i">Encyclopedia of Cleveland
                        History</hi> offers just about everything any aficionado of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> metropolis would want to know. Moreover, it provides a model for other students of
                    local history who may want to perform an equal service to their city.</p>
            <p>With over 2,500 articles filling more than 1,000 double-columned pages, the work of Van Tassel,
                    Grabowski, and more than <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-085-1-070"/> 250 other contributors is truly
                    encyclopedic. About 2,300 of the articles are short entries limited to four hundred words each.
                    These sketches describe the history of hundreds of local businesses, leaders, and institutions. In
                    fact, the breadth of coverage is awesome, and it also reflects the richness of the city's
                    diverse past. For example, the encyclopedia portrays Cleveland's ethnic heritage. Included
                    are citations for such obscure groups as the Aitaneet Brotherhood Association, a society made up of
                    immigrants from Aitaneet, Lebanon, as well as accounts of such figures as Ivan Zorman, who lived in

                    </placeName> from age four but achieved his place in the encyclopedia because of his internationally
                    acclaimed poetry in the Slovene language. At first glance some may dismiss this volume as a
                    collection of trivia about a city that by the 1970s had become the butt of jokes throughout the
                    nation, yet the encyclopedia actually is a rich mine of material for the social historian as well as
                    the student of America's political and economic development.</p>
            <p>In addition to the short entries the encyclopedia includes 167 signed interpretative essays that
                    examine broader topics such as education, music, philanthropy, and religion. These entries as well
                    as the 40,000-word narrative history of the city at the beginning of the volume are invaluable
                    because they piece together myriad factual fragments to form a larger picture. Thus the editors have
                    successfully explored both the microcosm and macrocosm of Cleveland's past. Anyone
                    interested in urban history or local history certainly should consult this work. It is both a
                    monumental and a model effort.</p>

            <p>In 1684 René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle, undertook an expedition to found a French
                    colony on the Mississippi. This illfated mission has intrigued historians since Francis
                    Parkman's time. Although several accounts of both this venture and the explorer's
                    overland trek to the Mississippi delta in 1682 are well known, the answers to several important
                    questions concerning the leader's character, the choice of location of Fort Saint-Louis,
                    the assassination of La Salle, and the fate of the settlers remain unclear. The documents in this
                    volume help resolve some of these <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-085-1-071"/> problems, cast new light on
                    the experiences of these pioneers, and provide ethnographic data on the inhabitants of the
                        <geogName>Mississippi valley</geogName> and Texas.</p>
            <p>The first of the three documents in the volume under review records Minet's lengthy
                    shipboard conversations during the Atlantic crossing with two members of La Salle's first
                    expedition, Nicolas de La Salle and Gabriel Barbier. These conversations enabled Minet to write a
                    concise yet informative narrative of the 1682 journey down the Mississippi. Included were valuable
                    ethnographic data on the native peoples. The journal of the 1684-1685 voyage from France to
                    Matagorda Bay sheds light on the difficulties that plagued the second expedition and helps explain
                    the loss of La Salle's supply ships. Minet, who was to be the engineer for the new colony,
                    fell out with La Salle and returned to France where he was imprisoned. His recriminations against La
                    Salle are, therefore, certainly biased, but they nevertheless help historians to understand the
                    flaws in the explorer's character, flaws that contributed to the tragic outcome of this
                    1684 expedition.</p>
            <p>The second of the three documents is the diary of Juan Enríquez Barroto, chief pilot on
                    one of the eleven expeditions undertaken by the Spanish between 1685 and 1699 to locate the French
                    colony and arrest the interlopers. During a seven-month circumnavigation of the Gulf of Mexico, two
                    galleys traveled by day and were rarely out of sight of land. Written in 1687, Barroto's
                    journal contains descriptions of the coast, as well as the mouths of the Mississippi, and provides
                    an idea of living conditions on board these vessels. Although interesting with respect to sea
                    travel, it lacks the human drama of the other two documents and makes for dry reading.</p>
            <p>The final document is the 1698 interrogation of Pierre and Jean-Baptiste Talon, two survivors of the
                    settlement. In 1687, as a young boy, Pierre was taken to the Hasanai Indians to learn their language
                    and, after witnessing La Salle's assassination, spent three years living with the natives.
                    Jean-Baptiste remained at Fort Saint-Louis with his family until most of the adult settlers were
                    killed by the Karankawa in 1688. He was adopted into the tribe and remained with it until a Spanish
                    expedition brought both brothers to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mexico City</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1690. In 1697 they were captured by the French and were sent to France where the
                    authorities, preparing the Louisiana settlement of Pierre le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville,
                    questioned them on their experience. Although their young age and the long interval between the
                    events and the interrogation must have clouded some memories, they were able to give important
                    information on the final phase of La Salle's expedition. Their story, although not
                    conclusive, helps to clarify some heretofore puzzling points. The brothers also provided valuable
                    ethnographic and linguistic data on the native peoples of Texas.</p>

            <p>Informative introductions help put the three documents in perspective and underline each

                    the point. An exception is the statement that the Jesuits siphoned off much of the Indian trade (p.

                    ethnographic data; by Del Weniger on natural history; and by Rudolph C. Troike on linguistic data.</p>

            <p>The late Donald Jackson was an outstanding editor and a respected historian. Over the last three
                    decades he produced nearly twenty volumes of journals, letters, diaries, and histories. Among the
                    significant figures in American history about whom he has written are George Washington, Thomas
                    Jefferson, and George Armstrong Custer, but Jackson had a special interest in the lives of
                    Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and their magnificent expedition. His <hi rend="i">Letters of the
                        Lewis and Clark Expedition</hi> is a brilliant work of editing. <hi rend="i">Among the Sleeping
                        Giants</hi> does not, however, meet the high standards that Jackson had established in his
                    previous works. Perhaps because of his illness the work is a melange of casual comments, random
                    musings, and leftovers from earlier literary repasts.</p>
            <p>Following an introduction dealing with incidents that occurred at the mouth of the Yellowstone River
                    in 1805 are seven chapters, two of which have fewer than ten pages. There is a chapter entitled
                    "If the Spanish Had Captured Lewis and Clark" that incites other "what
                    ifs"—"What if Lewis and Clark Came Back by Sea?" and
                    "What if Lewis Had Not Become An Alcoholic?" The game of "what
                    if" is unending, if diverting; for example, what if Lewis and Clark had captured a Spanish
                    patrol? While this intellectual discussion might stimulate lethargic freshmen, it can easily be
                    overdone unless one possesses the wit of a James Thurber.</p>
            <p>Another chapter deals with Lewis's and Clark's search for volcanoes while a third
                    solves the question of the correct name for Lewis's dog. It appears that for seventy years
                    editors and historians have perpetuated the error that the Newfoundland's name was Scannon.
                    Jackson points out with some glee that its correct name was Seaman. Though it is nice to have things
                    set right, this emendation hardly merits a chapter.</p>
            <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-085-1-073"/>
            <p>The larger question is, of course, do these casual articles merit a book? While there is an engaging
                    reminiscence about the trials and tribulations of editing the Lewis and Clark letters, followed by
                    fifty pages on Lewis and Clark place-names in Montana, little else other than Jackson's
                    reputation warrants this volume.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Westfalians: From Germany to Missouri</hi>. By Walter D. Kamphoefner. (Princeton,
                    N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1987. Pp. xiv, 215. Notes, maps, tables, figures, appendixes,
                    index. $27.50.)</head>
            <p>A seemingly endless flow of Germans migrated to America in the nineteenth century and up to World War
                    I. Historian Walter D. Kamphoefner examines the emigration from Westfalia to St. Charles and Warren
                    counties, Missouri, before the Civil War. Although Westfalia appears in the title of this work, the
                    districts of neighboring provinces (Oldenburg and Hannover) are included, as they shared the same
                    socioeconomic conditions favorable for emigration and also shared the Low German language.</p>
            <p>Through the extensive use of emigration records; census, agricultural, and industrial statistics; and
                    manuscript collections, Kamphoefner draws a convincing portrait of the German emigrant. The landless
                    rural lower class used emigration as a means to reroot its traditional life while gaining
                    respectability and security through land ownership.</p>
            <p>During the 1830s the foundations of rural life in Germany were shaking loose. Prior to the industrial
                    revolution the German rural lower class made its living by farming and eked out its existence by
                    cottage industry. Kamphoefner states that "a feature common to all these areas of heavy
                    emigration was a well-developed cottage linen industry carried on by the rural lower class on a
                    part-time basis …" (p. 16). This part-time weaving was the domain of the <hi rend="i">Heuerling</hi> class, which owned no real estate but rented a cottage and a small plot
                    of land from a <hi rend="i">Kolon</hi>, or landed peasant. The <hi rend="i">Heuerling</hi> was also
                    obligated to provide the <hi rend="i">Kolon</hi> a fixed number of days of service. The competition
                    of Britain's industrialized cotton textile mills began to affect the <hi rend="i">Heuerling's</hi> livelihood, and the result was "misery and massive
                    emigration" (p. 20).</p>
            <p>Although the Heuerling and the rural independent artisans (mostly shoemakers and tailors not part of
                    the structured guild system) were impoverished, they were not destitute, for they were able to
                    secure funds for their emigration passage. If families did not have the funds to leave as a unit,
                    one or more members would emigrate and send for family members at a later date, arranging <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-085-1-074"/> for their passage and employment. This system of chain migration made
                    it possible for extended families and entire villages of landless to relocate in new settlements in
                    America and elsewhere, thus creating Low German colonies as news trickled back.</p>
            <p>Not all German emigrants of the early nineteenth century were from the landless rural class, but this
                    group came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in such great numbers that they shaped the character of the migration. The goal of
                    these emigrants was to own land. Few of the part-time weavers and artisans continued their old
                    crafts commercially after establishing themselves as farmers in Missouri. Cheap agricultural land in
                    America enabled the land-hungry emigrants to fulfill their dreams of owning property, establishing
                    an independent economic existence, and gaining respectability (pp. 168-69).</p>
            <p>Kamphoefner provides convincing statistical evidence in the numerous tables based on his German
                    sources. <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> population and agricultural censuses, as well as county histories, church histories,
                    and Missouri German-language newspapers, were used to track the emigrants after their settlement in
                    Missouri. Kamphoefner's work also challenges earlier ideas of the nature and results of
                    emigration. The author refutes the myth of the importance of emigration agents and their propaganda
                    as a major "influence on the volume or direction of migration" (p. 58). He
                    challenges Mack Walker's characterization of the pre-1865 emigrant as a middle-class landed
                    peasant or master craftsman (pp. 41, 45). Oscar Handlin's image of the uprooted immigrant
                    as disconnected and disoriented does not apply to Kamphoefner's north Germans in Missouri
                    (pp. 5, 199).</p>

                    immigration, ethnic, local, and family history. The reasons cited for emigration apply equally well
                    to the many north Germans who chose Indiana rather than Missouri and rerooted their way of life in
                    such places as Oldenburg, Huntersville, the White Creek area of Jackson and Bartholomew counties,
                    and other rural Indiana communities.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Great Triumvirate: Webster, Clay, and Calhoun</hi>. By Merrill D. Peterson. (New
                    York Oxford University Press, 1987. Pp. x, 573. Illustrations, notes, index. $27.95.)</head>
            <p>In this finely crafted narrative Merrill D. Peterson presents a compelling and informing collective
                    biography of the Great Triumvirate of nineteenth century American politics, Daniel Webster, <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-085-1-075"/> Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun. Together they dominated the
                    national scene from the War of 1812 until the great sectional crisis of 1850. Between those
                    benchmark years each served in the House, in the Senate, and as secretary of state (Webster in three
                    different administrations). Each hungered for the presidency, but it eluded them while those
                    perceived as lesser men took the coveted place. All three died between 1850 and 1852 as the union
                    they had helped shape began to disintegrate.</p>
            <p>Peterson chronicles the lives and times of the Great Triumvirate expertly and gracefully. His book is
                    old-fashioned narrative history in the grand style. He explains both well-known and minor events and
                    issues in a way that evokes the sense of the age and illuminates personalities. Using primary as
                    well as secondary sources, the author examines the careers of these three "master
                    spirits" (p. 234) and their relationships with each other. He develops a theme that none of
                    them felt equal to the greatness of the founding fathers but that all held it a self-imposed moral
                    duty to conserve the heritage they had received.</p>
            <p>Peterson seems to admire Webster least and Clay most. The Godlike Daniel in his view was "a
                    contrast between intellectual power and moral weakness, between patriotism and ambition, virtue and
                    venality, the genius of statesmanship and the artifice of politics" (p. 391). Calhoun had
                    "a tendency to turn his feelings into intellectual speculations, to become obsessed with
                    his ideas, and to push them to their ultimate conclusions, no matter how absurd" (p. 152).
                    In contrast Clay is praised for his "genius for accommodation, … sensitivity to
                    opposing political pressures, and his ingenuity in adapting old policies to new conditions"
                    (p. 230). Peterson's Clay emerges as a natural leader, dignified, self-possessed, and
                    courageous.</p>
            <p>The Civil War, Peterson argues, was a judgment on the Triumvirate. For Clay's memory the war
                    "offered grim proof of the limits of compromise"; for Webster it demonstrated the
                    fragility of law before "moral and social forces he never truly understood"; the
                    ruined South became "Calhoun's real monument" (pp. 495-96). Yet, as the
                    author shows, the three left another legacy. Webster helped define the concept of American
                    nationhood, Clay contributed to the art of pragmatic politics, and Calhoun shaped an imposing theory
                    of federalism. Together they remain "fixed figures in the American pantheon" (p.
                    499).</p>
            <p>This is a fine work by a master historian. All students of nineteenth century American history and
                    biography will value it.</p>

            <p>Salmon P. Chase, Free Soil senator, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> governor, secretary of the treasury under Lincoln, and chief justice of the Supreme
                    Court during Reconstruction, never doubted his own importance to history. Yet despite leaving
                    innumerable letters and diaries to document his career and encouraging two contemporaries, Jacob
                    Schuckers and John Trowbridge, to write his biography, Chase has, until now, attracted only one
                    scholarly biographer, Albert B. Hart in 1899. Twentieth century scholars of the Chase-era Supreme
                    Court and the Civil War financial system have offered important new judgments of Chase's
                    role; and with the recent appearance of a microfilm edition of Chase papers from University
                    Publications of America, which should widen access to Chase's ideas still further, it has
                    become more essential to have a modern biography of the man. Frederick J. Blue, who dealt
                    extensively with Chase in his earlier book, <hi rend="i">The Free Soilers</hi>, has now answered
                    this need.</p>
            <p>Blue sees Chase as a man whose political ambition, while undeniable, has been exaggerated.
                    Chase's real commitment, Blue believes, was to his ideals, especially antislavery, and his
                    ambition was a means to achieving that important end. As a politician Chase was unusually honest and
                    sufficiently naive that he could never organize the kind of national campaign necessary to win what
                    he desired most, a presidential nomination. In the end Chase had to be content to be remembered as a
                    hardworking administrator during a period of acute national crisis.</p>
            <p>The strength of Blue's biography lies in its careful mining of the Chase papers. In other
                    respects, however, it is surprisingly weak. The psychology of the man remains unexplored. Nor,
                    despite the book's subtitle, is Chase's life placed in a broader political
                    context. There is no discussion of the political values and culture that made it so difficult for
                    Chase to realize his personal ambitions. Like John C. Calhoun in the South, Chase was a man whose
                    beliefs did not accord well with any of the political parties of his day. While his independence
                    repelled politicians for whom party loyalty and regularity were sacred, it also made him attractive
                    as a candidate who might swing malcontents to the side of a weaker party. Chase, however, rarely won
                    the loyalty accorded to more conventional partisans, men often far inferior to him in talents and
                    character. It is this larger reason for the rejection of Chase that Blue fails to develop in what is
                    otherwise a solid, political biography.</p>

            <p>The story behind the writing of Mark E. Neely and R. Gerald McMurtry's <hi rend="i">The
                        Insanity File</hi> is almost as fascinating as the details that the book reveals about Mary Todd
                    Lincoln's involuntary civil commitment trial. Shortly before his death Robert Todd Lincoln
                    Beckwith, the last surviving direct descendant of the Lincoln family, decided to make available to
                    scholars the news clippings and legal briefs collected by his grandfather, Robert Todd Lincoln, and
                    labeled "MTL Insanity Trial." Beckwith asked the well-known Lincoln scholars,
                    Neely and McMurtry, to publish these materials in the hope that they would persuade readers to think
                    more kindly of both his great-grandmother and his grandfather. Every researcher will identify with
                    Neely and McMurtry's excitement, eloquently decribed in their preface, as they read through
                    the longhidden documents during predinner cocktails at Beckwith's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> farmhouse. That excitement served to sustain the two during the long months that
                    followed when they found themselves scrambling to acquire expertise in areas of medical and legal
                    history remote from their own training.</p>
            <p>As a result, Neely and McMurtry's view of the Lincoln insanity trial considers not only the
                    conflict between mother and son but also the intense nineteenth century debate about involuntary
                    civil commitment laws and the value of institutional care for the mentally ill. The result is a book
                    of interest to specialists in American history as well as to general readers fascinated by the
                    tragic lives of the Lincoln family and in particular of the "pathetic remnant" (p.
                    xiii) who survived the Civil War only to fall apart when, in 1875, Robert forced his
                    mother's commitment to an <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> insane asylum.</p>
            <p>The most valuable part of this book is the insight it offers into Robert Lincoln, a rigid and not
                    always likeable man but one who clearly agonized over his mother's unpredictable behavior
                    and feared for her safety. Thus, the authors decribe in much detail the reasons why he decided to
                    commit his mother, and they defend the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> legal procedure under which she was committed. At the same time they admit that the
                    relatively quick release of Mary Lincoln, under an "interdiction" that permitted
                    outside supervision of her finances, was more appropriate than institutionalization.</p>
            <p>An interesting complement to Neely and McMurtry's presentation is Jean H. Baker's
                    biography, <hi rend="i">Mary Todd Lincoln</hi> (1987). Relying upon many of the same sources, Baker
                    looks at the insanity trial from the perspective of the mother, not the son. Not surprisingly, she
                    sees it somewhat differently than do Neely and <pb n="[72]" id="VAA4025-085-1-078"/>

                    husband's death approached, Mary Lincoln suffered enormous depression and migraine
                    headaches, for which she took doses of chloral hydrate large enough to explain at least some of her
                    behavioral extremes. Even though Baker describes Mary Lincoln as "both unwilling victim and
                    … an agent provocateur" (p. 332) during the months leading up to her trial, she
                    remains highly critical of that trial, noting that the beleaguered woman was inadequately defended
                    and that the doctors who pronounced on her health were Robert Lincoln's friends and had
                    never personally examined her.</p>
            <p>Both works conclude with negative comments on the inadequacy of nineteenth century institutional
                    solutions to mental illness. Read together, they convey the essential fascination of the
                    historian's task: the unraveling of puzzles to which there seem to be no end. Was Mary Todd
                    Lincoln merely a sad victim of her son's (and the culture's) increasing
                    intolerance of eccentricity? Did her depressions come dangerously close to threatening her life? How
                    embarrassed was Robert Todd Lincoln by his mother's bizarre dress and fiscal
                    irresponsibility? What emotional damages had he suffered from the tragic deaths of his father and
                    three brothers? Readers interested in such questions will want to read both of these books.</p>

                    &amp; Company, 1987. Pp. xv, 429. Illustrations, notes, index. $19.95.)</head>
            <p>Unlike most women of her time, Mary Todd Lincoln looked at her life in terms of wins and losses and
                    scored them both in bold relief. Unfortunately for her and those around her, the defeats greatly
                    outnumbered the victories. An exceptional woman of many aspirations and one who enjoyed being
                    different, Mary Lincoln became a victim of a series of personal tragedies or
                    "abandonments" and an array of "destructive conventions of Victorian
                    domesticity" (p. xv).</p>
            <p>Perhaps Mary Lincoln's fascination with politics made her view her life in such an
                    "unwomanly" way. In Lexington, Kentucky, as a girl, she had used politics to
                    foster a relationship with her father; years later, in Springfield, Illinois, politics provided the
                    background for an on-again-off-again courtship with Abraham Lincoln. Independent, educated, and
                    articulate, Mary Lincoln often listened to long speeches on the courthouse square and regularly
                    talked about issues in the offices of the Sangamon <hi rend="i">Journal.</hi> Before mar- <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-085-1-080"/> rying Lincoln she had been courted by others active in
                    Springfield's political life, including Stephen A. Douglas. In the end, however, she
                    married a man "of potential majesty" (p. 93), one who during the fall of 1842 gave
                    her a list of election returns for the last three legislative races. Although few women would have
                    appreciated this gift, Mary Lincoln "tied it in a pink ribbon" (p. 94) and
                    cherished it.</p>
            <p>Jean H. Baker, who teaches history at Goucher College, tells the story of Mary Todd
                    Lincoln's life in an honest but sympathetic manner. She spends a good deal of the first
                    part of the book showing how Mary Lincoln's character was shaped by her experiences as a
                    member of the Todd family, highlighting in particular the painful death of her mother and the
                    subsequent hostility of her stepmother. Besides emphasizing her subject's genuine interest
                    in politics, the author also portrays Mary Todd Lincoln as a loving, often indulgent, mother; and,
                    once in the White House, as "full of the smiles and lively conversation that were her
                    hallmark" (p. 165). Baker describes the energetic and extravagant way she carried out her
                    duties—redecorating and refurbishing the President's House, entertaining
                    Washington politicians and visiting citizens, and buying elegant clothes for lavish receptions. Mary
                    Lincoln had become the "First Lady," and she enjoyed her new role and the
                    attention it brought. As luck would have it, however, she won her position at a time not only when
                    Americans expected wives to remain out of the spotlight but also when a divided country was worried
                    about the cost of war.</p>
            <p>In February, 1862, two weeks after a superb party, Mary Lincoln's good times and good
                    fortune took an abrupt turn for the worse with the death of her eleven-year-old son Willie. His
                    demise from typhoid fever, his mother believed, resulted from her merrymaking in the White House.
                    Three years later, when her husband was assassinated at Ford's Theater, she again held
                    herself responsible for the loss. Her ambitions for him had cost his life. An overwhelmed Mary
                    Lincoln, who had a knack for doing "the wrong thing well" (p. 40), made a
                    spectacle of herself through an extended period of grieving, a heavy reliance on spiritualism,
                    continuous battles with members of Congress over a pension, travels hither and yon in search of
                    cures for her illnesses, and a humiliating attempt to sell her wardrobe through a public sale in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>All of these events make for compelling reading. It is the penultimate chapter on Mary
                    Lincoln's "Trial and Confinement," however, that leaves one astonished.
                    The wretched insanity laws coupled with the lamentable actions of son Robert intermittently evoke
                    feelings of sympathy and respect for a woman who could be exceedingly trying. Had she had a
                    daughter, one wonders, would Mary Lincoln's losses of a husband and three sons have been so
                    crushing?</p>
            <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-085-1-081"/>
            <p>Baker has written a fascinating study of a difficult woman. It successfully combines the usual
                    elements of political biography with newer themes in social history. Discussions of such topics as
                    nineteenth century childbirth practices, domesticity, mourning customs, spiritualism, and mental
                    illness interwoven with heartbreaking episodes in Mary Lincoln's life provide for a
                    strikingly perceptive biography of a maligned First Lady.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Freedom.</hi> By William Safire. (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday &amp; Company,
                    Inc., 1987. Pp. xxi, 1125. End maps, illustrations; Underbook: Sources and Commentary.
                    $24.95.)</head>
            <p>The sight of William Safire's 1125-page book on this reviewer's desk provoked a
                    friend to remark that it looked like <hi rend="i">War and Peace.</hi> Both are very large volumes;
                    no other significant parallels may be drawn. Leo Tolstoy took the institutionalization of human rage
                    and raised it to the level of an anagogical examination of an aspect of the "human
                    condition." Safire, laboring upon so elevated a title as <hi rend="i">Freedom, rarely</hi>
                    escapes from a preoccupation with personalities.</p>
            <p>The publisher has announced Safire's work as "a novel of Abraham Lincoln and the
                    Civil War." The narrative actually ends with the Emancipation Proclamation (which brought
                    freedom to no one) and so follows events only to January, 1863. Upon the war itself, however, the
                    author reveals a disconcerting lack of accuracy. Civil War scholars will be jolted to find Safire
                    imagining that it was General William Farah ("Baldy") Smith who commanded Ulysses
                    S. Grant's left at Fort Donelson, while all observers of the battle remark upon the stark
                    visibility, during that struggle in the darkness, of the flowing, snow white hair of that grand old
                    warrior, General Charles Ferguson Smith. Smiths, with apologies to the race, are easy enough to
                    confuse and so, probably, are Hills (in describing their respective personalities Safire has
                    manifestly confused A. P. Hill with D. H. Hill); but it is difficult to understand how the author
                    can think that the infamous Confederate penitentiary, Libby Prison, located in Richmond, Virginia,
                    was operated by the Union. "The hellhole every Johnny dreaded," he christens it,
                    in comparing it unfavorably to "the South's own Andersonville," which did
                    not come into existence until November of the following year (p. 797). While a certain, though
                    undefined, license is allowed the historical novelist, factual errors of this sort—there
                    are others—seriously vitiate enjoyment of the book.</p>
            <p>But a reassessment of military operations is not Safire's first purpose. The focus of his
                    effort is an examination of the mind of <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-085-1-082"/> America as it groped its
                    way forward to a resolution of the enormously involuted issue of slavery. He uses his characters,
                    often in artificial situations, to debate the matter from every motive: highest idealism, arresting
                    practicality, and basest opportunism. This aspect of the book is its most redeeming feature. The
                    elements of the debate are handled with a lucidity that makes clear the complexity of the matter
                    while presenting the bewildering ambivalences that informed each of the several approaches to its
                    solution. It has the fascination of a championship chess match.</p>
            <p>Though disproportionately brief, one of the best chapters in the book (chapter 14, of book 9) brings
                    Horatio Seymour and Abraham Lincoln together in the White House to debate the constitutional issues
                    produced by the war. Military arrests, suppressed newspapers, and the suspension of habeas corpus,
                    in short, the anomaly of saving the nation through the surrender of its most precious institutions,
                    is the topic of this useful, though abbreviated, argument between the president and the governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, all of these discussions remain locked exclusively in the context of
                    mid-nineteenth-century America. The author never raises the universal implications buried in the
                    search for a solution to the "peculiar institution." Safire has chosen to ignore
                    the basic trade-off of freedoms <hi rend="i">from</hi> against freedoms <hi rend="i">to</hi> and the
                    "awful gift of a choice," respecting which Dostoyevsky declared, through the voice
                    of the Prince of Darkness, "nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human
                    society than freedom." He also seems strangely indifferent to the human subjects at the
                    heart of the matter, the blacks themselves. Is his concern the way in which white America liberated
                    itself from slavery rather than the actual liberation of the black slaves, whose subsequent
                    condition was to remain so long a matter of the greatest indifference to the nation that had fought
                    one of the world's most violent civil wars to free them?</p>
            <p>In his treatment of the president, Safire has followed the direction recently taken by Gore Vidal in
                    his historical novel, <hi rend="i">Lincoln</hi> (1984), in which Vidal reduces Lincoln to the
                    proportions of an earthly verisimilitude. Safire's Lincoln emerges as a practical man of
                    basically gentle and kindly disposition whose conduct in office was shaped by practical
                    considerations as well as humane and even religious motives. Lincoln grows as he struggles to find
                    the passable wind-cuts through the looming obstacles cast athwart his path. His fundamental decency
                    is his preferred guide, but he is never blind to the tumultuous political forces surging about him
                    and the manner in which they will affect his personal fortunes.</p>
            <p>Among Safire's most useful devices is his inclusion of what he calls the
                    "Underbook." At the back of his novel he has added a 133-page <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-085-1-083"/> chapter-by-chapter discussion of the sources used and whether and in
                    what way they have been fictionalized.</p>
            <p>Safire is a good writer, and the tale is well told. His book, however, does not address itself to
                    individuals who are tightly informed on the period.</p>

                    felonious acts. The author begins with the critical assumption that how a society defines crime, how
                    citizens react to it, and what ideological functions their images of the criminal world serve are
                    socially constructed. The meanings that individuals ascribe to particular criminal
                    acts—murders, riots, or burglaries, for example—vary according to culture,
                    class, and religion, to name only a few factors.</p>
            <p>Although Papke is a professor of law, <hi rend="i">Framing the Criminal</hi> is very much a study of
                    language and rhetoric, based in part on ideas and methods borrowed from literary criticism. Indeed,
                    the very phrase "framing the criminal" is a play on words. To label a man a
                    criminal was to frame him (as in "I've been framed"), for the term
                    implied that personal weakness, not social conditions, explained felonious behavior. The word <hi rend="i">frame</hi>, however, also has currency in modern criticism because it denotes the
                    social and cultural context that gives larger significance to specific events. To get at popular
                    attitudes toward crime, Papke dwells mainly in the realm of subliterature, viewing these texts
                    through the prism of Victorian ideology. As he notes, nineteenth century newspapers, broadsides,
                    murder mysteries, cheap tracts, police memoirs, detective fiction, and convict autobiographies
                    shaped Americans' perceptions of crime and criminality and defined those terms for them,
                    thus, framing the criminal.</p>
            <p>Chapters in this volume are organized around the development of particular genres of crime reporting.
                    Papke traces a progression through time from the early decades of the nineteenth century through its
                    end, shows how conceptions of crime changed, <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-085-1-084"/> and reveals that
                    criminals as depicted in popular literature became inverted images of all that a modernizing
                    capitalist society valued. The author is at his best when he describes the ways in which conceptions
                    of crime defined by negation what members of a modern society must not be—impulsive,
                    violent, destructive of other's property, irresponsible.</p>
            <p>Despite its strengths <hi rend="i">Framing the Criminal</hi> is plagued by serious flaws. The writing
                    is generally flat, occasionally pretentious. The author delivers less than he promises, for the
                    supposed "critical perspective" that was present in the early nineteenth
                    century—the ability of some citizens to see criminality as economically and politically
                    generated and therefore to condemn the social evils underlying crime rather than criminals
                    themselves—is only lightly documented. One need only read a few broadside murder ballads
                    from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to know that then as now crime stories upheld
                    prevailing power relationships. Nor does Papke deal with the difficult but critical issue of why
                    crime writers and their audiences accepted an ideology that preserved an inequitable (and to them
                    harmful) distribution of property and power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Framing the Criminal</hi> is too much a history of ideas, pure and simple. If Papke
                    shows some important connections between the subliterature of crime and larger ideological
                    assumptions, he gives very little notion of the specific social contexts out of which this popular
                    culture arose. Were crime rates rising or falling in the particular communities that fostered the
                    new genres? What social schisms formed the backdrop to crime? Who committed which crimes? Such
                    information, culled from secondary literature, would have allowed Papke to provide a more subtle
                    analysis. Instead of a sophisticated concept of social change in the nineteenth century, shopworn
                    notions like "anomie" and "modernization" are invoked with
                    little explanation. The result is that crime appears to be little more than an idea in
                    writers' minds, with no connections to work, neighborhood, class, ethnic culture, gender,
                    or other social realities.</p>
            <p>On balance, <hi rend="i">Framing the Criminal</hi> deserves much praise for calling attention to a
                    long forgotten subliterature and for beginning to examine its ideological meanings. Papke forces
                    readers to consider the connections between how they think about crime and how they perceive the
                    larger social world. The author is much too ready, however, to abandon history for literary study;
                    the two must work together.</p>

            <p>Appearing just one hundred years after the founding of the first American settlement house in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1886, Judith Ann Trolander's history of the settlement movement is a timely
                    and much-needed study. The book begins with a deft and at some points impressively concise survey of
                    changes in neighborhood work between 1886 and 1945. This section is full of insights and
                    generalizations that will be developed by others. Trolander is not interested in going over the
                    ground covered in her earlier monograph on the 1930s, <hi rend="i">Settlement Houses and the Great
                        Depression</hi> (1975); instead, she deals with the settlements in a topical way that represents
                    a fresh approach. The most original and important part of <hi rend="i">Professionalism and Social
                        Change</hi> is its treatment of the post-1945 period. These chapters, resting almost entirely on
                    archival materials and on interviews with surviving and contemporary leaders of the movement, form
                    an original and important contribution to the history of social work. Trolander's subject
                    is change: the change from a female-dominated to a male-dominated movement after World War II, a
                    transition that she attributes to the postwar decline of feminism, and the change from stable,
                    long-term, resident settlement workers to upwardly mobile professionals with no commitment to a
                    particular neighborhood—or even to settlement work over other kinds of social work.
                    Trolander devotes one chapter to the important subject of professionalization and one to changing
                    neighborhoods. A chapter entitled "Blacks, Equal Rights, and Integration" is an
                    original and important analysis of the impact on settlements of growing black inner-city populations
                    and of the black power movement. Correctly characterizing the earlier settlement leadership as
                    racist, with a "blind spot" toward blacks (p. 94), she documents the
                    settlements' growing sympathy with the civil rights movement. The traditional settlement
                    approach was to try to serve all groups and to pursue consensus methods. This approach broke down
                    when settlements faced the more confrontational black rights movements of the 1950s; eventually, the
                    older white leadership yielded control over the settlement movement to blacks.</p>
            <p>The crucial change for settlements, Trolander believes, has been the ending of residency.
                    Traditionally, settlement houses were governed, staffed, and lived in by the well-to-do. As
                    settlements democratized, however, residency ceased, and settlement personnel became more
                    representative of the neighborhood. By the mid 1970s, for example, 50 percent of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> settlement staffs were neighborhood people. Trolander's interpretation of this
                    development raises some troubling questions. She argues that the traditional <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-085-1-086"/> settlement furthered social action because, "with influential
                    board members, middle-class staff, and poor clientele," it was "in a position to
                    bridge class lines" (p. 130). She describes the traditional settlement approach as
                    "incremental change achieved by working patiently through established channels."
                    But after World War II, when settlements yielded to criticism from the social work profession, from
                    sociologists like Herbert Gans and Richard Cloward, and from activists like Saul Alinsky and began
                    to include representatives of their neighborhoods, they ceased to function as a
                    "bridge," or as a "window on poverty" (Trolander's
                    metaphors) for influential groups. Trolander believes that this ended the settlements' role
                    in American reform. Professionalization and democratization, between them, finished off the
                    settlements.</p>
            <p>There is, however, another way of interpreting the fact that settlements were dominated by elite
                    groups and preferred consensus methods to confrontation. The problem with the analogy of
                    "bridge" to describe the social settlements is that, in suggesting a linking of
                    equal entities, it overlooks the question of where the power lies. Trolander admits that
                    "settlement houses still find themselves stigmatized as social control agencies <hi rend="i">and rightly so"</hi> (p. 240; reviewer's italics). She describes how
                    settlements struggled to improve low-income housing, to bring welfare reform, and to improve
                    services; how Community Chests and United Way organizations blocked all
                    "controversial" projects; how federal grants became "available for some
                    projects but not others"; how the more representative of their neighborhoods that
                    settlements became the more they were attacked by the social work profession. After
                    Trolander's accounts readers might well conclude that these social agencies only reflected
                    weaknesses and inequalities fundamental to the structure of American society itself. The reality of
                    power and powerlessness remains a subtext in this book; one would wish that it had been brought more
                    to the fore. Trolander has nevertheless made a significant and much-needed contribution to <placeName>

                    Clayton James, with Anne Sharp Wells. (New York: Franklin Watts, 1987. Pp. xvi, 317. Illustrations,
                    notes, bibliography, index. $19.95.)</head>
            <p>The distinguished historian D. Clayton James asks an intriguing question. Since so few of the top
                    American officers of 1941-1945 had personally commanded in battle prior to World War II, <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-085-1-087"/> how did they attain their high command? While there is a weighty body
                    of literature that catalogs the wartime achievements of these men, little attention has focused on
                    how they gained power. Culled from a list of over fifty are the eighteen James considers the most
                    significant military leaders. The distribution of services follows the strength of those services
                    during the war: seven Army generals (Marshall, MacArthur, Eisenhower, Stilwell, Clark, Bradley, and
                    Patton); five admirals (King, Leahy, Nimitz, Halsey, and Spruance); four Army Air Force generals
                    (Arnold, Spaatz, Kenney, and Eaker); and two Marine generals (Vandegrift and Smith).</p>
            <p>These were not men cut from the same cloth. Drawing primarily from biographies and autobiographies,
                    James deftly sketches how each acquired power. He explores the diversity of personality, early
                    career choices, and war experiences. While William F. "Bull" Halsey and Douglas
                    MacArthur craved publicity, Raymond A. Spruance shunned it. Some appeared unlikely candidates for
                    greatness. One would scarcely have guessed that Spruance, chronically seasick, would rank as a great
                    fleet commander. Only a handful, like MacArthur and Holland M. "Howlin'
                    Mad" Smith, experienced combat before 1941. Included among the majority who had never led
                    soldiers on a battlefield were chief of staff George C. Marshall, who fielded America's
                    largest army, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the Allied forces in Europe. In the
                    early lives of some, weaknesses were more apparent than strengths. Ernest J. King, Chester W.
                    Nimitz, and Alexander A. Vandegrift suffered courts-martial as young officers. Halsey and George C.
                    Kenney narrowly missed similar fates.</p>
            <p>The methods that were used to select men for high command appear to have been informal, inconsistent,
                    and poorly documented, yet, if judged by the commanders' longevity, they appear to have
                    been successful. While some, like Smith, Ira Eaker, and Joseph W. Stilwell, faced disappointments in
                    their professional fortunes during the final stages of World War II, only Stilwell was relieved and
                    transferred to a lower post. Many, however, left a legacy of controversial decisions for future
                    debate. Was Spruance overcautious at the Midway and Philippine Sea engagements? Should
                    "Howlin' Mad" Smith have relieved Ralph C. Smith of Duty at Saipan? How
                    mistaken was Halsey's decision to chase a decoy force of Japanese carriers in the Leyte
                    Gulf battle?</p>
            <p>The most original and best-crafted sections of James's volume appear at the beginning of the
                    chapters. Using a thematic approach, James gives an overview of the instability and turbulence of
                    the times. He traces the evolution of the structure of the high command from early adjustments to
                    coalition warfare through interservice rivalries to the final months of the Pacific War. James
                    concludes that these eighteen leaders, with their average of more than thirty years'
                    service, were the best-qualified officers available <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-085-1-088"/> at the time.
                    While chance and politics acted to shape their destinies, these human and vulnerable men were
                    authentic war heroes.</p>

               <hi rend="i">O Freedom! Afro–American Emancipation Celebrations</hi>. By William H.
                    Wiggins, Jr. (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1987. Pp. xxi, 207. Maps, illustrations,
                    table, notes, bibliography, index. $24.95.)</head>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">O Freedom!</hi> is a story of pride and of black Americans celebrating who they are,
                    what their heritage has given to them, and how they have struggled (and continue to struggle) for
                    freedom in this country. No one can read this book and believe that the Fourth of July is a holiday
                    for all Americans. For black Americans freedom celebrations take place on a variety of dates
                    according to when freedom first occurred in a particular area. For example, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Boston, and parts of the Deep South, January 1 is the day of celebration; in eastern
                    Texas, June 19; in Windsor, Ontario, August 1. Wiggins provides a rich account of how black
                    Americans have celebrated their freedom and how these freedom celebrations remain a rich part of
                    Afro-American life.</p>
            <p>Freedom celebrations have been diverse in character, but four themes are deeply held parts of the
                    Afro-American experience and frequently occur in celebrations regardless of location or
                    organization. The home, broadly defined as the family and the nuturing community, is at the heart of
                    celebrations because it provides black Americans their largest reservoir of love and support.
                    Religion is often included in celebrations both as an element of thanksgiving and as a reminder that
                    black Americans have a special relationship with God because of their suffering. Celebrations teach
                    Afro-American history so that each generation will learn about the achievements of black people and
                    also so that the young will not forget the suffering of earlier generations. Finally, celebrations
                    contain a theme of protest because emancipation was only a step toward freedom, thus, black
                    Americans continue to protest and agitate in order to achieve their freedom fully.</p>
            <p>Wiggins's study is broad both geographically and chronologically. The author covers
                    celebrations in all parts of the country and shows that slave forms of entertainment and festivities
                    have lived through emancipation celebrations. His research combines an extensive number of literary
                    sources, such as black newspapers, autobiographies, and monographs, with oral history interviews and
                    participant/observer study. The entire book is a treasure trove of material relating to
                    Afro-Americans' collective expression of joy and sorrow.</p>

            <p>The concluding chapter on the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., as a national holiday is a
                    legitimate topic for this book, but Wiggins refrains from speculating on what impact, if any, the
                    King holiday might have on emancipation celebrations in the future. Supporters of the holiday have
                    interpreted it as a black national holiday, a day to commemorate the life of King, or a day for the
                    nation to reflect on goals of equality, freedom, and justice—goals that King embodied in
                    his life and work.</p>

                    Kammen. (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1987. Pp. xv, 336. Illustrations, notes, figures,
                    index. $24.95.)</head>
            <p>Word has it that positivism (defined as the discovery of universal laws) is in retreat in the social
                    sciences. Indeed in the writing of history, explains Michael Kammen in the first and most impressive
                    essay in his new collection, positivism never served as more than an auxiliary methodology, which
                    means, of course, that few historians ever had much confidence in the capacity of history, or any of
                    the social sciences for that matter, to discover a general pattern to human behavior. This tendency
                    of historians to limit the claims for their discipline pleases Kammen. He is as wary of the
                    pretensions of Marxists and cliometricians as he is of any overreaching effort to close the process
                    of historical discovery. In light of this conviction he considers a number of broad issues. He asks
                    first, in what sense is history a way of learning and knowing and then what are the uses of history?</p>
            <p>It must be said that the answers are not ultimately consoling. We can apparently know a great deal.
                    "History is a powerful, often reliable, necessary, and distinctive way of knowing"
                    (p. 61). The caveat here ("often reliable") is not, it seems, epistemological. It
                    stems rather from the difficulties inherent in any empirical discipline that must function under the
                    impediments of incomplete information and imperfect human application. In a more general sense,
                    however, Kammen offers only "candid skepticism" (p. 62) that gives him a certain
                    satisfaction in knowing but no assurance. We can know nothing "definitively." The
                    process is what matters most not what the process may yield. Kammen may wish to eschew epistemology
                    but ultimately he cannot avoid it. He seems to be arguing that if positivism in the form of
                    universal historical laws is not defensible then the alternative is skepticism in which all
                    conclusions are provisional. A stark choice indeed, which makes one wonder why we should choose one
                    side of the theoretical dilemma <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-085-1-091"/> over the other. Should we not
                    consider even the skepticism itself provisional? And what determines Kammen's choice of one
                    historical conclusion over another if they are all equally provisional?</p>
            <p>Despite its provisionality, history does have its uses: it provides humanity with self-knowledge,
                    hence with stronger self-identity; it supplies moral knowledge for the making of informed value
                    judgments; and it establishes relationships among past, present, and future. Further, history should
                    make us more cognizant of the similarities and differences among human beings, call attention to the
                    nonrational and irrational aspects of human behavior, and illuminate the problems of causation and
                    social change. In a practical world it will make us more critical when the powerful manipulate the
                    past for partisan purposes. Finally the study of history should make humankind more discriminating
                    in weighing the significance of relationships and events. The point is not to quarrel with any of
                    these uses of history. Even if one might quibble with one or the other of them or add others that
                    seem more compelling, it remains clear that, whatever internal justification might be found for
                    history, as an intellectual discipline it is partly instrumental. Of course it does not defy logic
                    to be both a skeptic and an instrumentalist, though the two positions do tend to undermine each
                    other. History justified by its utility derives scant support from a body of knowledge that is
                    relentlessly "uncertain, contingent, inconclusive" (p. 42), and provisional.</p>
            <p>So much for theory. Fortunately Kammen has no trouble in translating metahistory into a collection of
                    informative and engaging essays. He is, apparently, a prodigious reader; hence, his essays provide a
                    brisk and compelling tour through the historiography of the last generation with side trips into
                    past epochs and other disciplines. He is touching and humane in his description of the misgivings,
                    intellectual and psychic, that have affected more than one prominent historian. He sweeps through
                    the fashions in recent history writing, passing judgments both moderate and convincing. The danger,
                    he notes, is that methodology, even a useful one, should displace history. Two historians of a
                    previous age, one neglected somewhat more than the other, Moses Coit Tyler and Johann Hui-zinga,
                    benefit from fresh evaluations. In these two essays and throughout the volume, Kammen makes use of
                    the papers of noted historians and scholars. The portraits as a consequence go much beyond the usual
                    historiographical treatment. In two other pieces, one on the idea of the life cycle and the other on
                    the <geogName>Hudson valley</geogName>, he demonstrates the importance of iconographic evidence for
                    understanding the past. Kammen has a lively and ranging mind, and even his occasional writing never
                    fails to instruct even while it entertains.</p>

                        or Union.</hi> By Jeremy Brecher. (New Haven, Conn.: Commonwork Pamphlets/Advocate Press. Pp.
                    53. Illustrations, notes, appendixes, bibliography. Paperbound, $8.00.)</head>
            <p>The past twenty years has witnessed an ever-increasing interest in studying the American past by
                    looking at what is variously described as "local history," "nearby
                    history," "ordinary people," or the "common man." Both
                    professional and nonprofessional historians have made serious attempts to uncover the facts about
                    the everyday lives of the citizenry who inhabit ground-floor America. During this period a number of
                    publications have rolled off the presses praising and advocating the "new social
                    history" that has moved historical research and writing from the ivory tower to the
                    courthouse attic. <hi rend="i">History From Below,</hi> a guide for the nonprofessional historian,
                    is yet another voice in this frontier chorus.</p>
            <p>This fifty-three-page how-to volume moves the potential researcher at a quick pace through the
                    various steps in gathering source material. Topics covered include: doing a history project,
                    gathering and using documents, oral history, collecting visual materials, and finally the
                    publication, public event, exhibit, or media presentation. Each chapter provides an ample dose of
                    well-conceived and informative suggestions and ideas on specific elements of collecting historical
                    resource material. Some 40 percent of the book deals with the topic of oral history, a time-tested
                    means of gathering historical information that has grown in popularity over the past twenty years
                    with the introduction of the modern and easy-to-use tape recorder.</p>
            <p>When suggesting topics to be pursued in the local community, Brecher—who is co-editor of
                        <hi rend="i">Brass Valley: The Story of Working People's Lives and Struggles in an
                        American Industrial Region</hi> (1982)—leans heavily on his own experiences in
                    writing about labor versus management. In <hi rend="i">History From Below</hi> he stresses topics
                    dealing with labor, unions, and minority groups; consequently, readers and potential researchers may
                    not learn of the tremendous variety of other topics needing study on the local level.
                    Brecher's emphasis, however, does not detract from the main purpose of the publication;
                    i.e., to encourage nonprofessional historians to consider the fascinating study of local history and
                    thus to learn more about themselves. <hi rend="i">History From Below</hi> is a good, basic, sound
                    introduction. Those seeking more detailed information may wish to consult two publications from the

                    $25.00. Order from the author, 11507 NE 104th, Kirkland, Washington 98033.) This is an

                    Illustrations. Paperbound, $9.00. Order from Dr. Edwin Grossnickle, 2308 Crest Drive,
                    Kalamazoo, Michigan 49008.) Edwin Grossnickle's book is an attempt to preserve his
                    family's medical heritage. The author's ancestors practiced medicine in Cass and
                    Carroll counties, Indiana, during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The author has
                    relied on his relative's recollections for some of the biographical data in the book. Since
                    very little information about his ancestors' lives has survived, however, the author
                    "has packaged facts and fiction in the interplay of ‘Three Country
                    Doctors.’" Although Grossnickle has researched the period and the history of
                    medicine for background information, the book contains a number of anachronisms. For example,
                    Grossnickle refers to a mid-nineteenth century obstetrical case in which his great-grandfather, Dr.
                    James Clement Loop, wore surgical gloves. Rubber gloves were not even manufactured until 1889 and
                    not generally employed by physicians until the turn of the century. The author also makes the
                    assumption that rural Indiana physicians immediately embraced the latest medical discoveries.
                    Because of such errors the work is of little value to the medical historian and, unfortunately,
                    lacks many of the elements of a good historical novel. <hi rend="i">Katherine Mandusic McDonell,
