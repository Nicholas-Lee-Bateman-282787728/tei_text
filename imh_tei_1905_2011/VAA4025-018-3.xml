            <p>In 1858 William T. Crawford of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lisbon</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, a graduate of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lisbon</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School, fresh from his matriculation at Mount Union college, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    county</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana, to visit relatives who had but recently
                    immigrated to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> township–on a vacation and exploring trip. He farmed a
                    crop of corn about two miles north of Hymera during the summer of that year.</p>
            <p>While thus engaged he noted the lack of education and interest in education among
                    the people with whom he came in contact. When the few schools in the
                    neighborhoods in the fall assembled, he also noted the crudity of methods
                    pursued by the teachers of these schools.</p>
            <p>The next spring at the close of the short terms of school which then prevailed,
                    he opened a select subscription school in a private residence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> in which there was a spare front room about twenty feet square. In
                    this select school there were gathered together from surrounding country schools
                    and in the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> twenty-seven young people–about equally divided between
                    males and females. This school continued for eleven weeks and adjourned to meet
                    again September 15th following. On assembling in September there were thirty-two
                    enrolled. The school awakened the people to education; and the fame of the
                    teacher spread for <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-018-3-003"/> many miles. There was at
                    the time a newspaper published at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName>, county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan county</region>
                    </placeName>, whose editor interested himself in the educational demands of
                    western Indiana. The editor visited the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> school, which visit resulted in an editorial in the newspaper,
                    recommending all teachers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan county</region>
                    </placeName>, "Before beginning their work for the school year, or if
                    any of them had already begun, to close their schools for a week, and attend the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford</region>
                    </placeName> school at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>This the teachers generally did; and then and there was held an
                    "institute week" in connection with daily recitations in this
                    select school.</p>
            <p>It was yet early enough in the fall for the most of the institute sessions to be
                    held under a spreading oak tree standing on what afterward became Ascension
                    Seminary grounds. The then acting county "school examiner"
                    attended the institute and lent it his co-operation and support.</p>
            <p>It all resulted in a popular demand for a select school which would not only
                    impart instruction, but "train teachers how to teach."</p>
            <p>In 1860, from his own purse, Mr. Crawford, then but 22 years old, purchased a
                    small field lying at the western edge of the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a "school grounds," and returned to his home
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, where he married Elizabeth Conkle, a school mate of his in Mount
                    Union college.</p>
            <p>He raised a flock of sheep and taught a three months term of school in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. He disposed of the sheep, gathered together what money he could,
                    and took his wife with him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> to build a school building and found a Normal school. Upon landing
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> he found many enthusiastic friends in support of his enterprise,
                    and he proceeded to the erection of a two-story frame building 36 by 60 feet.
                    Meantime, the Civil war had begun, and the call for volunteers to save the Union
                    had gone forth. The young professor heard the call and answered it by raising
                    Company H of the 85th Indiana infantry, and soon went to the front, where, as
                    captain of his company, he served "full three long years of
                    warfare." His command distinguished itself in many of the hard-fought
                    battles of the rebellion.</p>
            <pb n="221" id="VAA4025-018-3-004"/>
            <p>While in the service his seminary building stood weather-boarded and roofed but
                    not plastered. The army was no place for a fighting soldier to make money, and
                    money was needed to complete the building.</p>
            <p>He and his company were discharged soon after the surrender of Lee, and he came
                    home and applied himself, under limited means, to his school prospects with
                    assiduity, and so far completed the seminary building as to open school in it in
                    the fall of 1865.</p>
            <p>The post office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> was named Ascension, and this name he gave to his seminary.
                    Ascension Seminary became a worthy normal school in western Indiana, and was the
                    inspiration for the State Normal school at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Before describing this honored school, a brief description of its founder,
                    Professor William T. Crawford, may be appropriate. He was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jay county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1837; his parents, Samuel and Gracy Crawford, of
                    Scotch-Irish stock, residing in Indiana about two years. He was reared in
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Columbiana county</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, however, within six
                    miles of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lisbon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the seat of government of the county. He was the sixth of a family
                    of ten children, six of whom were teachers. He was a man of striking
                    personality, stood five feet eleven inches in his stockings. His limbs were
                    slender but well shaped and muscular. His eyes were gray, his hair a
                    tawny-black, and he had a clear complexion. An aquiline nose and a fine face
                    completes his physical description. He wore a mustache and shaved his whiskers,
                    dressed in Prince Albert coat and plug hat and looked the cultured gentleman.</p>
            <p>In action he was dynamic, and his resolution of purpose made him the
                    personification of energy. He inspired his pupils; and every teacher who
                    emanated from Ascension seminary possessed his characteristics, imitated his
                    methods and manners, and, like himself, succeeded.</p>
            <p>It is noted above that his hair was black. However, he came of an ancestry which
                    grew gray early in life, and this inheritance, together with a spell of typhoid
                    fever in the army, made his hair white, while his mustache remained black, at
                    the time he founded Ascension seminary. His picture represents him at 70 years
                    of age, taken several years after he had retired from school work.</p>
            <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-018-3-005"/>
            <p>Ascension seminary continued at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> until 1872, when, because of inadequate equipment, it was by
                    arrangement with the school trustees of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName> moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName>, occupying the second and third stories of the recently completed
                    Central school building, where it continued to 1878, when Professor Crawford
                    retired and the seminary became merged with the high school of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName>. The public schools of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName> being united under one roof with the seminary, Professor Crawford
                    conducted both.</p>
            <p>With Professor Crawford there were associated, as assistant teachers, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Farmersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Charles W. Finney, an army comrade; John T. Hays, a graduate of
                    Mount Union college, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and A. P. Allen, a graduate of Depauw (Asbury) university. At <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName> were Professor Crawford, John T. Hays, A. P. Allen, W. H. Cain and
                    Amanda DeBaun, with several grade teachers and assistants.</p>
            <p>In connection with the regular school work there was a music department, under
                    direction of Professor and Mrs. Beazle; and also a literary society where
                    expression was taught in declamation, composition and debate, with a professor
                    as critic. For expression development the school was divided into three grand
                    divisions, each of which was subdivided into three classes which came on duty
                    every three weeks successively.</p>
            <p>To economize the time for study and recitation, the literary society met every
                    Friday night of the school year. The school year had three school terms of three
                    months each. The curriculum of the school embraced everything now covered in the
                    eighth grade of the public school and went thence beyond the present high school
                    course of the public school system, taking the range of two years of the present
                    college course of study. It embraced philosophy, physiology and hygiene,
                    grammar, English, history, ancient and modern, logic and mental philosophy. In
                    mathematics it embraced integral calculus, algebra to the nth degree, geometry
                    and trigonometry.</p>
            <p>The school taught Latin, Greek and German beside the English language. There was
                    no observatory; and the students studied the stars in pairs. Professor Crawford
                    taught German and mathematics; Professors Hays and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen</region>
                    </placeName> taught Latin and English, and Professor Cain taught Greek. They <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-018-3-006"/> all taught elocution. Oratory was also a
                    specialty of the school. Professor Crawford was himself an orator.</p>
            <p>A feature of the school was mental arithmetic, which consisted in solving a
                    problem by oral analysis without the aid of the blackboard in stating and
                    solving the same.</p>
            <p>There were seven graduating classes which passed from Ascension seminary. There
                    were two thousand three hundred and seventy-eight teachers who sprang from this
                    institution, and there were many who entered the various professions and
                    avocations who did not complete the courses of study and therefore did not
                    graduate from the school. Judges, statesmen and diplomats were of this school,
                    and good citizenship abounded among them. It may well be said to be and to have
                    been an inspirational school of the normal type; and, in its day, served the
                    state and nation.</p>
            <p>The training received at Ascension seminary was practical and useful in every
                    calling. Physicians, ministers, lawyers, as well as those who followed gainful
                    avocations, who received their training in this worthy institution attest its
                    merit. It was, however, essentally a teachers' school; and its teachers
                    were everywhere and by everybody desired.</p>
            <p>Captain William T. Crawford reared a family of six children, four girls and two
                    boys. He lived out his days at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in comfort, if not in plenty, and died in 1912, and
                    throughout his career was a true patriot, a good citizen and a great
                    "Normal Educator."</p>
            <p>Captain Crawford for many years was prominent in Grand Army
                    circles–attended and addressed Grand Army reunions and campfires in

            <p>There has been much adverse criticism directed toward the direct primary system
                    in the past few years. Undoubtedly the primary has been used for a sufficiently
                    long period of years in a large majority of the states<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and
                    under widely enough varied local political conditions to allow practical and
                    theoretical students of politics to make an estimate of its actual worth. The
                    direct primary was brought forward by progressives in politics and is supported
                    by that class of political thinkers at the present time. Politicians of the old
                    school especially were opposed to its adoption, have supported it only in a
                    lukewarm manner, and now generally demand its repeal and a return to the old
                    convention system.</p>
            <p>It is necessary briefly to bring out the objections to most of the primary laws
                    of the several states. The expense to the candidates and to the state is an
                    important feature and it does not seem that any corrupt practice act yet enacted
                    has been able to eliminate this most serious objection. Again, one of the moat
                    complicated problems with which students of the primary are confronted is the
                    means by which members <list type="footnotes">

                            1914, by the Indiana Legislative Reference Bureau, in 1914, forty states
                            had some kind of a primary election law. Thirty states included
                            mandatory and state-wide features. About sixty million people, or about
                            80 per cent of the population, choose their candidates for office
                            through some sort of primary election.</item>

                    the primary of another party and naming the candidate–too often the
                    weakest man. The nonpartisan primary was offered by former Governor Hiram

                    legislature of that state and twice rejected by a referendum vote of the people,
                    or, as the Fresno <hi rend="i">Republican</hi> says: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            primaries. However, the inconsistency may not be so great, since only a

                            number voted at the actual primaries and insist on voting on a

                            convention requires a majority to nominate. At a primary a plurality
                            does the work. Geographical conditions are also to be considered. By
                            this (the convention method) opportunity is given to nominate candidates

            <p>The defenders of the primary system do not ordinarily claim that it is free from
                    imperfections, but do maintain that the members of the party should have the
                    privilege of nominating their party's candidates directly and without
                    unreasonable dictation from party leaders who can not be held legally or morally

            </p>
            <p>It is significant to note that few writers defend the primary laws of their
                    respective states in their entirety. Almost all admit imperfections and are
                    seeking reforms for their correction. Roughly, we may divide students of the
                    question into two classes, those who declare the principle of primary elections
                    inherently wrong and who demand a return to the convention system of nomination,
                    and those who maintain that the primary system is sound in principle and that
                    our efforts should be directed toward eliminating the faults and weaknesses. We
                    are not able to judge which view is preponderant, but the fact that there is
                    general dissatisfaction with the present primary laws seems to indicate that
                    some sort of reform is necessary and advisable.</p>
            <p>The practice of nominating candidates of political parties by representative
                    conventions has long been criticised. The first abandonment of the plan seems to
                    have been in 1860 in <placeName>

                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, where
                    the local political leaders agreed to the selection of candidates by popular
                    vote. The plan met with considerable favor and was tried locally in several
                    states, particularly in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Indiana primary law was enacted by the legislature of 1901 and was
                    designed for the use of local units only.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> It provided that
                    counties containing cities of more than fifty thousand inhabitants might
                    nominate county, township, and city officers by direct primary, providing that
                    the party desiring to nominate its candidates in this way had cast ten per cent
                    or more of the total vote at the preceding general election. The use of this
                    method was thus made optional and the decision rested with the precinct
                    committeemen. The management of the machinery of the primary was left with the
                    party organization and the expense was borne by the party.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Only one important change was made in the primary law by the 1921 session of the
                    legislature. Independent candidates, so-called "soreheads,"
                    are prohibited from filing as candidates for election after a primary has been
                    held. The courts have not yet handed down a decision on this law and it is Aot
                    definitely known whether this excludes all independent candidates or only those
                    who were candidates in the primary.</p>
            <p>We have seen that the primary laws in Indiana have been far from static and a
                    study of their operation is made particularly hard for this reason. However, the
                    law has not been dianged materially in the past five years and we are able to
                    discover some very striking facts. Mr. Charles Kettleboro, director of the
                    Indiana legislative reference bureau, has made a very interesting study of the
                    operation of the 1916, 1918, and 1920 primaries.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> For these
                    three years there were 1,049 offices to be filled, and candidates for 623, or
                    59%, had no opposition. In the Democratic party in 1916, 40% were unopposed, in
                    1918 60%, and in 1920 65%. In the Republican party in 1916, 46% were unopposed,
                    in 1918 62%, and in 1920 56%. As Mr. Kettleboro points out, we may safely accept
                    as the basis of our study that where a candidate has no opposition he is either
                    brought out by the machine or is favored by it. If this were not the case the
                    party leaders would bring some one out in opposition to him. Thus we see from
                    the above figures that the majority of the ticket in most cases is probably not
                    named by the people in the operation of the primary, but by the party leaders. I
                    do not mean to say that this opportunity is abused by them, or that incompetent
                    or vicious candidates are always thrust upon the people by these <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In this state the precinct committeemen are the basis of the organization of
                    political parties. They elect the county chairmen, who in turn elect the
                    district chairmen. The thirteen district chairmen compose the state central
                    committee and elect the state chairman. It is obvious that a control of the
                    precinct committeemen will eventually lead to a control of the entire political
                    machinery of the state. We have the following figures for <placeName>

            <p>The writer had hoped to be able to present figures from all of the counties in
                    the state and discover how far this same condition prevailed in local politics.
                    Due to errors in the records, incomplete records, and the failure to get
                    information from the clerks of the circuit courts, only the following incomplete
                    table could be compiled, yet we can discover from it the same general tendencies
                    in most of the counties.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

               <item>
                  <hi rend="sup">28</hi> This fact is also borne out by a little incident
                        that was called to my attention. The authenticity of it cannot be vouched
                        for, yet I will present It for what it is worth, as it comes from a reliable
                        source. Thirty minutes before the balloting began in the Republican state
                        convention, in May, 1920, a newspaper reporter walked thru the assembled
                        delegates in Tomlinson Hall, <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                        </placeName> and asked many of them who was going to be nominated for a
                        certain state office. Invariably the reply was: "I don't
                        know; the 'dope' hasn't come down yet."
                        We may well believe from this that to some degree at least the people did
                        not nominate the state ticket, thru their properly elected delegates, but
                        that the work was really done by some one higher up, who handed down the
                        "dope."</item>

                        </placeName> was obtained from Dr. Frederic H. Guild, Instructor in

                        always affect the contests for nomination. The insufficiency of these
                        figures is realized, and yet it is hoped that they may indicate the general
                        tendency.</item>

            <p>As was seen, the per cent of local offices uncontested was 70.9, and that of
                    state offices 59. In nine of these local primaries 90% of the candidates were
                    unopposed, in seventeen 75% were unopposed, in twenty-seven over 50% were
                    unopposed, and in only nine were there contests for all offices. These figures
                    seem to indicate that there is the same tendency in local offices as in the
                    state offices. In many instances, as was suggested, the leaders of the party
                    name the ticket.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Thus we have practically the Hughes plan

            <p>It is unfortunate that the Indiana law provides that the primary election records
                    for local offices need only be kept for six months. Not only is this likely to
                    lead to irregularities, but it is almost impossible as a result to collect such
                    information for Indiana as we have from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. There should be a change in our law requiring that these records
                    be kept permanently.</p>
            <p>Thus we find that we are spending a total of $606,490.93 in these counties for
                    which the records are complete for the years 1916 and 1918 for the nomination of
                    candidates of whom about seventy per cent for local offices are unopposed, and
                    fifty-six per cent for state offices. Of course, there is the provision in the
                    state laws that where there is no opposition there is no primary held, but there
                    is usually some opposition and the total expense of the primary must be borne
                    for the nomination of these few candidates where there is opposition. In the
                    majority of these instances it appears to be not a question <list type="footnotes">

                    office and the public would be served equally well by either candidate. Indeed,
                    many times it is a struggle between two local leaders for control of the party
                    organization and the candidacy for these local offices is merely expresesive of
                    that struggle. Yet we spend thousands of dollars in these contests and for
                    ratifying the choice of unopposed candidates. We may well ask ourselves how
                    important these elections are to good government in the community and to the
                    proper conduct of public business.</p>
            <p>Another serious defect in our primary law referred to at the beginning of this
                    article is the inability of one party to keep the members of another party from
                    coming into the primary and helping to nominate its candidates.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> One of the most flagrant examples of this was in the recent city
                    primary of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where Samuel Lewis Shank was nominated as the Republican candidate
                    for mayor. Political experts of the city estimate that fully twenty thousand
                    Democrats voted in the Republican primary and that almost all of these votes
                    went to Mr. Shank, as it was rather generally admitted that he would be the
                    weakest candidate and the least desirable to the Republican organization.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> No satisfactory plan has as yet been devised in Indiana
                    whereby we may insure that such abuses of primary legislation will not occur.</p>
            <p>In considering this question of primary reform we have one very decided handicap
                    always with us which we must recognize. Former Governor James P. Goodrich of
                    Indiana stated it as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is very difficult to frame any sort of legislation that can control
                            the election that will be automatic in its application and will make up
                            for the appalling neglect of the average citizen to give any time to
                                politics.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The percentage of qualified voters who cast their ballots in the 1916, 1918 and
                    1920 primaries well illustrates this lack of interest. In the Democratic party
                    in 1916, 50% voted, in 1918 47%, and in 1920 32%. In the Republican party in
                    1916 62% voted, in 1918 46%, and in 1920 67%.</p>

            <p>Henry Hollowell squatted on the site of Marengo, or Big Springs, in 1811. Later
                    Stewart bought him out and built his home there. Soon Malachi Monk moved into
                    the county and with the assistance of the other men built the old block house
                    about 1812. There were many Indians prowling around then, but one finds no
                    record of any conflict between the whites and the red men. The block house,
                    which was two stories high, was built of logs. The upper story projected out
                    beyond the lower story so that the settlers could fire down on the Indians and
                    give them a reception that they would remember awhile. The old building was torn
                    down about the time of the Civil war.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> One may see the
                    foundations of it near the home of J. E. Ross, on the Marengo and Milltown pike,
                    about one mile east of Marengo. David Stewart bought the farm from the
                    government in April, 1833. Mr. Stewart, who was a minister, was in much demand
                    then. He assisted the two Kinkaid brothers to establish the first Christian
                    church in the county. This church was formally organized in October, 1819, in
                    the little log house of the Mr. Kinkaid over on Dog creek near the present town
                    of English. At first there were thirteen members.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    on the body of a sugar tree which stood in the yard before Stewart's
                    cabin. Many years later an academy was built near the site of the cabin. The
                    sugar tree still stood there till about 1880, when it fell down."</p>
            <p>Marengo became a noted place during the Civil war. The settlers were Union
                    through and through. They allowed no one to wear a butternut badge into the
                    town. One day a man named David Miller came into the town armed with two
                    revolvers and a long-barrel rifle. He had on the butternut badge which the loyal
                    people of the town hated so much. He came for trouble and found what he was
                    after. As he walked down the street of the little town several men saw the
                    badge. He went into Stewart's gun shop and was standing there when Ben
                    Goodman and W. J. Stewart walked into the shop. Goodman had been wounded in the
                    battle of <geogName>Stone's river</geogName> and was at home now on a
                    furlough. Stewart jerked the badge off of Miller's breast and Ben
                    Goodman hit him over the head with a pair of knucks before had had a chance to
                    shoot or even draw his gun. Before the fight was over Miller was almost killed.
                    He managed with the help of some of the citizens to get home some way. When
                    Hines came through Marengo Miller hoped to get revenge. He went to Hines and
                    wanted to give him information which would have been very injurious to the
                    Union, but Captain Hines looked on him with suspicion. One of the rebels stepped
                    up to him and took his gun and drew back to knock his brains out but Hines
                    interfered and prevented the man from hitting him. Then the rebel looked at him
                    for a few minutes and said, "You say that you are for the South. Why in
                    the h– don't you <hi rend="i">go</hi> south and fight for

                    very large. Probably there never was over three hundred people in the town at
                    its greatest size. During the Civil war the little town made a good record and
                    furnished so many men that the draft never was needed there.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>The first man who bought land in the vicinity of English was Moses Smith, who
                    bought the east half of the northwest quarter of section 24, township 2 south,
                    range 1 west. Here there were three forks of Little Blue: namely, Camp fork, Dog
                    creek, and Brownstown fork. Later other settlers came and a town was built. W.
                    W. Cummins made the first plat of the town in 1839. It was recorded at <placeName>

                    incorporated in 1886 the name was changed to English in honor of William H.
                    English who was elected to congress from that district in 1850, and was <placeName>

            <p>Milltown which for a long time was called Leavenworth's Mill was platted
                    about 1837 by Seth M. Leavenworth. In that year Manual Schoonover secured a
                    license to sell foreign goods in the town of Milltown.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>The plat of the town as submitted in the text was extended by other citizens. The
                    town grew rapidly and by the Civil war was one of the important towns of the
                    county. A plat of the town is given here. On the old plat made by Leavenworth
                    there are two still houses shown.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>Magnolia was located about four miles northwest of Leavenworth on the Hartford
                    road. Addison Williams bought the southwest quarter of section 14, township 3
                    south, range 1 east, on February 19,1820. He tried to plat a town called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Haven</settlement>
                    </placeName> but the town never grew. So he filed the plat of Magnolia with the
                    county recorder on the fourth day of July, 1838. Magnolia soon had a still
                    house, a store, and a blacksmith shop. The buhrstones of the old mill may still
                    be seen in the outer part of the town. By the time of the Civil war the town had
                    grown to have a population of about 100 people.</p>

                    Julius Woodford, John L. Smtih, and Zebulum Leavenworth were appointed

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The pike which was to be any width not exceeding forty feet must
                    be well built and the streams over which the road ran must be well bridged. The
                    course of the road was to be laid off in sections and the construction let out
                    to the lowest bidder, who had to furnish a bond for the faithful performance of
                    his duty. It was required that the road be completed in five years, after which
                    toll gates might be built and fees charged. The fees for riding were: six and
                    one-fourth cents for persons, eighteen and three-fourths cents for carts, twelve
                    and one-half cents for empty carts, fifty cents for loaded wagons, six and
                    one-fourth cents for twenty head of sheep, hogs or cattle.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                    The money with which to build this road might be raised by selling stock to the
                    citizens of the county. There are many more provisions of this law, but they are

            <p>Most of the roads were entitled to use the three per cent. funds in their
                    construction. Julius Woodford was appointed to receive the money derived from
                    this fund and pay out the same at the bidding of the county commissioners. At

                    was free from trees in the whole county. The first settlers chose the uplands
                    for their homes because the lowlands lacked good drainage and were not
                    healthful. <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-018-3-030"/> Sometimes the settlers bought the land from
                    the national government before they settled on the land but the great majority
                    settled the land first and later bought it from the government. The price paid
                    the government was $1.25 per acre. The first hard piece of work for the pioneer
                    was to build a cabin. The logs were plentiful out of which almost all were
                    built. The ground was cleared from trees as fast as the pioneer could manage it.
                    A little garden was planted and a field of corn was cultivated. The early
                    pioneer took his grist many miles to mill where the corn was ground into a
                    coarse meal. A few of the squatters pounded up their corn and made meal out of
                    it in that way. The potato patch was the most important after the corn field. As
                    soon as the man was able he set out a small orchard on the farm.</p>
            <p>The early pioneer did not need many things. The woods were full of game and the
                    rivers full of fish. Hence they used wild meat and fish for food. Probably salt
                    was the most difficult of all these foodstuffs to get. There were a few salt
                    springs in the county over in the northwest part, but that region was not
                    settled for a long time. After 1825 the stores at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName> furnished the settlers salt. By that time there was a large river
                    trade and much salt was landed at these ports. Before that time the pioneer went
                    to the salt licks a few of which were Royce's and Rock's in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>, French Lick in <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName>. Here he boiled the water down and made him a sack of salt and then
                    rode home on horseback. A few rode to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to buy a sack of salt and came home the next day. Salt was very
                    high in these days. Seth Leavenworth in 1827 tried to get the tax taken off of
                    salt, but the General Assembly refused to pass the bill.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>The settlers made their own sugar and sirup from the maple trees of which there

            <p>The potatoes which the people grew were much different from the ones grown
                    nowadays. The leading varieties were pink, peach blow, white peach blow, Prince
                    Albert, early Goodrich, Shaker russet, Mishanoes and the coal boat. In the
                    virgin soil the potatoes grew to be very large. When they were cooked and
                    prepared for eating one could hardly swallow them, they were so strong. They
                    were not comparable with the early <placeName>

            <p>The farmer did his plowing with a jumping shovel, which had one long share.
                    Nothing was more aggravating than such a plow. If the share caught behind a
                    strong root the plow would either jerk a man severely or jump out of the ground
                    and hit him in the ribs with the handles. Neither <list type="footnotes">

                    was plowing. The grain was cut with a sickle or a cradle. Much later in the
                    county a reaper was used.</p>
            <p>By 1850 the settlers had cleared away much of the timber and probably half of the
                    land was under cultivation. The land was very suitable for fruit growing. Many
                    farmers had large orchards in which many varieties of apples grew. The leading
                    ones were summer queen, pearmain, maiden blush, rambo, russet, fall pippin,
                    belle flower, Hall's seedling, horse apple, <placeName>

                    </placeName> greening, jannet, Smith's cider, Carolina red, winesap,
                    limbertwig, and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> pippin. Many farmers had a great variety of these apples. The
                    reports of the state fairs held in Indiana showed that men often received prizes
                    for the best exhibit of twenty-five different kinds of apples, and fifteen
                    different kinds of pears.</p>
            <p>Certain years the farmers did not plant much corn. They would climb the beech and
                    the oak trees in the early spring and see if the trees would have a crop of the
                    mast or beechnuts and acorns. At that time of the year there was a little flower
                    on the trees if they were to grow fruit that year. In case of the fruit being
                    grown on the trees then there was no need for much corn. The mast would fatten
                    the hogs well and the meat was thought to be better.</p>
            <p>By 1818 the Indians had gone but the woods were full of wild animals of all
                    kinds, the most dangerous of which were the panther, the bear, the wolf and the
                    wild cat. Of course these animals did not attack man often but they were a great
                    bother in carrying away the young pigs and other stock of the farmer.</p>
            <p>Peter Peckinpaugh who owned a large farm in the southern part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> township kept several wolf hounds in these early days. One night
                    about 9 o'clock he heard the hogs making a noise down at the pen where
                    he had a few young pigs. He let the dogs out of the kennel and ran down to the
                    pen with a handspike in his hands of which he always kept one near the house.
                    Before he arrived the dogs had caught some animal and were engaged in a terrible
                    fight. It seemed that two of the big dogs had caught the varmit by the neck and
                    the other one had it by the hips in which condition they were just circling
                    around on the ground. <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-018-3-033"/> Watching his chance
                    he hit down between them and broke its back. The dogs soon killed the animal
                    then. When day came they found that the animal was a large panther that measured
                    about eight feet in length.</p>
            <p>The county commissioners, in compliance with the state law, offered a bounty of
                    one dollar for each wolf scalp the farmers would bring in. John Stone, James
                    Land, Nathan Ruth, Dan Farley, Enos Campbell, and Edmund Ardach were allowed $1
                    each for wolf scalps in November, 1827.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aside from these dangerous animals the woods were full of rabbits, squirrels, and
                    many other smaller animals. Hence the country was a hunter's paradise
                    which enabled him to live on wild meat most all the time.</p>

                    blue cat, the yellow, the pike, sunfish, bass, and various other kinds. Men
                    spent much time in fishing every spring and summer.</p>
            <p>The main wealth of the county was in its timber, of which there was a great
                    amount and for which there was a ready market. Many men were engaged in
                    coopering the rough barrels which were filled with apples and lime while the
                    tight barrels were filled with molasses or apple brandy. The amount of brandy
                    made in the county was very large. Most of it was shipped south to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> where there was a ready market for that product. The timber was
                    sawn and shipped out in almost all forms. At one time acres of ground at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> were covered with the lumber. When the rise in the river came then
                    the big steamboats would load on the freight and steam away with the lumber. The
                    large boats were the Bostonia, Belle Key, Shotwell, Memphis, and the Eclipse.
                    The Eclipse and the Shotwell were floating palaces and can not be described
                    well. Many large staves (pipe for wine barrels) were made and sold in the south
                    out of which the men made tobacco hogsheads or sugar hogsheads.</p>
            <p>Another great export was lime. Many kilns were made and burned and the product
                    loaded on the boats and shipped south <list type="footnotes">

                    The barges were loaded with apples, lime, hay, corn, and many other products.
                    The lime was generally put on a flat boat so that the barrels were protected
                    from the rain in foul weather. When the barges were loaded one good boat could
                    tow several barges.</p>
            <p>In 1830 Daniel Lyons began the business of making skiffs for sale. Re made a good
                    grade of skiffs which were sold to men on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>.
                    Before long these skiffs were known from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the Gulf of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>. As far as known no one ever complained about the skiffs. When he
                    died the work of the skiff factory was carried on by his sons, S. P. Lyons and
                    W. A. Lyons. These men used the same good material and judgment in the selection
                    and shaping the boats that their father had used and if any thing the boys put
                    out a better grade of boats than their father had. About 1885 Norton Whitcomb
                    bought out S. P. Lyons' share of the factory and is now one of the
                    managers. At present the old shop has about three men employed in the factory
                    and still turn out the high grade of boats whose reputation has been so high and
                    so well deserved.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The flat boat trade was very important during the early days of the
                    county's history. The boats were about the size of barges and were
                    covered to protect the crew from the winds and the cargo from the rain and the
                    snow. On the top of the boat and at each end was a steering oar by which the
                    boat was guided. Guiding the boat and rowing it to the shore was very hard work.
                    There were about five men on the boat besides the cook. When the boat was loaded
                    and ready to start the men guided it out into the river and let it drift gently
                    down. Stops were made at most towns and the produce on the boat was sold and
                    other cargoes taken on the boat too. By the time the boat arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> the cargo was sold and the boat was sold or the owner had some

                    built cheaper than paying for the towing of the old one back, it was generally
                    left.</p>
            <p>Life on the flat boat was very pleasant in beautiful weather, but woe betide the
                    crew of the boat when it was caught out on the swift <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> or on the broad <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> when a storm arose. Two men were put at each oar and the boat was
                    rowed ashore by the big steering oars. Then the boat was tied up till fair
                    weather came. The writer has heard old boatmen tell that they were so tired and
                    their arms were so sore that they could not comb their hair after rowing the
                    boat ashore in such a storm. Sometimes it took a day or more to get to shore if
                    the wind set wrong. During the early history of the county the flat boat trade
                    was very large. The boats carried away very much produce and gave an outlet for
                    the products of the county the chief of which were lime, whiskey, corn, smoked
                    meat, and various products from the forests.</p>
            <p>Meat packing was one of the chief industries of the county. The hogs which ran
                    out to the commons generally took care of themselves. Often they would stand on
                    their hind feet and eat the bark off of the slippery elms as high as they could
                    reach. For that reason they were called "elm peelers." When
                    the mast was ripe the hogs grew fat in the fall and were ready for butchering.
                    They were driven to the banks of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> and there
                    men were hired to help butcher the hogs and smoke the meat. When the meat was
                    ready for shipment it was placed on the flat boat or on the steamboat and
                    shipped south to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where there was a ready market for all the county could ship
                    there.</p>
            <p>The farmer's stock ran out to the commons till about 1887. After that
                    date the stock was kept up in the farmer's own pasture. If the stock
                    was caught out the road supervisor was empowered to empound such stock till the
                    owner paid the fine and the damage if there was any.</p>
            <p>When the stock was running out men had much trouble to keep their stock
                    distinguished from their neighbor's. Many resorted to the ear mark.

            <p>The still house was another leading industrial establishment. Apples grew in the
                    county by thousands of bushels and were made into apple brandy which was shipped
                    away very easily. Many old traces of the still houses can still be seen in the
                    county.</p>
            <p>One ugly feature of the whole flat boat trade was the danger of robbers. Of a
                    night in many places watches were kept on the boat to keep off the robbers who
                    did not hesitate to kill if it was necessary to get the cargo. The following
                    article was taken from the <placeName>

                    were murdered on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> near Troy (<placeName>

                    sunk in five feet water had been deserted for many hours. It was a large boat
                    about 95 feet long and loaded with flour, whiskey, and groceries. The boat was
                    named Eliza No. 2. The boat which presented a ghastly sight was marked with
                    blood from one end to the other. The bodies of two of the dead men were found in
                    the boat and the third body was found in the water. The one in the water had
                    weights fastened to it. The men evidently were killed with a hatchett for one
                    was found near which was covered with blood. Their skulls had been crushed in by
                    the severe strokes of the hatchet, and there were various wounds of many kinds
                    found on their bodies. From the appearance many believe that the crew might have
                    mutinied part killing the rest and then robbing the boat of what they could get

                    as early as 1827.</p>
            <p>These mills were run by water power or by horse power. A dam was built across the
                    stream and the water was used to furnish the power. The first mill driven by
                    steam was located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName> about 1830. The two <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName> cousins did the managing of the mill there. Much later Carnes, Lake
                    and Benham built mills all of which did excellent work.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These mills did grinding on certain days of each week. On these days the pioneers
                    came with their grist of corn. The first come was the first served. While the
                    men were waiting for their grist they generally indulged in wrestling or other
                    amusements. When the writer's father was a little boy he went with some
                    men to one of these old mills. The weather was very inclement and the men were
                    in the shelter waiting their turn telling ghost stories. They could not see
                    where the meal was coming out from where they were. Suddenly they heard two
                    hounds which belonged to one of the men barking every now and then. Soon the men
                    went out to see what was the matter and found the two dogs up in the box where
                    the meal came out. They ate the meal about as fast as it came out and then were
                    barking for more. After that one of the men stayed by the meal when the wolf
                    hounds were present with the owners.</p>
            <p>While the men were waiting for their grists they told ghost stories and commented
                    on the wonderful feat of prowess each one had committed once upon a time. The
                    men who did not get their grinding till after dark and had to ride home through
                    the dark while their fancies were active thought that they saw ghosts of all
                    sorts. These old settlers were very superstitious and believed in spirits of all
                    sorts. They saw signs in the heavens and wonders in the earth beneath. They
                    would not begin a job of work on Friday. If they saw the moon through brush that
                    was a bad sign. The potatoes must be planted when the sign was right. Yet in the
                    good old days the men had their joys and were happy, I presume, as they are in
                    our modern times.</p>

                    </placeName>, in September, 1838, covers one of the darkest pages in the history
                    of our state and has no parallel in the annals of American history. The farther
                    in time. We get away from this event the plainer will this appear and the more
                    interest will be attached to the route which is consecrated by the blood of that
                    helpless people at the hands of a civilized and christian state. Much of this
                    route in this state is a public highway, which I name "The
                    Pottawattomie Trail."</p>
            <p>The Pottawattomie Indians originally occupied the territory north of the
                        <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. Their conversion to the Christian religion through the Catholic
                    faith dated back to 1680. When they did become converted they were nearly as
                    firm and devout as were the primitive Christians. When the priests would leave
                    them, they would teach each other and tried hard to preserve the religious
                    influence they had previously enjoyed. Until Bishop Brute was appointed for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1834, they were only visited by priests from that place and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At this time they numbered four thousand souls.</p>
            <p>One of the first cares of the bishop was to visit this mission which was the only
                    one in northern Indiana, and make provision for their spiritual welfare. He
                    caused to be erected a two-story hewn-log chapel on the north side of the lake.
                    Near this spot stands a monument, erected to their memory through the efforts of
                    Daniel McDonald.</p>
            <p>Rev. M. Desseils of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> was put in charge of this mission and the results were wonderful.
                    The impulse given by the bishop was such that their reverence for the black <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-018-3-039"/> gowns which their fathers had transmitted
                    to them, that they vowed if the great spirit would send them another person to
                    minister to their spiritual welfare, they would listen to his instructions and
                    they came by hundreds to demand them and ask for baptism.</p>
            <p>Rev. Desseils baptized a quarter of those who had previously been heathens and
                    soon after that he died. The work to which he had been exposed brought on a
                    spell of sickness that left him almost at the point of death, but feeling that
                    his last moments were fast approaching, he aroused himself and met his faithful
                    children at the altar and while attending them with his dying hands, the last
                    duties enjoined on him by his Master, expired on its very steps. Those who had
                    watched him with much anxiety, and unwilling to believe that their master was
                    dead, and hoping he was only sleeping, remained in prayer by his corpse for four
                    days when another clergyman arrived to perform the funeral rites over his body.</p>
            <p>Rev. Desseils' successor was Benjamin Petit, a young Frenchman, who had
                    left his native land and the profession of law to devote his life as a priest.
                    He did not know their language, but the ardor of his zeal helped him soon to
                    learn it. Wondering at his kindness and pleasant manner, they said he Was not a
                    black gown from a foreign land, but a redskin like themselves.</p>
            <p>Previous to this time, President Jackson, after being importuned to extinguish
                    the title to the lands held by the Indians in northern Indiana, appointed as
                    commissioners, Governor Jonathan Jennings, John W. Davis and Mark Crume. A large
                    number of prominent Indians were present, among them being Wa-She-Anas,
                    Wa-Ban-She, Aub-Bee-Naubee and others, and also Captain Bouri. This conference
                    was held at Chippewa, on the banks of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>
                    </placeName>, north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on October twenty-sixth, 1832, the twentieth treaty.</p>
            <p>Governor Jennings, as usual, had imbibed too freely and his conduct so disgusted
                    the Indians that it came near disrupting the whole conference. After a stormy
                    session of several days, the treaty was concluded and by its terms all the land
                    held by them in northern Indiana was ceded to the government, except certain
                    allotments around Twin Lakes and north of them. This treaty included one of
                    their largest <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-018-3-040"/> villages and a Catholic
                    mission on the banks of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The President did not ratify this treaty until 1836. Meanwhile the trappers,
                    squatters, land sharks and all rushed in, which was in direct violation of the
                    policy of the government, as the President had called the attention of Congress
                    to information in similar cases.</p>
            <p>At this conference the government had forbidden any intoxicating liquor being
                    brought on the grounds. When "Jack Douglas" brought some fine
                    wine and brandies, it, of course, was confiscated and put in the council chamber
                    of one of the commissioners for safe keeping and ready to use as the occasion
                    might require. This proved to be one of the essentials in making this treaty.
                    The terms of this treaty were obtained through persuasion, liquor, bribery,
                    threats and intimidation, and perhaps that is why its ratification was held up
                    for four years. Were a set of men to appeal to our federal court today to
                    confirm their title to a piece of real estate obtained by such methods as did
                    these commissioners employ, the court would dismiss the case, give the
                    appellants a severe reprimand and order their arrest before they got out of the
                    city.</p>
            <p>The terms of this treaty were not what was desired by the land sharks, and their
                    next move was to have Colonel Abel Pepper, the Indian agent, who was stationed
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, buy these allotments, but after several attempts he failed.</p>
            <p>The next move was to have the state legislature memorialize the federal
                    government to extinguish the title to these lands. Consequently President
                    Jackson appointed John T. Douglas (perhaps the "Jack Douglas"
                    that took part in the conference of 1832), as commissioner, and the Indians were
                    represented by Chee-Chan-Chosee-As-Kum, Wee-Saw-Muk-Koxie, Quin-Quit-To-On.
                    Historians disagree as to the time and place of this treaty. Thomas B. Helms, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a very reliable historian, says it was made in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, D. C, February 11, 1837, and was ratified within one week from its
                    conclusion, all of which appears very plausible and is also confirmed by
                    Menomine in his speech.</p>
            <p>This treaty was a ratification of all former treaties and it was further
                    stipulated that they would move at the end of <pb n="258" id="VAA4025-018-3-041"/> two years to lands provided for them by the government, along the
                        <geogName>Osage river</geogName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, the expense of the removal and one year's subsistence was
                    to be met by the government. By the terms of the treaty of 1832, Menomine and
                    his tribe, which numbered about 1,500 Indians, were allotted about twenty
                    sections of land around Twin Lakes and extended to within a mile of Plymouth.
                    Their principal village covered nearly two sections north of the lakes and
                    consisted of one hundred wigwams or huts. They raised corn and vegetables as a
                    part means of subsistence. They were peaceable and friendly to the whites who
                    would often attend their church.</p>
            <p>Father Benjamin Petit had charge of the mission, as has been previously stated,
                    and they would come for miles, form large congregations, and were very devout in
                    their mode of worship. Some of them had received an English education and were
                    in a fair way to be assimilated into a loyal citizenship. But this was not to be
                    and as soon as this supposed treaty was made known, they were harassed by land
                    sharks or their agents, squatters and trappers.</p>
            <p>Colonel Abel Pepper was also nagging at them to move, and at a council at Pretty
                    Lake, he threatened to remove them by force. When all had had their say,
                    Menomine arose, his white head towering above all others, with the dignity of
                    Daniel Webster and just as defiant, said in substance: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The President does not know the truth. He, like me, has been deceived. He

                            lands and still refuse. He would not by force drive me from my home, the
                            graves of my tribe and children, who have gone to the Great Spirit, nor
                            to allow you to tell me that your braves will take me, tied like a dog,
                            if he knew the truth. My brother, the President is just, but he listens
                            to his young chiefs, who have lied. When he knows the truth, he will
                            leave me to my own. I have not sold my lands. I will not sell them; I
                            have not signed any treaty, and I shall not sign any. I am not going to
                            leave my land. I do not want to hear anything more about it.</p>

            <p>And amid the applause of his chiefs, he sat down. This speech, delivered in the
                    peculiar style of the Indian orator presented one of those very rare occasions
                    of which <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-018-3-042"/> history gives few instances, and
                    would have made a profound impression on any one except those who could see
                    nothing but those broad acres of fine land.</p>
            <p>Andrew Jackson was President when this supposed treaty was made. He stated that
                    it was the policy of the government to deal fairly with the Indians, pay them
                    for their lands, obtain their consent for possession and removal, and whenever
                    possible teach them the arts of civilization, that in time they would assimilate
                    and become loyal citizens. He had previously called on congress for an
                    investigation of cases that had come to his knowledge of where the whites had
                    infringed on the lands of the redmen, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>That it was the duty of the federal government to extinguish the title to lands
                    held by the Indians, and when it did that, the matter rested with the state, and
                    the Indians could leave or stay, but were amenable to the laws of the state; and
                    any further interference on the part of the federal government would be an
                    infringement on the rights of the state and was dangerous.</p>
            <p>Now to charge my country and your country, a Christian nation, with being guilty
                    of making this attack on Christianity and civilization is wrong, not sustained
                    by facts and is an unjust accusation. As to Colonel Abel Pepper, he was a man in
                    form, a fiend, a pliable tool in the hands of Gov. David R. Wallace, father of
                    Gen. Lew Wallace, and those who coveted these lands.</p>
            <p>During the summer of 1838, preparations were made to remove the Indians by force.
                    The Indians were aware of this and had resolved to fight, when, through the
                    counsel of Father Petit, and on his promise to accompany them to their new home,
                    they promised him if the worst did come, they would submit peacefully. This
                    averted a general massacre.</p>
            <p>The Catholic church had labored with these people for over one hundred and fifty
                    years, ofttimes at the cost of the lives of her priests. She had seen her
                    missions swept aside one by one until only this one remained. True to her trust,
                    she stood by these people and used her influence to stay the hand of execution,
                    but all in vain, all the time counseling them to avoid shedding blood.</p>
            <pb n="260" id="VAA4025-018-3-043"/>
            <p>The work of destruction began in August, 1838, when a body of men entered their
                    village, took possession of their crops, and lands, which was resisted by the
                    Indians driving them out and tearing down their shanties. The crisis came when
                    the cabin of Mr. Waters was torn down by the Indians, and then he and others in
                    return burned some of their huts. A courier was sent to notify their agent,
                    Colonel Pepper, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was sent on to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to notify the Governor. Gov. Wallace authorized Gen. John Tipton to
                    raise an army and proceed to Twin Lakes and remove them. This removal had been
                    planned to take place later in the fall. This army was made up of troops from
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>, <settlement type="city">South

               </placeName> and Laporte.</p>
            <p>Col. Pepper invited all the tribe to a council to be held at the village on
                    August 29. Not knowing that they were being decoyed, many of them assembled and
                    at the time Mr. Pepper was pretending to hold a council, Gen. Tipton appeared
                    with his army, which were secreted, surrounded the village and made all, between
                    three and four hundred, prisoners. He then proceeded to the church where they
                    were engaged in worship and made his presence known by firing guns and
                    surrounding the church and made all within prisoners. This is the first and only
                    time a religious meeting was broken up and the worshipers made prisoners like a
                    lot of law violators by the order of the governor of our state, whose sworn duty
                    it was to protect them. They pled for mercy and to be let alone, but all to no
                    effect as General Tipton was a military man and knew to obey orders. When
                    evening came and they did not return home others were sent out in search of them
                    and they too were made prisoners. All of these were held under guard while other
                    troops were scouring the reservation for others and destroying their homes. They
                    also rounded up about four hundred ponies that were to be used in their journey.</p>
            <p>Many tragic scenes were enacted in this round-up. Some fought like demons till
                    they were overpowered and roped; some went in hiding, others sought shelter in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. In one case where they had surrounded the hut and called on the
                    Indian to surrender, he sprang for his tomahawk and rifle and when he saw the
                    cross, which the priest wore, <pb n="261" id="VAA4025-018-3-044"/> he threw down
                    his weapons, crossed his arms and held them out to be tied. This work was kept
                    up until they had gathered near fifteen hundred and had placed 859 names on
                    roll. Father Petit was permitted to assemble them for a final service. He says:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>At the moment of my departure I assembled all my children to speak to
                            them for the last time. I wept and they sobbed aloud. It was a sorrowful
                            sight and over this, our dying mission, we prayed for the success of
                            those missions that they would establish in their new home to which they
                            were being driven.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>On the Sunday before their departure, they were visited by many whites who came
                    to bid them farewell. No doubt there were some in that assemblage whose
                    consciences were not at rest. On the last day they were permitted, under guard,
                    to visit the graves of their departed friends, and held an impressive service,
                    heart-rending scenes that were indescribable were witnessed. General Tipton went
                    prepared with sixty wagons and hired teams of horses and oxen. In the meantime
                    these were being loaded with their goods, such as would be needed, the old,
                    sick, of which there were over one hundred, the women and children.</p>
            <p>On September 4, 1838, they were lined up, some afoot, some on ponies, followed by
                    the wagons, and all heavily guarded with a lot of guards at the rear with
                    bayonets, which were often used to keep the weak ones in the procession. Before
                    starting the torch was applied to their village, so that they might see their
                    homes destroyed and they would not want to return. When all was in readiness,
                    this grewsome procession, nearly three miles long, like a funeral procession,
                    which in reality it was, started on its final journey. It was a very sickly
                    season. The sun was hot and the road was dry and dusty. They drove down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> road to Chippewa, on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they camped the night of the fourth. Here more was added to
                    their cup of sorrow. They wished to take their dead with them and when this was
                    denied, they had to leave them at the roadside or camping ground, hence every
                    camping ground was a burial ground.</p>
            <p>In making preparations for this expedition it was thought a picnic and many
                    volunteers were turned away, but at the <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-018-3-045"/> end
                    of the first day, twenty of the troops, heartsick, stole twenty of the
                    Indians' ponies and deserted the command.</p>
            <p>September 5 they moved down to Mud creek, which is the name applied to the upper
                    course of Big Indian creek, where they camped. There was much suffering for
                    water, as many of the streams were dry, and food, as but little preparation had
                    been made for this. September 6 they reached Logans-port and camped on Honey
                    creek for three days and nights. The physicians of the city came out and
                    rendered what aid they could to the sick. While here two adults and several
                    children died, and were buried just north of the Vandalia railroad. These people
                    were human beings and the love of parent for their offspring was strong. Then
                    think what must have been their grief in taking up their march, and the anxiety
                    of the father at the close of the day to learn of the condition of his family.</p>
            <p>September 10 they started on their march down <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> avenue to <geogName>Eel river</geogName>, then down the north side
                    of the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, through Georgetown and forded Crooked
                    creek near the mouth; thence on to the county line, then followed the bank of
                    the river to a creek. On the west side of this creek was old Winamac's
                    village and is about eleven miles below Logans-port. They reached this point at
                    5 p. m., and camped there. I name this Menominee's camping ground on
                    September 10, 1838.</p>
            <p>September 11, at 10:00 a. m., they took up their march. Here the road left the
                    river and followed the foot of the bluff to the Jacob Mullendore farm. From here
                    they followed the top of the bluff to Little Burnett's creek, then at
                    the foot of the bluff through Lockport. On the hillside north of the road is a
                    spring, which was much larger then than it is now. Here some of the Indians were
                    permitted to drink. This spring I name the Pottawattomie spring. From here they
                    followed the foot of the bluff to the line between the Schneip and Kirkpat-rick
                    farms to the river, thence west to Rattle Snake. They forded the creek, ascended
                    the <geogName>Gilliam hill</geogName>, where there was a camping ground for
                    tribes that had preceded this one; thence on a line through Conner's
                    reserve to Pleasant Run creek, where they went into camp, after traveling all
                    day in the hot sun, enveloped in a cloud of dust. Cruelty unspeakable! Outrage
                        <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-018-3-046"/> infinite! For such were the scenes
                    witnessed that night in the grove along the creek whose waters went rippling
                    along to swell the mighty deep. With their condition growing worse every day,
                    one cannot help but wonder if their faith in the God of mercy, whom they had
                    learned to worship, will hold out. May the great Ruler of nations never again
                    permit Indiana to be disgraced by such scenes as were witnessed in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Carroll county</region>
                    </placeName> those two days and nights while passing through it, should be the
                    prayer of every liberty loving citizen.</p>
            <p>September 12 they took up their line of march by following the road up the hill,
                    crossed the range line to the creek and followed it to Pittsburg. The Delphi <hi rend="i">Oracle</hi> of September 15, 1838, edited by Henry B. Milroy, said:

                    camped near here the night of the twelfth. It was here that General Tipton
                    distributed $5,000 worth of goods to allay the discontent and revive their
                    spirits. This only proved temporary.</p>
            <p>September 13 they traveled seventeen miles and reached <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lagrange</region>
                    </placeName> where they camped. Heat and dust getting worse, teams worn out,
                    many of the troops sick and unable to proceed, Dr. Richie and son, attending
                    physicians, nearly out of medicine, one hundred and sixty sick Indians, large
                    numbers had to be left to their fate along the road and the children dying at
                    the rate of three to five per day, the faith that had carried them thus far was
                    being shaken and the Indian spirit of freedom or death was showing itself. It
                    was at this time Colonel Pepper and General Tipton began to come to their
                    senses. General Tipton sent an urgent message back to Father Petit to hasten to
                    his aid, and by permission of Bishop Brute, he started.</p>
            <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-018-3-047"/>
            <p>September 14 they reached Williamsport where they camped and on Sunday, September
                    16, near Perrysville, Father Petit came up to them. He says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I came in sight of my poor christian children marching in a line, guarded
                            by soldiers, who hastened their steps, a burning hot sun cast its rays
                            down upon them. After them came the wagons, into which were crowded the
                            women, children, the sick and dying. Almost all the babies were dead or
                            dying. I baptized several newly born babes, whose first step was from
                            exile to heaven.</p>

            </p>
            <p>At Danville on September 18, the command was handed over to Judge William Polk,
                    who was appointed by the government to receive them. After resting two days they
                    took up their line of march, leaving six graves under the shadow of the cross.</p>
            <p>Their hardships only increased as they moved along over the parched prairie, no
                    water and the nights growing cooler. After near two months' journey,
                    the remnant of the tribe reached the <geogName>Osage river</geogName> with a
                    loss of one-fifth of its original number, besides the great number of children.
                    Father Petit was so worn out, that he could not return at once as directed by
                    the Bishop, but as soon as he was able he started on his return and reached <placeName>

            <p>In conclusion, if the reader, in his imagination, will go with me where the trail

                            half suppressed sobs escaped from the motley group as they passed along,
                            some on foot, some on ponies and others in wagons, all driven, like <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-018-3-048"/> cattle to the shambles, to a

                            spirits of their departed heroes, who were looking down from the clouds,
                            or from the Great Spirit who would ultimately redress the wrongs of the

            <p>Dear reader, in fancy, I stood there at midnight, the moon shone in all its
                    splendor with nothing to break the stillness of the night save the occasional
                    hooting of an owl, when I heard the hoofs of a horse as he came galloping down
                    the <geogName>Gilliam hill</geogName>. I heard him as he splashed through the
                    creek, and as he passed by, I saw he carried a messenger, but it was not Paul
                    Revere. The next day at 10:00 a. m., looking to the east I saw a cloud of dust,
                    then came galloping down the road a horse and rider, and as he drew near, I saw
                    that it was not Phil Sheridan, but Father Petit, hastening on to comfort his
                    people and to counsel them to humbly submit to the will of David Wallace, the
                    governor of the Christian state of Indiana.</p>

                    learn of the injustice meted out to the weak by the strong and greedy, if you

            <p>The year 1856 marked the advent of the Know Nothings into national politics, for
                    their first and only presidential campaign. Circumstances seemed favorable for
                    the success of a new party. The Democratic administration had given universal
                    dissatisfaction to the north. A revival of the Whig party was conceded to be
                    hopeless. The Republican party was not yet organized on a national basis, but it
                    was already beginning to overshadow the American movement in the north. Which
                    one of the two would survive to contest future elections with the Democracy
                    depended largely on the issue of the campaign of 1856.</p>
            <p>The Grand Council was to meet at <placeName>

                    </placeName> February 18, 1856. As this body did not have the power to nominate
                    candidates, President Bartlett of the Grand Council issued a call for a national
                    convention to be held at the same place four days later. Each state delegation
                    was to consist of one delegate from each congressional district and two from the
                    state at large.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> As a matter of fact the same
                    representatives were to compose both council and convention.</p>
            <p>Since the Indiana delegation at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> had acquiesced in the move for a reunion with the Grand Council,
                    preparations were made to send representatives to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> session. The "twelfth section" issue however was
                    not allowed to go unnoticed. If not expunged it would prevent a union of the
                    anti-slavery forces and make certain the election of a Democrat. Another view
                    was that it introduced the question of slavery where nothing should have been
                    said on the subject.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> For either the former or the latter

                    for a revision of the laws on suffrage; none but Americans in spirit and in

            <p>The platform and nominee did please one political faction. A remnant of the old
                    Whigs still existed, faithful to Whiggery and unidentified with the other
                    movements of the time although they had long ceased to maintain an organization
                    in Indiana. A portion of these now stood for the same principles as the
                    Americans. They regarded the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The main question before the Americans in the early part of 1856 was whether or
                    not they would co-operate with the Republicans in the state campaign. Because of
                    their own weakness and the increased strength of the latter, it was practically
                    certain that they could not direct a fusion movement to their own ends as in
                    1854. The efficiency of the Know Nothing secret machinery was gone. Many of the
                    lodges had disbanded and many of those who supported Fillmore were not willing
                    to sacrifice their anti-slavery opinions to their Americanism. Yet they claimed
                    to muster fifty thousand votes in the state, a number with which they could do
                    nothing themselves, but without which the Republicans could not hope for
                        victory.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> It was plainly seen that united there was a
                    chance to carry the state; if the Americans put their own ticket in the field,
                    defeat was certain. On the other hand the party might lose its identiy by fusing
                    with a stronger movement. Also any union with the Republicans would be certain
                    to incur the displeasure of the southern wing of the party.</p>
            <p>The first step toward a fusion was taken by a convention of editors of the
                    People's party at <placeName>

                    present. The convention endorsed the People's platforms of 1854 and
                    1855 and recommended the calling of a nominating convention the following

                            present corrupt national administration, and as a party we stand ready
                            to cooperate with any party which aims to put an end to its misrule. And
                            further: we regard the repeal of the <placeName>

                            nation. The same should be restored, and if efforts to that end fail,
                            Congress should refuse, under all circumstances, to admit any State into
                            the Union tolerating slavery, made free by that compromise. Therefore we
                            approve of the call for a People's convention to be held on the
                            first day of May next, and earnestly call, upon the American party
                            throughout the State to send a full delegation to that convention.</p>

            <p>The order of President Sheets was regarded in some quarters as an attempt to sell
                    out the Americans to the "abolitionist" Republican party, but
                    the general temper of the former was favorable to a fusion and full delegations

            <p>The harmony that nominally existed between the Republicans and the Americans was
                    broken when David Kilgore, a former Know Nothing, introduced a resolution that
                    the convention should nominate delegates to attend the Republican national
                    convention, the following June. On behalf of the Americans, R. N. Hudson, of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Express,</hi> protested, saying that as the convention was not
                    exclusively Republican, it could not nominate delegates. But loud cries of
                    "Yes, it is," drowned out his voice and he sat down. Kilgore
                    replied that he was an older and a better American than Hudson, but that
                    Americanism could be postponed while the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

                    which would "tread upon the toes of the Know Nothings." A <placeName>

                    </placeName> Know Nothing spoke against Kilgore's resolution, but it
                    was of no avail.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The incident showed the relative weakness
                    of the Americans. The conditions of 1854 were reversed –the Americans
                    were the tools of Republicans instead of vice versa. It showed that the Union
                    between the two rested on a very slight foundation.</p>

                    wish to add abolitionism to Know Nothingism." This gave color to the

                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>

                    </placeName> a council of the entire party was said to have been called upon the
                    eve of the election and there it was decided to cast their vote solidly for the
                    Old Liners.<hi rend="sup">102</hi> Such were the charges made by the Republicans
                    over the entire state against their allies. They found one grain of consolation
                    however. If the Americans had gone in a body for Willard, that vote would be
                    drawn off for their own candidate in the November election, and Fremont, if such
                    were the case, would be certain of carrying Indiana.<hi rend="sup">103</hi>
                    Therein may lie the explanation of the charges. The Republicans made great
                    political capital out of them for the next month and on them based their hope of
                    success.</p>
            <p>The Americans of course were indignant. They claimed to have kept their promises
                    and to have supported the ticket in spite of the treatment received at the last
                    Fusion convention. At any rate, a comparison of the vote with that in the coming
                    November election would show where the American vote had gone.<hi rend="sup">104</hi>

                            then made to the Old Liners and accepted. The Americans then voted the

                            were doubtful in their support of the American candidate. The former was

                    states, the Republicans the north, and the Americans the border states. If those
                    circumstances came to pass the election would be thrown into the house of
                    representatives. It was regarded as certain that neither Fremont nor Buchanan,
                    as sectional candidates, could command the support of the house. Fillmore then
                    would be the logical compromise candidate whom both sections could support.<hi rend="sup">111</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An attempt, based upon such calculations, was made to withdraw the Fillmore
                    ticket in Indiana. On October 29, J. R. Thompson, a Fillmore man of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName>, brought letters from Mr. Jewett, of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> state council, and from the president of the American national
                    council to Colonel R. W. Thompson of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He called on Major A. H. Davidson, of the Indiana state central
                    committee, and presented the letters. It was the desire of Fillmore and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> Americans to give Indiana to Fremont, which would increase
                    Fillmore's chances of throwing the election into the house of
                    representatives. Major Davidson said it could be done by the concurrence of the
                    American state central committee, and advised Mr. Thompson to see Colonel R. W.
                    Thompson on the subject. He did so, but the latter declined to withdraw the
                    ticket on the ground that it was too late to do so and swing the Fillmore vote
                    to Fremont.<hi rend="sup">112</hi> Rumors spread that the ticket had been
                    withdrawn. The state central committee met November 3, and issued a statement,
                    signed by A. H. Davidson, William G. Armstrong, and Milton Gregg, which denied
                    the rumors to that effect, or that there had been any fusion with either of the
                    other parties, and called on the Americans to stand firm in support of their

            <p>The position assumed by the central committee in this statement was almost
                    identical with that of the Republicans. It represented the attitude of Milton
                    Gregg and others of his stamp on the committee, but it certainly did not reflect
                    the opinions of the South Americans of the "Pocket." The
                    purpose of the circular is not stated, but the time of its appearance and its
                    character would suggest that it was intended for the consumption of the voters

            <p>The results of the election disproved the assertion that the Americans had not
                    supported Morton in October. Buchanan received but 691 votes more than Willard.
                    Morton received 17,763 votes more than Fremont. The Fillmore vote of 22,386 had
                    evidently been subtracted from the strength of Morton, not of Willard. In twenty
                    counties of southern Indiana<hi rend="sup">119</hi> the Willard and Buchanan
                    strength remained practically the same, 25,761 and 26,528. Morton received
                    18,536 votes in the same counties, which was approximately the sum of the number
                    polled by Fillmore, 13,229, and Fremont, 6,038. A study of the figures in some
                    counties gives even more interesting results. In <placeName>

                    campaign led to the loss of the state for Fremont. The <placeName>

                    party performed a service by defeating a sectional party in the state. Many
                    supporters of Fillmore in Indiana believed the same thing.<hi rend="sup">120</hi> From the radical wing of the Republicans came the statement that if
                    they had not shown so much deference to Know Nothingism and had made a bold
                    fight in southern Indiana instead of abandoning it to Fillmore, the state would
                    have been saved for Fremont.<hi rend="sup">121</hi> But Buchanan received a
                    majority over <hi rend="b">both</hi> candidates of 1,910. The question arises
                    also that even if the American ticket had been withdrawn according to the scheme
                    referred to above, would the pure Americans of the river counties and the
                    "Pocket" have voted for the "abolitionist,"
                    Fremont? It is not probable.</p>

                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> and the moderate Americans generally laid the
                    responsibility for the loss of the second great battle of the People upon the

            </p>
            <p>The American party as a factor in national politics ended with this campaign, its
                    first and last. Fillmore received a large vote, but carried the single state of <placeName>

                    </placeName> with its eight electoral votes. For some time it remained a factor
                    in Indiana state politics, but with ever decreasing importance. American
                    sentiment lingered in the southern portion of the state until, in the face of
                    the question of union or disunion, it disappeared.</p>

            <p>There remains the task of tracing the fortunes of the remnant of the American
                    party which still persisted in southern Indiana, nominally at least a factor in
                    local politics. It was recognized that their importance as a power in politics
                    was gone, and evidence of the fact was not lacking.</p>
            <p>The American Union club, as the Fillmore club of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was called, announced that it would support Thomas E. Holbrook for
                    mayor, and John D. Perrine for clerk, at the city election, which was to be held
                    November 22, 1856. The former declined to run, but Perrine received 73 votes.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In practically the same territory Fillmore had received
                    152 votes, which showed a falling off of over half from his strength.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The Americans supported the Republican candidate for
                    mayor, who was successful. This was the only time the Americans ever contested a
                    city election in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Americans in the state legislature acted and voted generally with the
                    Republicans, but in some instances with the Democrats.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    Although but few in number, their support was essential to the Republicans. This
                    was especially true in the Senate, where the Americans and the Anti-Lecompton
                    Democrats held the balance of power. In the election of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senators the Fillmore men in the house cast two votes for George G.
                    Dunn and Richard W. Thompson. In the senate the Americans acted with the
                    Republicans by refusing to go into a joint session. The result was the election
                    of two Democratic senators, Graham N. Fitch and Jesse D. Bright, although there
                    was no quorum present.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Know Nothingism had fallen into disrepute in central and northern Indiana by
                    1858. The term became one of opprobrium and to prove that a candidate was a
                    "Know Nothing of 1854" would hurt his chances for election.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Know Nothings in 1858 were looked upon with somewhat the same disfavor as
                    were the Harford convention Federalists in 1830.</p>
            <p>The American party of <placeName>

                    </placeName> held a meeting March 29, 1858, to determine which of the two state
                    tickets they should support.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Under the influence of R. W.
                    Thompson and William K. Edwards they took a conservative, national stand and did
                    not commit themselves to the support of either state ticket. An American state
                    convention to be held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, July 2, was suggested, but as there was little enthusiasm in the
                    American cause no notice was taken of the proposal.</p>
            <p>In other parts of the state the desire to defeat the Lecompton Democrats made the
                    Americans more favorable toward fusion. In <placeName>

                        candidates.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> In other counties, such as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and Lawrence, the opposition put both Americans and Republicans
                    upon a joint ticket.</p>
            <p>Further testimony of the more liberal spirit pervading Americanism is furnished
                    by the fact that the Seymour <hi rend="i">Times</hi> recommended the support of
                    the opposition state ticket, even though there were some citizens of foreign
                    birth or descent upon it.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the same spirit the <placeName>

                    because he was of German blood.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>The Democrats who had joined the Know Nothing councils in 1854 had generally gone
                    back to their own party. W. M. Ray, the Lecompton candidate for congress in the
                    Sixth district, had been a Know Nothing.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>Throughout the year 1859 the Americans were maneuvering for a recognition which
                    the Republicans were unwilling to concede. While sympathizing with the aims of
                    the latter party, they stood aloof and watched the progress of events. The
                    Americans would continue to pursue a policy of masterly inactivity because the
                    Republicans were too sectional. Yet harmonious action was necessary because the
                    latter could not succeed without American aid. If the Republican party would
                    pursue a more liberal policy and plant itself upon a platform upon which all the
                    elements of the opposition could stand, the Americans gave assurance of hearty
                    co-operation. Such a combination would be necessary to carry Indiana and the few
                    other doubtful states which were necessary for success.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

                    American support in Indiana, but met with little success.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
                    R. W. Thompson was opposed to any such union on the ground that it would swallow
                    up Americanism.</p>
            <p>The Americans in many portions of the state came out for "Lincoln.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> The <placeName>

            <p>At the state election, which came in October, the Americans supported the
                    Opposition ticket almost unanimously, as the vote of the various counties shows.
                    Taking those counties where the Americans had polled a large vote in 1856, the
                    result in 1860 shows that Lane received a vote approximately equal to that of
                    both Fremont and Fillmore, while <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hendricks</region>
                    </placeName> received practically the same as Willard. The greater portion of
                    Lane's vote in southern Indiana must have come from former
                        Americans.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Constitutional Union party polled but 5,306 votes in the entire state,
                    practically all of which came from the American districts. This party's
                    strength in 1860 was in each county about twenty-five per cent of the American
                    strength in 1856. This leads to but one conclusion–the Constitutional
                    Unionists were practically all former Americans and about one-fourth of the
                    Fillmore vote went to Bell and Everett.</p>

                    Fremont vote in southern Indiana. Three-fourths of the Fillmore men must have
                    voted for him. The old Know Nothings of 1854 were becoming Republicans in 1860.
                    The figures for the election show this conclusively. While the combined vote of
                    Douglas and Breckenridge varied little from that of Buchanan, the Lincoln and
                    Bell vote equaled that of Fremont and Fillmore, but the proportions were
                        reversed.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most of the Know Nothings of 1854, as we have seen, sooner or later found their
                    way into the Republican party. Those with the most pronounced anti-slavery views
                    had followed Orth, Colfax, and Cumback, in the first secession, which came after
                    the introduction of the third degree and the adoption of the "twelfth
                    section" platform in 1855. The long alliance with the Republicans in
                    the Fusion movements, 1854-60, made the step easier after the defeat of
                    Fillmore. Those who still remained too conservative went to the Republicans by
                    the way of the Constitutional Union party. Among the last were many of the
                    leaders, including R. W. Thompson, who became active and prominent as a
                    Republican.</p>
            <p>Thus the Know Nothing party passed quietly out of existence. Its career had been
                    as stormy as it had been brief. But the Know Nothings were not to blame, for
                    they must be judged by the standards of the time. They engaged in riots, but
                    this was the period of Civil war in <placeName>

                    than in those years, 1854-60. They hated their opponents and were as cordially
                    hated in return.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to justify their principles. But as it is still <list type="footnotes">

                    the fear of "pauper foreigners," can we wonder that in those
                    trying times our countrymen became alarmed? There are still believers in great
                    conspiracies.</p>
            <p>The most repellant feature of the organization was its secret political method.
                    Such methods are certainly incompatible with Democratic ideals. They can be
                    justified only in the case of a downtrodden people struggling for their rights.</p>
            <p>The Know Nothing order left but a slight impress upon our politics or
                    institutions. It served as a demonstration that any attempt at ecclesiastical
                    control would be successfully resisted. In the same way it was a protest against
                    immigrants who refuse to become Americanized–by no means a dead issue
                    in this day of the "hyphenated" American. The Know Nothing
                    movement served as a convenient means to bridge over the gap made by the
                    disappearance of the Whig party until the time was ripe for the appearance of
                    the Republican party. The long association with the latter party, and the fact
                    that most of the northern Know Nothings later joined it, was a great factor in
                    determining the policy of that party with respect to the period of
                    naturalization.</p>
            <p>In conclusion we may say that the sincerity of the men who joined the order of
                    the Star-Spangled Banner can not be questioned. They believed that they were
                    combatting great dangers which threatened our freedom and they made use of the
                    means which seemed most likely to insure success.</p>

                    Clark, he settled down in a log cabin which stood on the banks of the

                    to the western terminus of the road. A company of light infantry followed by
                    Revolutionary soldiers, and a committee of citizens formed the parade. Also

                    year's growth of the county since its organization in 1822. Under the
                    direction of Miles S. Cox, chairman of the executive committee, considerable
                    preliminary work had been carried on along educational lines through the schools
                    of the county, clubs, civic and fraternal organizations, acquainting the
                    citizens of the county with the developments that had occurred during the last
                    century. The centennial exercises extended over two days, and an historical
                    parade, addresses and a pageant were the main fatures of the celebration. A
                    large collection of historical relics was brought together in Rushville for this
                    occasion. Not only were the store windows filled with valuable historical
                    relics, but a newly constructed garage was turned over to the committee and in
                    this spacious building relics and exhibits of rare value were on display. A

                    the celebration. The "spirit of 1776", followed by the
                    soldiers <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-018-3-093"/> of various wars, led the parade.

                    was also serving as president of the Indiana Nature Study club at the time of
                    his death. Perhaps the movement that was most near to Dr. Wynn's heart
                    at the time of his death was the Indiana Lincoln Memorial association, of which
                    he was the founder. Only a few weeks before he left on his mountain climbing
                    trip he had been responsible for the organization of the Lincoln association,
                    the primary object of which is to erect a fitting memorial somewhere in Indiana,
                    dedicated to the youth of Lincoln spent upon Indiana soil. Dr. Wynn was the
                    first president of this organization.</p>
            <p>In his death Indiana suffers an irreparable loss. Student and scholar, a
                    scientific investigator, a humanitarian, a leader in all patriotic and
                    historical movements, a devoted student of Lincoln, and a lover of the great
                    outdoors, his character will always stand for the best type of Indiana
                manhood.</p>
