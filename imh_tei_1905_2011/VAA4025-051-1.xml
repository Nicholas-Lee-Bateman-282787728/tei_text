            <p>The files of any historical magazine will reveal much of its own history, but not everything. There
                    will be some hidden and some partially hidden facts pertaining to the never-ending search for copy,
                    to the supervision of printing, the labor of editing, keeping tab to some extent on subscribers and
                    readers, and, of course, there will be the effort to see that deadlines are met, if possible, by all
                    concerned, editors, writers, printers, and many others.</p>
            <p>Strange to say, none of the historical magazines of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, of which there are so many today, are very old. The <hi rend="i">American Historical
                        Review</hi> was established by the then young American Historical Association as late as October
                    of 1894. There were a few state historical magazines that were founded earlier, but not many, and
                    some of them were not able to keep going steadily. The publication known as the <hi rend="i">Annals
                        of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>

                    </placeName> in 1863, but it was not published continuously during the next forty years. The first
                    series came to an end in 1874. Asecond series was begun in the 1880's under the same name,
                    but had a short life. This series was not under the auspices of the state historical society. The
                    third series of the <hi rend="i">Annals of lowa</hi> has been published by the Iowa State Department
                    of History and Archives since 1893 and still lives. The <hi rend="i">

                                William O. Lynch to write the history of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> during these
                                years.</p>
                            <p>William O. Lynch comes to mind at once as the best-qualified person to undertake such a

                                president of the Indiana Historical Society from 1947 to 1949, and professor of history
                                at Indiana University from 1920 until his retirement in 1941, he is uniquely qualified
                                for the task. His personal memories of editing the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> reach back
                                farther than do those of anyone else. A native of Indiana, Professor Emeritus Lynch now

                    including, the March issue of 1913, was the <hi rend="i">Indiana Quarterly Magazine of History</hi>.
                    This was the official title until the appearance of the June number of 1913. In the period from 1905
                    to June, 1913, however, the shorter title was used freely and often, and, since this was true, and
                    because the term "Quarterly" was dropped from the name of the publication after
                    the issue of March, 1913, it will not be used again in this historical account.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    He finally gave serious consideration to the project, but took time to examine the various problems
                    involved. The recent attempt in 1897 of William H. Smith, who had earlier written a <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi>, to establish the <hi rend="i">Indianian</hi>, a magazine designed to
                    furnish historical material for teachers, the public schools, and for general readers, naturally
                    interested Cottman. He pondered the fact that even this popular publication could not receive enough
                    support from paying subscribers to live very long, which required anyone to be cautious in trying to
                    establish a journal that would appeal to serious students and writers of history.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since Cottman was himself a job-printer and a writer of historical articles for newspapers, the
                    question kept returning to his mind: Why could he not serve as editor and manager of a magazine of
                    history and look after the printing? While considering this question, he could not avoid doing some
                    dreaming. He reveals that his thoughts were colored by the idea that such a magazine as he was
                    contemplating "would not only edify all who partook of its quarterly doses," but
                    would "perpetuate the memory" of himself. He knew that tombstones were resorted to
                    for such perpetuation, but not much reading matter could be carried by such a marker and few would
                    read that little. On the contrary, a history magazine would go into the archives and much material
                    preserved by it would grow better with age, and would be sought for by history students in the
                    future. Such researchers could not avoid seeing the editor's name on the title pages and on
                    other pages where it might chance to be printed. After learning <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi> Publication of the <hi rend="i">Indianian</hi> (<placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                            </placeName>, 1897-1901), which was designed for school officials, teachers, and pupils in
                            the higher grades, was planned by William H. Smith. He and the "associated
                            editors" formed a company of shareholders. The venture did not pay and the holders
                            of the shares eventually lost what they had invested. Seemingly, Smith, the chief promoter,
                            broke with his co-partners before the demise of the <hi rend="i">Indianian</hi>. The aim of
                            the magazine, stated on the title page, was "To teach patriotism, enhance state
                            pride, and encourage a deeper love of country." The effort was kept up from
                            January, 1898, to February, 1901. Though first planned to be a semi-weekly, after two issues
                            it became a monthly. Each year two volumes were published, and it ran to six regular
                            volumes, which were issued during 1898, 1899, and 1900. An extra volume of two issues,
                            January and February, 1901, was published as a double number. No more followed, but this
                            double number is known as volume VII. The <hi rend="i">Indianian</hi> was designed for
                            readers of certain classes as stated and for general readers, but the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                                Magazine of Historu</hi> was, comparatively, a much more highly specialized publication.
                            It was in no sense a successor to the <hi rend="i">Indianian</hi>, though Cottman studied
                            the causes of the latter's failure with care.</item>

                    <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-051-1-014"/> about such dreaming, no one can keep from feeling acquainted with
                    the man who was the founder of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of Hictory</hi>.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While trying to learn what to do to get a magazine started, Cottman conferred with the able head of
                    the Indiana State Library, William E. Henry, from whom came the first practical suggestion, and it
                    bore fruit. Henry was not only friendly to the would-be editor, but offered personal aid, saying
                    that if a list of subscribers should be worked up, he would use his influence to get his
                    acquaintances to take the magazine at one dollar per year. Contacting possible subscribers meant
                    work, but it indicated something tangible at last.</p>
            <p>Cottman at once prepared a brief "Prospectus" which was handed to each person who
                    was approached as a possible subscriber, and, in addition, copies were sent to many newspaper
                    editors as well as to other selected persons. Relative to the nature of the proposed magazine the
                    "Prospectus" included this passage: "The publication will be strictly
                    what it purports to be at the start—a magazine devoted to the preservation of matter that
                    is of real value to the historical student. There will be no space given to advertising
                    ‘write ups’ and no cheap padding. Of matter within its legitimate field, there
                    is an abundance, and outside this field, it will make no bid for popular favor."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of the editors who received the brief "Prospectus" seemed to approve the
                    declaration of principles and wrote very favorably in regard to the proposed venture. A modest
                    number of subscribers was obtained (about 300 by 1906), and members of the very small Indiana
                    Historical Society became interested. Hilton U. Brown, manager of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi>, offered to produce in half-tones or zinc etchings such illustrations as

            <p>While seeking subscribers, Cottman was busy gathering and preparing copy for the first issue. He
                    plainly stated that his purpose was to experiment for at least one year. If the trial proved to be a
                    disappointment, the project could be abandoned. It was hoped that the income from subscriptions
                    would pay for the printing, but the money came in so slowly that the editor was obliged to run off
                    the first issue on his own press. He performed the labor himself, with some help from his wife.
                    Remaining numbers of 1905 were farmed out to other printers. Beginning with the March number of
                    1906, all issues from that one to and including that of March, 1913, were published by Edward J.
                    Heckler of <placeName>

            <p>The March issue of 1905 looks very well today, even to persons who have had considerable experience
                    as editors of historical magazines. When Editor Cottman had completed the initial issue of the
                    journal, he desired to speak frankly to all who were interested in the undertaking and so he
                    prepared a statement headed "A Word From the Factotum."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> This
                    "facetious effusion," as he called it in later years, was inserted at the end of
                    the first issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, "but afterward eliminated from all but a
                    very few copies" at the insistence of Mrs. Cottman. She felt that "such levity was
                    not dignified" and her husband gave way to her judgment. It was in the December issue of
                    1929, when the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> had come to the end of its twenty-fifth year, that the
                    "effusion" was published in full and went to all subscribers. At this distance,
                    one is inclined to feel that the good wife of the keen but worried editor should not have interfered
                    with his excellent judgment. No doubt the contents of the issue as originally printed were seen by
                    several persons interested in the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, but the effect would have been better

                            concerning the life of the man whom he had known well, in which he said that Cottman
                            designed the cover of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> that was used until 1913. In this
                            attempt to describe the cover's decorative border, Coleman called it "both

            <p>In the extra message that was deleted, Editor Cottman gave an account of how he had printed the
                    initial number on his own press. He mentioned some of his difficulties in the following passage:
                    "To pump off something more than thirty thousand impressions on a foot-power job press,
                    applying ink with a hand-brayer; to edit in the midst of mechanical perplexities; to make up copy,
                    while standing at the case in order to spare the time necessary for writing it—these
                    things are not conducive to perfect results."</p>
            <p>Then after expressing a hope that friends would rally to support him in his efforts to establish the
                    magazine, he declared he would be glad to pay another printer and devote his time "to heavy
                    editing and to the seeking out of matter than can be secured only by time and labor." He
                    then concluded the appeal in these words: "If this seems worth while to you help us along
                    with the ever-potent dollar [by subscribing for the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> at one dollar per
                    year], with an encouraging word and by bringing our magazine to the attention of some one else who
                    may be interested. Your cooperation is all important, and it is for you to determine whether the
                    publication can last beyond the first year and become a permanent success. Having this success very

            </p>
            <p>Building up adequate support for the new <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> proved to be a slow process, but
                    not so tardy as the growth of the Indiana Historical Society. During the first three years of the
                        <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, the connection between it and the Society was not vital. The <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> relied on subscribers and the few Society members paid annual dues.
                    Writing about the Indiana Historical Society in the March, 1907, issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, Editor Cottman said: "This Society has the prestige that comes with age. It
                    has existed now more than seventy-five years, and in the course of that time there have been
                    identified with it, particularly in its earlier years, a goodly portion of the men whose names are
                    honored in the history of the state." From time to time, papers of historical value had
                    been read before the Society. In later years this custom had been largely abandoned, and the Society
                    was mainly known for its <hi rend="i">Publications</hi>. In all, three volumes of the <list type="footnotes">

                    been published by 1907. "By way of permanent endowment," the Society had in that
                    year the interest on $3,000, most of which was donated by William H. English. With few
                    members, the annual dues from them amounted to little. Appeals to the legislature had not brought
                    any response. The Society had experienced several lapses, sometimes extending over years. The
                    semi-annual public meetings of the Society and the presentation of papers at such meetings were
                    features of the past. The Society now (during the early years of the new century) held "one
                    brief business meeting each year which few hear of and fewer attend."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the reasons why it was difficult to found the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>,
                    therefore, was that there was no real state historical society. It would be natural to suppose that
                    the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> was born because of the Society, but the truth is that Editor Cottman
                    not only created the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> but through it, as his agency, he stimulated the
                    Society to take on some vigor. Since 1907, and especially since 1912, the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi> and the Indiana Historical Society have cooperated in the matter of
                    finances and in many other ways. In the issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> for March, 1913, the
                    last number published before the transfer to Indiana University, two items relative to the finances
                    of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> appear in the editor's report of the annual meeting
                    (1912) of the Indiana Historical Society. The annual dues of Society members were raised from one to
                    two dollars, and a sum not to exceed $100.00 was voted to cover any deficit that might
                    occur in regard to publishing the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> for the year 1913. Since 1907, the
                    Society had guaranteed the cost of publishing the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> to an amount not
                    exceeding $150.00 each year. Having increased the membership dues to $2.00 per
                    year, each member was to receive the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> free, in the future, and the Society
                    was to turn half of the fees over to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> each year.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                            an editorial which probably did more to put some life into the Indiana Historical Society
                            than did any advice received by that organization to that time. The tone of the editorial

                    the number of members could be greatly increased. Aboard of editors was soon formed, and, in the
                    issue of June, 1913, a member of the board stressed the obvious truth, that the total number of
                    subscribers, including, of course, the members of the state historical society, ought to be
                    "considerably increased." Indeed, there ought to be at least 1,000 subscribers, it

                    historical society, the goal for that association soon became 1,000 members. In time, this
                    membership was reached and passed, but a good many years were required.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To return to the early question as to whether the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> should be discontinued
                    at the end of 1905, Cottman wrote briefly and eloquently concerning the settling of that problem in
                    December, 1929: "At the end of the first year there was plenty of excuse for relegating the
                    Indiana Magazine of History to the limbo of dead things, but having nursed the infant thus long, I
                    hated to be a quitter and forsake it; so I attended to its wants another year, and yet
                        another."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> At the end of 1907, after serving as editor and manager
                    without compensation for three years, Cottman had to give up the difficult task because he had
                    become involved in plans that required him to migrate to the Puget Sound area. During the year 1907,
                    however, the Indiana Historical Society had authorized Cottman to spend not to exceed
                    $150.00 "to insure the continued publication of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>
                    if necessary." This was surely a boost at the right juncture. It not only helped at the

                            have checked the matter carefully. During the first period as editor, Cottman brought out
                            the first twelve issues, serving exactly three years, 1905-1907. During his second, briefer
                            period as editor, he took over in time to bring out the December, 1911, issue, thus reducing
                            Coleman's period as editor to three and three-fourths years. Cottman continued
                            through the year 1912, and in addition brought out the March, 1913, issue. Thus he served,
                            in all, four and one-half years.</item>

                    new arrangement was adopted, and it aided in keeping the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> going. It also
                    aided in obtaining an editor to succeed Cottman at the end of the year 1907.</p>
            <p>The new editor who was persuaded to take over was Christopher B. Coleman, a young man who was
                    employed in the department of history of Butler College, then located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Since history was his line of work, Coleman was able to give some time to the editing
                    of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, which otherwise might have perished
                    prematurely. He performed well the duties pertaining to the editorship of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and continued in the work until the fall of 1911. At that time, he wished to do
                    graduate work in his field at Columbia University, which made it necessary to give up his editorial
                    duties. It happened that Cottman remained in the Pacific Northwest only a bit longer than two years,
                    and was again working and living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> by mid-summer of 1910. He kept up an interest in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi>. During his first year away, he furnished an article for the issue of March, 1908,
                    the subject being "Early Commerce in Indiana." He no doubt wrote this paper before
                    he left the state. He also furnished a book review in 1908. Nothing from his pen appears in either
                    1909 or 1910. In fact, he wrote little for the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> after he quit the post of
                    editor until he assumed that position again.</p>
            <p>One essay from Cottman appeared in the March issue of 1911, to which he gave the title
                    "History to Order." He was disgusted with the large amount of historical
                    literature of a popular nature that was being written "to sell" in Indiana. At one
                    point in his short but pithy discussion, he wrote: "In short, there are at least two large
                    publishing companies, each with an organized corps of men in the field [Indiana], whose business it
                    is to see that every (paying) corner ofour state be rescued from oblivion. … To the
                    publishers, the historical portion of the work is, as a rule, less than secondary, its chief value
                    being its service in giving title and pretense to the book."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>During the years when Coleman was editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, there was no great change
                    in the character of its contents. He did not put so much of himself into its pages as had George S.
                    Cottman, but he was better acquainted with persons who were engaged in teaching history in colleges
                    and high schools. As a college teacher of history, he knew more about the historical associations
                    that were growing and increasing in importance and furnished more information about them. He did not
                    lose himself in the historical sources as fully as did Cottman. The two editors of the early period
                    from 1905 to 1913—the largely self-educated man and the university-trained college
                    teacher—supplemented each other to a noticeable degree and cooperated in a fine spirit.
                    Both were honest workmen and they were close friends. They served the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine
                        of History</hi> well during its most critical years.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>Thirty-three quarterly issues of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> were published before it was
                    transferred to Indiana University during 1913. The first eight volumes are very rare, and a few of
                    the issues published from 1913 to 1928 are even more difficult to find, but not many. A very few of

                     <hi rend="sup">17</hi> I did not know Cottman and Coleman during the period from 1905 to
                            1913. I became acquainted with Coleman shortly before he went to Allegheny College in 1920,
                            and I knew him well from 1924 to his death in 1944. From 1928 to the time of his death, we
                            were most of the time in close touch with each other. It was not my good fortune to meet
                            Cottman until about the time when I became editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> in 1928.
                            He was then a neat, kindly gentleman who did not appear to be as old as he was. I am very
                            glad that I was able to publish his article, "The Indiana Magazine of History: A
                            Retrospect," in the December, 1929, <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>.

                    such a venture is worthy of consideration. A study of the career of the first. editor, George S.
                    Cottman, would, in my judgment, furnish an excellent subject for some graduate student preparing a
                    mas-ter's thesis.</p>
            <p>In the first issue of the first volume of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, the editor wrote five pages
                    on the subject, "John Brown Dillon, The Father of Indiana History," that
                    constitutes a short masterpiece.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In the same issue, he reviewed in a series of
                    paragraphs, filling six pages, fifteen books dealing with Indiana history, and mentioned various
                    other writings in that field in a final paragraph. In this effort, his purpose was to make serious
                    and honest appraisals. I feel that no other person could have done a better or a keener job.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> The issues from March, 1905 to June, 1913, include very many short articles.
                    A considerable amount of source material is published in this period, and there are many more or
                    less autobiographical sketches by prominent persons. It was well that material of this kind was
                    obtained and published while still available. There were not many contributions, in this period,
                    from the pens of trained research students, older or younger.</p>
            <p>Articles that in later years would have been accompanied by footnotes, as a rule, are supported by
                    few or none. In fact, the only contribution published in the thirty-two quarterly issues of the
                    first eight volumes that was supplied with as many footnotes as would now be considered adequate was
                    the paper entitled "Some Religious Developments in Indiana," by Christopher B.
                        Coleman.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> This article ran to fourteen pages. The footnotes were not
                    numbered, nor were footnotes numbered in connection with any contribution found in the first eight
                    volumes. All footnotes were designated by symbols, arranged in a certain order, whenever several
                    appeared at the foot of a single page. The aversion to arabic numerals seems strange, since the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> had been using them for more than a decade when the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magaxine of History</hi> was founded. Many articles appeared in the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> for which no footnotes were needed, but some appeared in about every
                    issue that should have been accompanied with footnotes. For example, a good study with the <list type="footnotes">

                    in June, 1908, with only two footnotes, and these were added by the editor to explain points, not as
                    citations to material used by the writer.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Various articles accepted for
                    publication would have taken on an added value for readers had footnotes been employed. These
                    matters are not noticed to detract from the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> of that early period, but
                    only to show what it was like when it was younger.</p>
            <p>It should be mentioned, perhaps, that there is a charm about earlier historical magazines that makes
                    them easy to read. One seems to get close to the writers and especially to the editors. Perhaps the
                    struggling editors of former years succeeded in putting more of themselves into their product. No
                    doubt there was a spirit that went along with bringing out one issue after another under real
                    difficulties that we should not lose as we turn out a product that is technically more and more
                    perfect.</p>
            <p>Having spent a considerable amount of time on the history of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> from 1905
                    to 1913, I feel that it is necessary to become acquainted with the Indiana Historical Society in
                    order to better understand the history of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>. In the early period of the
                    latter, it is well to realize, the Indiana State Library had just gotten a real start on its fine
                    career and had only recently found itself in 1905.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> It was extremely fortunate
                    that the Library had for its head the able William E. Henry from 1897 to 1906 and that he was
                    followed by Demarchus C. Brown. These men were able to do much for the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>
                    during its critical years. It was also in the period when the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> was
                    struggling for its life that the Library's department of archives and history was created
                    by the state library board on the recommendation of the director of the Library, Mr. Henry. Harlow
                    Lindley, head of the department of history of Earlham College, became the first director of this new
                    service of the Indiana State Library. He and his successors were to become willing and helpful
                    allies of the editors of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>.</p>
            <p>Of these several companion agencies of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, it was the Indiana Historical

                    long history, its lapses, its publications, its small membership, its endowment, its timely
                    financial aid to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, especially from 1907 to 1913, have all been
                    noticed. Raising the annual membership fee from $1.00 to $2.00 and making each
                    member a subscriber by paying one-half of the annual dues to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>,
                    beginning with 1913, was an important step, but it did not mean much for almost another decade.
                    Something very significant remained to be accomplished before the Society could play its destined
                    part. A great increase in membership was very essential. After that came, during the years from 1921
                    to 1924, inclusive, the Society had the opportunity to become a vigorous organization.</p>
            <p>As late as December, 1912, Cottman, who was soon to terminate his second period as editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, printed this interesting statement: "The regular annual meeting
                    of the Indiana Historical Society will be held in the office of President Daniel Wait Howe,
                    Thursday, December 26, at 2 o'clock. It is to be regretted that there is not a better
                    attendance at these meetings. The demand upon the members comes only once a year, and the business
                    is of sufficient importance to justify some attention."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was at the end of 1912, but in 1914, under the department headed Minor Notices, there appeared a
                    brief summary of the history of the Indiana Historical Society which gives the membership as
                    seventy-five. In this short discussion of the Society by the editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, Logan Esarey, the third and final paragraph is worth quoting: "It seems
                    that now would be an opportune time to revive interest in the organization and its work. Many
                    leading men have expressed an interest in it lately. There are men and women in Indiana able to do
                    this work as well as it is being done in any other State. Why not have a mass meeting of all persons
                    in the State interested in the work of the Society as soon as the political campaign of the year is
                    over? This is merely a suggestion. It is believed there are 1,000 persons in Indiana sufficiently
                    interested in the work to join the society."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>It is necessary to record that this suggestion of September, 1914, produced no effect. Six years
                    later, the membership of the Society reached about 150, but at last something was about to happen.
                    At the annual meeting of the Indiana Historical Society on December 30, 1920, a committee on
                    membership was appointed which was made up of the newly-elected president, Charles W. Moores,<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Miss Lucy M. Elliott, and Harlow Lindley. Miss Elliott was made the secretary
                    of this committee, and a vigorous canvass for new members was launched at once. This membership
                    drive was so successful that it amounted to a new birth for the Indiana Historical Society, and,
                    since the added members each meant an extra dollar to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> each year, the
                    drive was very much appreciated by Indiana University and the editor, Logan Esarey.</p>
            <p>In the June, 1921, issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> Lucy M. Elliott was able to report that
                    more new members had been added to the Society in six months than had ever before been counted in
                    the total membership in any year of the Society's history. A list of the new members
                    obtained during the half-year was published in the issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> for June,
                    1921, the number being 165.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was at the annual business meeting of December, 1920, that Judge Daniel Wait Howe retired after
                    holding the office of president for twenty years. Charles W. Moores, who succeeded Judge Howe,
                    remained at the head of the Society for only three years, but they were years to be remembered.
                    James A. Woodburn was made the successor of Moores. Jacob Piatt Dunn, long interested in the history

                            income from which could be used to publish monographs and for well-placed subsidies. Most of
                            the early fund of $3,000 was given to the Society by William H. English. Later,

                    March, 1924, issue of the <hi rend="i">Mugazine</hi> published the full list of officers and members
                    of the Society. Counting no names twice, the membership totaled 1,073,<hi rend="sup">27</hi> an
                    astonishing figure to contemplate, when one is acquainted with the story of the Indiana Historical
                    Society from 1830 to 1924, a period close to a century.</p>
            <p>By 1924, when the Society had at last acquired a large membership, Indiana seemed alive with
                    historical agencies. The Indiana State Library had been growing steadily and rendering more
                    excellent service year by year for a little more than a quarter of a century, following a long
                    period of little consequence. The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> could now look back
                    over almost a score of years of struggling successfully against handicaps. The Library's
                    department of archives and history had carried on for a number of years under the supervision of
                    Harlow Lindley. The Indiana Historical Commission was created in 1915. The director of this new
                    agency for several years was Walter C. Woodward of Earlham College, with Lucy M. Elliott as
                    assistant director. In 1919, John W. Oliver became the second director of the Commission. He was a
                    very enthusiastic and active worker in this position for the next four years. Since 1923, he has
                    served until the present time as the head of the department of history at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Harlow Lindley took over the work of Oliver until the readjustments of 1925 were made,
                    when the Commission was superseded by the Indiana Historical Bureau.</p>
            <p>Christopher B. Coleman returned to Indiana from Allegheny College in 1924 to succeed Jacob P. Dunn as
                    the secretary of the Indiana Historical Society. Between 1924 <list type="footnotes">

                    the director of the Indiana Historical Bureau, while continuing his service as secretary of the
                    Indiana Historical Society. He continued to serve in this dual capacity until his death in 1944, and
                    the combination of the two agencies still persists.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>The Society of Indiana Pioneers developed into a well-knit organization with a strong appeal to the
                    public. Its first annual conference was held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in December, 1919. It was a success, as was the second conference in 1920. The third
                    annual conference was sponsored jointly by the Society of Indiana Pioneers, the Indiana Historical
                    Commission and the Indiana Historical Society. This conference was held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the Claypool Hotel on December 9-10, 1921. The attendance at this third meeting was
                    very good, running to more than two hundred.</p>
            <p>Sessions were held in both the afternoon and evening of December 9, and in the forenoon and afternoon
                    of Saturday, December 10. On Friday evening, Governor Samuel M. Ralston read a paper on the first
                    governor of the state, Jonathan Jennings. Several historical papers were read and discussed at the
                    session of Saturday forenoon. A similar program marked the session of Saturday afternoon. Forty-six
                    counties were represented in this conference of 1921. The annual dinner of the Society of Indiana
                    Pioneers, still a feature of the December conference, came on Saturday evening. In 1921 the members
                    and guests sang songs of pioneer times, and Mrs. Demarchus C. Brown talked on the subject,
                    "Some Old-Fashioned Indiana Writers." It was felt by all concerned that the
                    conference on history of 1921 was a very real success. Considering the slowness with which matters
                    related to Indiana history had moved during the first century of the history of the state, the
                    feeling of elation that marked the early 1920's was fully justified. Oliver, as director of
                    the Indiana Historical Commission, who had done so much to make a success of the conference of 1921,
                    declared that the annual conference on Indiana history was "rapidly taking on the nature of
                    a clearing house for state history."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>Several agencies were now working together through the annual conference to promote a keener interest
                    in the history of Indiana. These included the Society of Indiana Pioneers, the Indiana Historical
                    Society, the History Teachers Section of the Indiana Teachers Association, the Indiana Historical
                    Commission, and the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>. The Indiana Historical Commission
                    was succeeded by the Indiana Historical Bureau in 1925, which new agency continued to work with the
                    other agencies, though with increased facilities. For many years I have watched with great
                    satisfaction these several agencies do their work harmoniously. It is remarkable how well so many
                    agencies have worked together. I can recall, personally, a year when an ex-editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and first vice-president (and president-elect) of the Society, gave the
                    address to the Society of Indiana Pioneers at their annual dinner, which address was later published
                    by the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>.</p>
            <p>As stated earlier, Cottman concluded his work as editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> with the
                    March issue of 1913. The succeeding issue, June, 1913, was the first by the new editor, Logan
                    Esarey, who had recently been added to the history faculty of Indiana University to work in the
                    field of western history, with especial attention to Indiana history. The size of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> was not changed during 1913, but the familiar cover used by Editor Cottman was
                    abandoned at once. An article with the title, "Life in Indiana, 1800-1820," by
                    Rola M. Hogue, teacher in the Vincennes High School, was the first article published in the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> accompanied with footnotes designated by arabic numerals. The footnote
                    numbers ran in a single series throughout the article, a total of twenty-nine for nine pages.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Footnotes accompanying articles in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi> have been handled as they were in the June issue of 1913 in every issue since that
                    number.</p>
            <p>The first issue of 1914 was placed in the hands of subscribers with a larger page than in any
                    preceding year and in this respect the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> has not been changed since. Esarey
                    continued to serve as the editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> from June,
                    1913, until the end of the year 1927. As closely as can be determined, he edited fifty-nine

                    appointed to the newly-created position of business manager of the <hi rend="i">Mugaxine</hi>. This
                    addition to the official staff was highly satisfactory to Esarey, who had no interest in the
                    financial duties that had been attached to his editorial responsibilities. Buley continued to serve
                    as business manager of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> until the end of 1931, several years after
                    Esarey resigned the editorship of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a recently appointed member of the history staff of Indiana University, Logan Esarey was the
                    logical person to become the new editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> in 1913. He had been doing
                    intensive research in Indiana history for several years and he was working on the first of his two
                    large volumes of the <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi>. This volume was published in less than
                    two years after he became editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>. The second volume was first
                    offered for sale early in 1919. Esarey had graduate students who completed master's and
                    doctor's theses in the field of Indiana history, some of which were published in whole or
                    in part in the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>. This being true, issues of the <hi rend="i">Mugazine</hi>
                    during the period of Esarey's editorship were naturally somewhat different in character
                    from earlier volumes.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In general, Esarey's plan was to maintain a variety in the contents of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> as the numbers came out, including well-prepared historical papers, source
                    materials, book reviews, historical news, and editorial but he did not hold rigidly to such a
                    regime. Sometimes he brought out an issue, the contents of which consisted of a single study, with
                    all other customary features omitted. In one instance, instead of the two separate quarterly issues
                    for June and September, 1925, one double number was published, offering a single monograph with the
                    title, "The Big Four <list type="footnotes">

                    "The Progressive Party in Indiana," was given all the space in a quarterly issue

            <p>After the year 1924, it was easier to solve the problem of financing the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi> because the Indiana Historical Society had acquired a large membership.
                    Since Esarey served the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> from June, 1913, to the end of 1927, he put in
                    most of his time as editor during ten years when the <hi rend="i">Magazine's</hi> income
                    was low, serving a much shorter period after the income from the Society had greatly increased. It
                    is, of course, to be kept in mind that during the almost fifteen years that Esarey served as editor
                    of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> he taught Indiana history and Western history for the University
                    and was paid for his teaching service. The need for more income for the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>
                    was somewhat discouraging to its editor, but he did much with slender resources, and took in his
                    stride what fell to his lot.</p>
            <p>Before Esarey assumed the duties of editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> he had been made the
                    secretary of the Indiana Historical Survey, a newly-created agency of the department of history. The
                    Survey was provided with an expense fund, and the same person who helped Esarey in his capacity as
                    secretary of the Survey helped him in his capacity as editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>. This
                    permitted a different set-up relative to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> from June, 1913, to the end
                    of 1927, from that which followed, from September, 1928, to September, 1941, when I served as editor
                    of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, since I had nothing to do with the Indiana Historical Survey.</p>

            <p>Readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> first learned to know it relative to the
                    nature of its contents and arrangement from March, 1905, to March, 1913. Except for its cover and
                    larger size, it was not changed much in character for several years after it was moved to Indiana
                    University. As mentioned earlier, a few years after 1913 it was not uncommon for reviews, notes and
                    comments to be omitted oc~asionally.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> This possibly disturbed some of the
                    subscribers who liked to see all departments of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> appear in each issue,
                    though it made it possible to give more space to longer monographs.</p>
            <p>An unusually fine article with the title, "The Approach to History," by Logan
                    Esarey, prepared for the June, 1921, issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, was critical, but keen
                    and very valuable to teachers of history in the public schools. Every teacher of children ought to
                    read it.</p>
            <p>To the last issue brought out by Esarey he contributed the leading article, a thoughtful essay with
                    the title, "The Outlook for History." At the beginning of this very critical study
                    he quoted the first sentence from the first article ever published in the <hi rend="i">American
                        Historical Review</hi>. The sentence read: "Many careful students of modern life assert
                    that they discern in society a widespread discontent with the results of historical study as pursued
                        today."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> This statement was made in 1895, and, after quoting other
                    historians who lived before and after the turn of the century, Esarey felt impelled to offer
                    reflections of his own.</p>
            <p>He held that history is perhaps the most extensive field open to human investigation, and that no
                    searcher after historical truth can expect to accomplish much. He declared that the critical is the
                    proper professional attitude, and added that society has been led to expect from historians, and
                    especially from those who are teaching historians, services that no historian can ever hope to
                    accomplish. Historians themselves are at variance as to the purposes of history. History is limited
                    by evidence, but it is difficult to get many to abide by this truth. As to the notion that by a
                    study of the past, historians can foretell the future-that is, become <list type="footnotes">

                    "spirit of prophecy refused to settle on the historians." Historians did
                    everything to train gatherers of evidence, and do yet, but it did not work and won't work
                    out to the desired end.</p>
            <p>Criticism became a watchword with historians and many students were trained in research. There were
                    plenty of such trainees who missed the boat and plenty of dissertations that looked like pieces of
                    critical research but amounted to little; yet such results did not mean that much good work was not
                    being accomplished, for the truth was that the study of history had made much progress during the
                    generation preceding 1927, when Esarey was writing his essay, "The Outlook for
                    History."</p>
            <p>Proceeding with this discussion, Esarey stated: "As anyone might suspect and as most
                    historians know, the chief difficulty lies in the field of interpretation… The problem is
                    difficult." There is certainly no doubt about this assertion. Those who teach history to
                    college students, continued Esarey, must understand that "merely making the work more
                    difficult is no criterion of collegiate teaching. As nearly as can be expressed the difference lies
                    in vision, view-point and scholarship. Not having received these the undergraduate can scarcely be
                    expected to impart them." When he wrote this critical article, Esarey was discouraged
                    because college textbooks in history were not vastly better. In conclusion, he said, "After
                    all is said, we may wait in the full expectation that time will bring a remedy. The present [1927],
                    hectic, uncritical, period will pass as others have."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>The point has now been reached where I must tell the story of my own period as editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> I had never thought of the possibility of succeeding
                    to the editorship until after the beginning of 1928. I was born and reared in Indiana and had done
                    all of my teaching within the state. I had to know something about Indiana, but I had taken no
                    definite courses in the history of the state. Beyond what I knew from experience and what I knew
                    from studying general American history and had learned through special courses in Western history, I
                    suppose that I had learned more <list type="footnotes">

            <p>I was especially interested in American party history and had been granted a leave of absence that I
                    might go forth and study in different libraries to prepare for writing a history of parties in the <placeName>

                    semester of 1927-1928, so I was there when the editorship of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> became
                    vacant at the end of 1927. By the middle of the University year, that is before the beginning of the
                    second semester, February 1, 1928, I was tied up with the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> I did not
                    begin my period of service until it was necessary to take up work on the September issue of 1928.
                    Someone had to be found to edit the March and June issues of 1928, and Albert L. Kohlmeier, head of
                    the department of history at Indiana University, asked Coleman to take over for six months, which he
                    kindly consented to do. In the March and June issues of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> of 1928,
                    Christopher B. Cole-man's name is properly listed on the title pages as editor. I labored
                    at the job of editor as a side issue from September, 1928, until the June number appeared in the
                    summer of 1941.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>The first issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> after I was placed in charge came out as of
                    September, 1928. There was little or no matter for publication on hand and some hurried searching
                    and planning were required. Somehow, we succeeded in getting the two remaining quarterly issues for
                    the year published and in the hands of subscribers before the end of 1928, but those two issues will
                    always carry some marks of haste.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> My desire was to publish in each quarterly
                    issue two or more well prepared historical papers, and to carry in addition a fair amount of source

                     <hi rend="sup">40</hi> Before I assumed my duties as editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, I was carrying regularly twelve hours of work as my teaching load, which was
                            the same as that of any regular professor. Because of my new editorial duties, I was
                            relieved of the work of teaching one of my two classes in general American history, which
                            was a three-hour course. When faculty salaries were cut in the midst of the depression, I
                            experienced the same reduction, or rather a reduction on the same basis, as other faculty
                            members. I had one student assistant on the Magazine, whose stipend was very small, but he
                            received a proportionate cut. I am glad that I learned to like editorial work, and that my
                            successive assistants accepted what came cheerfully. I should not forget to say that our
                            incomes were later readjusted upwards.</item>

                    1930, beginning with the December issue, two pages were reserved for the Indiana Historical Society.
                    In March, 1934, a similar section was set aside for history teachers, and labeled History Teachers
                    Forum. In September, 1936, a distinctly new department was added to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>

            <p>During my thirteen years as editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, I varied the section of Comment
                    and News considerably, perhaps too often. As our country and the world moved along into more serious
                    economic and social conditions, I tended to deal more with topics related to troubled situations
                    than with historical problems. I received one complaint from a subscriber who had become worried
                    about me; a mature businessman, he charged that my comments read like quotations from current
                    Democratic platforms. This was near the middle-thirties when reactionaries were beginning to fear
                    for the future of the economic system. I have reread my comments of the period from 1931 to 1936 and
                    I can find nothing that smacks of partisanship, though a tinge of liberalism pervades my
                    discussions.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of 1936, I substituted the heading Editor's Pages for Comment and News.
                    Earlier I had shortened Comment and News to Comment. I don't recall whether or not I did so
                    because it was easier to manufacture comment than to gather news—possibly so. In the
                    March issue of 1936 I published the first installment of what I called "The Beginnings of a
                    Possible Autobiography.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> These chapters or installments ran up to twelve in
                    all, the last appearing in the December issue of 1938. A title was given to each chapter and the
                    story covered the first fifty years of my life. I have never yet written anything beyond 1920,
                    though almost thirty-five years have been added to my life since that year closed.</p>
            <p>During my period of editorship, I did not find it difficult to obtain manuscripts for publication
                    from writers who were well known. It was also possible to publish various suitable studies prepared
                    by graduate students, and I published quite <list type="footnotes">

                    prepared by writers not trained in graduate seminars whose work could easily be missed entirely. It
                    had been very necessary for the founder of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> to go afield for material,
                    which he did; and he set a good example by laboring with untrained persons, who really had something
                    to contribute. Partially prepared, or even poorly prepared, it was still valuable matter to him for
                    revision and publication. I felt, while editor, that there was still some need in Indiana for the
                    kind of work done by Cottman. Coleman agreed with this notion and commended my adherence to it in
                    the last issue published while I was editor, saying that I had made the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>
                    to a degree "the vehicle for publication of worthwhile articles written by others than
                    professional historians and graduate students. The <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> has thus greatly
                    promoted interest in Indiana history outside university and college walls. Doubtless a majority of
                    the readers of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> are men and women not directly connected with academic
                        life."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>It was in the early period of my editorship of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> that its twenty-fifth
                    anniversary arrived at the end of 1929. At this time, the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, in conjunction
                    with the Indiana Historical Society, prepared and published the <hi rend="i">General Index</hi> for
                    volumes I to XXV, inclusive. The preparation of copy was done by Dorothy Riker, a member of the
                    staff of the Society and the Indiana Historical Bureau. The expense of printing was borne by the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and the printing was done by the Indiana University Printing Plant. The
                    index was a success from the first and has been very useful to hosts of persons. Considerable time
                    has passed since the cost of printing the index in 1930 very nearly snuffed the life out of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and paralyzed the editor for a time. Now, under rosier conditions, an
                    index for the second twenty-five years is in the offing.</p>
            <p>When I became the editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> I had much to learn. By

                    was placed in charge in the late summer of 1928, I had done some thinking about the work of an
                    editor of a quarterly magazine of history as the following paragraph will reveal: "The

                    <pb n="25" id="VAA4025-051-1-035"/> work of an editor is neither a simple nor an easy task. He must
                    read critically such papers as are submitted for publication, in order to discover as far as
                    possible errors of fact, of composition and of form. He must assume the responsibility of deciding
                    whether the quality of articles submitted is such as to justify publication. He must reject papers
                    that are not up to a fair level of merit, or that are not adapted to the purpose of the magazine. He
                    must somehow discover unpublished documents of value, and find persons who have the capacity to
                    write. He should, at times, advise those willing to prepare articles, and point out to them ways in
                    which their work may be improved. At the worst he may, occasionally, find his barrel as barren of
                    matter suitable for publication, as Mother Hubbard found her cupboard bare of bones for her dog. The
                    magazine will be due, nevertheless, in March, June, September and December of each

            <p>I found the task of editing the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> very congenial. It
                    required much time and energy. When I consented to serve as editor, I was giving time to research in
                    the field of American party history. I continued work along this line and brought out a volume to
                    which the title, <hi rend="i">Fifty Years of Party Warfare</hi>, was given. My editorial work slowed
                    up my writing, but even so, the book was published sooner than it should have been, as I have
                    thought about it since. Though I succeeded in gathering a large amount of further material on party
                    history relating to the period following that covered by my published volume, I did not get ready,
                    in my judgment, to offer the copy for a second volume to my publisher. I do not make excuses for my
                    failure, but it is not unreasonable to claim that thirteen consecutive years of editorial duties did
                    at least partly explain my inability to complete at least another volume of party history. I have
                    made the foregoing comments mainly that I may say that editing a magazine of history, in my
                    judgment, deserves as much credit as doing research that results in writing and publishing books. I
                    wonder if those who praise productive historical work have done justice to editors of historical
                    magazines and others absorbed in similar activities?</p>

            <p>I have mentioned that I published a considerable number of articles that came from master's
                    and doctor's theses—that is, work of graduate students in history. I have also
                    called attention to the fact that I often labored with articles turned in by untrained writers who
                    had good material to offer. I should add that from 1928 to 1941, I received a very large number of
                    articles for publication from persons who were prominent. The greater number of these were residents
                    of Indiana, but not all. As I look over the contents of fifty-two issues, I am astonished at the
                    number of contributions that were offered to me for publication by members of college and university
                    faculties. Checking them carefully, I find that I accepted at least fifty offerings from college and
                    university teachers. I do not recall that I solicited any of these papers or documents-certainly
                    very few, if any. I have counted along with college teachers a few librarians or officials of
                    historical societies who were equivalent in rank with faculty members.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>In the period of my editorship of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, I had the help
                    of a long line of assistants, one at a time. These were excellent students who were willing to work
                    and who appreciated the small stipend received from the University. It was necessary for each of
                    them to do typing, of which there was a fair amount. Each of the students who served me in
                    connection with the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> during my thirteen years as editor was a good

            <p>The present editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> is John D. Barnhart,
                    professor of American history at Indiana University. His special courses have included Indiana
                    history since he joined the faculty of the department of history in the summer of 1941. Unlike his
                    immediate predecessor, he did not have to annex an unexpected specialty. The first issue published
                    after he became the editor was that of September, 1941. He has, therefore, already edited fifty-four
                    issues, <list type="footnotes">

                            much while I was editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> but that seems out of the
                            question. If the opportunity comes and the interest is great enough, the reader should take
                            some time and look through the files of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>.</item>

                    <pb n="27" id="VAA4025-051-1-037"/> not counting the current number. As yet, the highest record is
                    that of Esarey, who brought out fifty-nine issues in all.</p>
            <p>Barnhart is a graduate of Illinois Wesleyan University, where he received an A.B. degree in 1916. He
                    was granted a master's degree by Northwestern University in 1919, and received his
                    doctor's degree from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1930. He first came to Indiana University as a visiting professor during the year
                    1924-1925, and returned in 1941, after serving on the faculties of the University of West Virginia
                    and Louisiana State University for a number of years.</p>
            <p>In 1945, Barnhart succeeded in employing an assistant editor, which was a step upward for the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> in many ways. He obtained the services of Elfrieda Lang, who worked
                    full-time for the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> from 1945 to 1953. After she was granted a
                    doctor's degree in 1950, she became research associate in history in addition to being the
                    assistant editor. In 1953, she severed her connection with the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, for which
                    she had done so much, and became assistant curator of manuscripts in the Indiana University Library.
                    In 1953, Kathleen Nolan succeeded Miss Lang as assistant editor and continues to fill that position
                    with skill and efficiency.</p>
            <p>A colorful new cover was adopted by the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> in 1947. Howard H. Peckham, then
                    secretary of the Indiana Historical Society, was responsible for instigating the change and having
                    the new format designed.</p>
            <p>While the nature and contents of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> have not changed
                    abruptly nor very extensively at any time or in any period, there have been, as a matter of course,
                    considerable change and variation with the passing of fifty years. Such modifications as have been
                    made have been improvements in harmony with those made by similar journals published over the
                    country, especially the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi>, the <hi rend="i">
                  <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Review</hi>, and the <hi rend="i">Journal of Southern History.</hi> This is as it should be. It does result in giving historical
                    magazines a more technical appearance, and possibly causes them to present a less attractive aspect
                    to certain groups who like to read articles in historical journals. Certain types of critics have,
                    in recent years, been prone to express their dislike of articles "cluttered up with
                    footnotes," and such opinions have had an influence. In so far as I can see, it should not
                    bother any reader to find an article accompanied by footnotes, even many of them. <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-051-1-038"/> No reader is obliged to notice footnotes, if he prefers to ignore them.</p>
            <p>Entirely aside from the objections of those who just don't like footnotes, there is
                    something that is worthy of consideration. This is the fact that there are types of historical
                    articles that require few or no footnotes, which are still worthy of publication in historical
                    magazines. Such offerings are gladly received and published. They are usually written by persons who
                    helped to make the history of some big event, like a war or a battle, or participated in making the
                    history of a state, a county or a community. They seldom use footnotes, and often do not need any.
                    In Indiana, for example, such articles are often written and offered for publication by well-known
                    men and women, but also by intelligent citizens not well-known outside their own communities. For a
                    good many years after the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> was born, the editors
                    received and frequently published historical articles of this kind, and such articles were apt to be
                    the first read. That fewer of them have been published as the magazine has grown older is not
                    because such articles have been rejected by the editors, but because they have not been written.
                    Hoosiers who lived in the pioneer age of Indiana passed from the scene some years ago, even the last
                    of them.</p>
            <p>The question that now arises is how can an editor of a magazine of history obtain and publish
                    historical articles such as those that older men and women who lived in the pioneer period once
                    prepared and submitted for publication? I feel that I have at least a partial answer. It was shortly
                    after 1900, in the main, that the automobile, the airplane, wireless messages and various other new
                    and transforming inventions, especially pertaining to war, appeared and made over our modes of
                    living. Persons yet living who were born before 1890 passed through experiences that now set them
                    apart from the younger elements that compose much of the population of our country. What they
                    learned from experience before 1900, to give a rough date, is as important as what aging pioneers
                    gave to the public some years ago, and just as unknown and unfamiliar to most of our people today.
                    What survivors of the 1880's and the 1890's can do for the people of this new age
                    is to write about the period that only they know from experience. They should produce some
                    historical writing that will include short papers, <pb n="29" id="VAA4025-051-1-039"/>
                    reminiscences, and autobiographies, and unearth matter that has been written and not published. All
                    of this will tend to enrich the contents of future issues of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, and
                    give pleasure to large numbers of readers who have only a mild interest in articles supported by
                    footnote reference.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I go through the fifty-four issues published since the summer of 1941, I can say that there are
                    many very well-developed articles, numerous documents of great interest and value, and scores of
                    carefully prepared book reviews. The contents of the many issues have been helpful and stimulating
                    to numerous habitual readers through the years. Historical students have not only read but have
                    gathered information useful to them from the various issues and have greatly widened the benefits of
                    the special articles and the documents. Best of all, copies of all back numbers will stand on
                    library shelves everywhere and will serve researchers and likewise any who like to seek interesting
                    and valuable historical matter for the purpose of reading and enjoying it.</p>
            <p>Earlier in this history of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, I called attention to the large numbers of
                    college and university faculty members who furnished articles to the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine
                        of History</hi> while I served as editor. I have found by checking that twice as many, if not
                    more, of such contributors have furnished articles, documents, and reviews to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> since 1941. The number of articles coming from master's and
                    doctor's theses also shows an increase. The number of contributions from persons who are
                    not members of college or university faculties nor graduate students does not reveal much change.
                    Offerings from surviving pioneers show a steady decline from 1905 to the present, but nothing else
                    could be true. Changing economic, social, and political conditions bring about changes in the
                    contents of historical journals as in about every other phase of life. It is only possible to
                    attempt to exert an influence, in a small way, towards sanity in regard to the process of
                    transformation that is bound to continue.</p>

                        age just as did the pioneer of an earlier bygone age. However, they have not revealed what they
                        know as fully as did those surviving pioneers who preceded them. Editors of historical
                        magazines, therefore, have a job to perform.</item>

            <p>It is a difficult task to pass judgement on the nature and contents of a historical magazine for a
                    considerable period, but I must say that the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> has held
                    up to a high standard during the years since September 1, 1941. The array of studies published
                    reveals a high quality. Especial care has been exercised in fitting individual reviewers to their
                    task. It is particularly noticeable that able contributors, well scattered over the country, are
                    very willing to see their writings find a place in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History.</hi> The tendencies of any period are apt to influence too strongly a journal of any state
                    or area, but our Indiana specimen seems to have kept a character of its own. One can only express a
                    hope that, if it should vary from this quality in the future, it will show greater rather than less
                    of independence.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>As a final word, I can only say that in a busy and exacting period of my life I gave a lot of my
                    life's blood to the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, and that I can never

                    historical romance. Major's first book, it was destined to become a best-seller and to
                    remain high on the best-seller lists for fifteen consecutive months. In scarcely more than a year it

                    was English and French history of the Renaissance, and he perused carefully many diaries, memoirs,
                    and state papers, especially of the Tudor age in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. He believed that the original sources of history—the chronicles, memoirs,
                    and letters—yielded the essential life of a period and its people, and that the author
                    who wished to impart historic atmosphere to his work should acquire an intimate knowledge of the
                    conditions prevailing at the time of which he meant to write. Thus when he came to write his first
                    book, he brought to his work a mass of accurate historical knowledge.</p>
            <p>During the remainder of his life after the publication of <hi rend="i">When Knighthood Was in
                    Flower</hi> Major devoted most of his spare time to writing and chiefly to historical novels. Since
                    the works were done in leisure moments, his completion of nine books in the relatively short space
                    of fourteen years is a noteworthy achievement.</p>
            <p>What exactly first led Major to attempt the novel is not known. Out of his reading of history had

            <p>The story of how the idea for <hi rend="i">When Knighthood Was in Flower</hi> came to Major reveals
                    his method in applying history to romance—or <hi rend="i">vice versa</hi>. According to
                    an account by an English critic, James Milne, quoted by Jacob P. Dunn, Major's reading of
                    François Pierre Guillaume Guizot's <hi rend="i">History of <placeName>

                    forbidding the marriage. Out of these two relatively minute details, then, and with the aid of his
                    wide knowledge of the period in general, Major wove the story that was to prove a best-seller.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever his original intention, Major did submit the book to Harper and Brothers. Unfortunately for
                    them-as it later turned out—Harper's rejected it. But not long thereafter, Lee
                    Burns, then a salesman for the Bowen-Merrill Publishing Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> (now Bobbs-Merrill), stopped in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to try to sell Major a set of law books. Major's sales resistance was high and
                    no law books were sold, but in the course of the conversation Burns learned that Major had a
                    manuscript which Harper's had rejected. Major wondered if Bowen-Merrill might possibly
                    consider it. The result was that Lee Burns took the manuscript to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the publishers. John J. Curtis, at that time head of the publishing end of the firm,
                    read the book and liked everything but Major's original title, <hi rend="i">Charles
                        Brandon, Duke of Suffolk</hi>, which he felt was hardly suggestive of a colorful and exciting
                    tale of sixteenth-century love at the court of Henry VIII. This problem apparently disturbed him a
                    great deal, but one day he found a solution in the opening lines of "The Gentle
                    Armour," a poem by the early nineteenth century romantic writer, Leigh Hunt: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>As in many of the books of the day, the subtitle is also interesting and expressive of the contents

                    of historical novels, employed pseudonyms. Even so well known a writer as Mark Twain chose to remain
                    anonymous in <hi rend="i">his Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc</hi> (1896), although part of
                    his desire was to insure that the book would be taken seriously rather than be regarded as a
                    humorous work because of its author's reputation. Just as Twain's book pretended
                    to be a translation by one John François Alden of a memoir left by the personal secretary
                    of Joan of Arc, so Major's author was Edwin Caskoden, who wrote the story supposedly based
                    on the memoir of his ancestor and namesake, Sir Edwin Caskoden, Master of the Dance to Henry

            <p>The book's success was immediate and immense, and the identity of its author did not long
                    remain hidden. It was considered most remarkable—and indeed it was—that an
                    amateur could have written so popular a work. During much of 1899 it was one of the three most
                    popular novels sold and for the first six months of 1900 continued among the top five
                        best-sellers.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Besides its financial success as a book, <hi rend="i">When

                    then as a comic opera, and finally as a motion picture.</p>
            <p>The account of how the novel came to be dramatized is well worth the retelling. Soon after its

                    of the work and requesting permission to produce it as a play. While he was still considering this
                    proposition, Major received a telegram from none other than Julia Marlowe, the great Shakespearean
                    actress. It read: "I want the dramatic rights to When Knighthood was in Flower."

            <p>What I wish to discuss here, chiefly, are Charles Major's works and his place in American
                    literary history. As indicated earlier, he wrote nine books in all. Second in popularity to <hi rend="i">When Knighthood Was in Flower was Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall</hi>, published in
                    1902, which also enjoyed a large sale and a successful run as a play. Set in the time of the trouble
                    between Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots, the book recounts the trials and tribulations of the
                    high-spirited Dorothy Vernon in her—we shall have to say it—pursuit of Sir
                    John Manners, the dashing son of her father's long-time enemy. Not that Sir John was
                    actually unwilling, of course, but there were many family complications. <hi rend="i">Dorothy
                    Vernon</hi> was followed in 1905 by <hi rend="i">Yolanda, Maid of Burgundy</hi>, a tale of sixteenth

            <p>Meanwhile, however, Major combined his interest in the past of Europe with a concern for local
                    themes. Among his lesser-known novels was <hi rend="i">A Forest Hearth</hi>. Published in 1903, and
                    his fourth book in point of chronology, it tells of Indiana pioneer life in the 1830's. But
                    probably best-remembered and best-loved of his books with Indiana settings are <hi rend="i">The
                        Bears of <geogName>Blue River</geogName>
               </hi> (1901) and that series of adventures related by
                    one Thomas Andrew William Addison, better known as <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom Andy Bill</hi> (1908).
                    These exciting stories are complete with all of the action, suspense, and danger dear to the hearts
                    of boys everywhere. They describe how Balser Brent, the precocious thirteen-year-old hero, his
                    younger brother Jim, and their friend Tom Fox, in <hi rend="i">The Bears of <geogName>Blue
                        River</geogName>
               </hi>, and Balser and Tom Andy Bill Addison, in <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom Andy
                    Bill</hi>, battle bears, wolves, and even the elements for their very existence. Few Hoosiers are
                    not familiar with these stories.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all fairness, it must be said that rereading these boys' books is something of a
                    disappointment of the sort that is experienced when one revisits a house in which he lived as a
                    child. Everything seems different somehow—smaller, and not so glamorous as he had
                    remembered. But there is no doubt that for years to come most boys—and many girls,
                    too—will thrill to the bravery and the hairbreadth escapes of these young heroes.</p>
            <p>Entertaining as these books have been to generations of Indianians, however, it is Major's
                    historical novels that place him in closest touch with American literary movements. The historical
                    novel was by no means a new genre in American literature in the 1890's, having been popular

                    works in the 1820's, ′30'S, and ′40's. But, during
                    the 1870's and ′80's the star of the historical novels and romances
                    waned as the works of the so-called realists began to capture the public's
                    fancy—especially those of William Dean Howells and Mark Twain, though the
                    latter's <hi rend="i">The Prince and the Pauper</hi> (1881) was directly in the historical
                    tradition. The works of Henry James, too, though they did not become anything resembling
                    best-sellers, had a great influence on subsequent writing. Thus, as the trend toward realism
                    increased, the vogue of romance declined, though, of course, it never died, nor ever will.</p>
            <p>But in the late 1890's came an extraordinary resurgence of enthusiasm for romances in

               </hi> and noted critic of the period, wrote of this phenomenon in May, 1900:
                    "Just how deep and powerful the present distinct movement toward a romantic revival may be
                    no one can tell. Many facts, however, point to a veering of popular interest from the fiction of
                    character analysis and social problems to the historical novel and the romance of heroic adventure.
                    We have had a period of intense, not to say morbid, introversion directed mainly upon diseases of
                    the social, domestic, political and religious life of the world. It may be that, like all other
                    currents of interest when turned upon insoluble problems, this rush of inquiry, this strain of
                    exploitation, has about run its course. … Great commercial interest seems to be turned or
                    turning from the novel of commonplace life and the story of the analysis of crime and filth to the
                    historical romance, the story of heroism and the tale of adventure. People seem to be interested as

                    the years, roughly, 1896-1902. And of course the work of Charles Major was part and parcel of this

                    presenting the alleged backgrounds of the story, describe very accurately the chief attributes and

                    retains its shadowy lack of sharp detail, toning down and mellowing the hard aspect of real

            <p>Besides showing Charles Major in the forefront of this movement, the foregoing list also reveals a
                    fact of general interest to Hoosiers. Of the twenty-five authors of the thirty-one books, no less
                    than four, as indicated in brackets, were Indianians. No other single state could claim as many.

            <p>It is common knowledge that the literary output of Indiana has long been a source of admiration and
                    wonder. And not without cause. A study has been made of the ten bestselling novels during each year
                    from 1900 to 1940, in which the books were scored ten points for the number one bestseller, nine
                    points for the second best, eight for the third, and so on. The birthplace of each author was
                    ascertained and the states credited with the scores of the authors born in them. Indiana garnered
                    213 points, second only to <placeName>

                    except one elderly gentleman. When Read had recovered somewhat from his shock, he expressed interest
                    in the fact that there was at least one Hoosier who was <hi rend="i">not</hi> an author.</p>

            <p>To return to the historical novel—strangely enough, this "Indian Summer of
                    Romance" came to a rather abrupt end shortly after 1902, a fact which accounts for the
                    relative lack of success of Major's later books. Its sudden cessation is not easily
                    explained. There is no doubt that it had been sustained by the Spanish-American War, which many saw
                    as a gallant struggle by the oppressed Cubans to rid themselves of the burdensome yoke of the
                    wicked, though still glamorous, Spanish—a war fought partly in the romantic Caribbean,
                    the fabulous Spanish Main of pirate days. And after the war the spirit lingered, with heroes being
                    sought in the novels after the heroes of the actual conflict had faded away. "In
                    ‘When Knighthood Was in Flower’ or ‘Monsieur Beaucaire’
                    or ‘To Have and to Hold’ the hero could hold at bay two or three of the best
                    swordsmen of the land and win the beautiful heroine in the end."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> And
                    great was the appeal thereof. But the era ended swiftly, and historical romances vanished from the
                    best-seller lists almost overnight. Perhaps as valid an explanation of the phenomenon as any is that
                    suggested by Pattee, who observes that upon the succession of Teddy Roosevelt to the presidency and
                    the resulting widespread popularity of the latter's philosophy of "the strenuous
                    life," the nation's reading habits were abruptly changed. The term
                    "mollycoddle" came into vogue to describe anyone who was not entirely
                    "manly" in his outlook and activities.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Thus perhaps the
                    reading of historical romance became, or was considered to have become, the province of the
                    "mollycoddle," with the result that even women forsook the costumed heroes of the
                    romances for the brawnier heroes of writers like Jack London.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, Charles Major's works will be long rememberod in American literary history. To
                    be thoroughly honest and objective, however, we must admit that, dear as they are to the hearts of
                    Hoosiers, their place has not been determined by intrinsic literary merit. They have the
                    characteristics of the historical novels of the time—overly rhetorical and bombastic
                    language; heroes possessing impossible skill, bravery, and foresight; plots determined largely by
                    coincidence. Modern critics do not always deal kindly with Major. One contemporary scholar writes:
                    "Although his importance may be said to be entirely in the historical field, Major made no
                    real contribution to the development of the historical novel created by Scott and Americanized by
                    Cooper. He had their faults but seldom possessed their powers."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> But
                    the books do tell an exciting story, and Major certainly holds his own in the genre with his
                    contemporaries—writers like Maurice Thompson, George Barr McCutcheon, and the early
                    Tarkington.</p>
            <p>All in all, then, Charles Major's fame will rest chiefly on his having been an integral part
                    of the turn-of-the-century heyday of historical romance. Indeed, his two most popular books can be
                    said almost to mark its boundaries, since <hi rend="i">When Knighthood Was in, Flower</hi> appeared
                    in 1898, just as the movement was getting well under way, while <hi rend="i">Dorothy Vernon</hi> was
                    only slightly less a success in 1902, the year that seems to have marked its close. Thus, no
                    literary discussion of these years is complete without reference to Charles Major. And more than any
                    other single title, <hi rend="i">When Knighthood Was in Flower</hi> has become typical, and even
                    symbolic, of the unusual renaissance of romance.</p>
            <p>In summary, I shall simply borrow the words of William M. Hepburn, Librarian Emeritus of Purdue
                    University, who in 1946 wrote of Charles Major: "All things considered, it would seem that
                    he well deserves a place in the Hoosier Hall of Fame."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> has been abundantly described by early English travelers who came to it in the course
                    of their travels and in some cases remained there for a time. It was on a well-defined line of
                    travel and could hardly have been avoided; besides, the travelers wanted to see the famous
                    "beautiful <geogName>Wabash Valley</geogName>." Morris Birkbeck, George Flower,
                    Elias Pym Fordham, William Faux, and Thomas Hulme were all there before 1820 and all wrote about it.
                    Their descriptions do not agree, being colored by their individual purposes and characteristics of
                    temperament.</p>
            <p>Birkbeck had emigrated to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1817, where his friend George Flower, who had gone before, joined him. Together they
                    conceived a project to colonize a large tract of prairie land in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Edwards County</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>.
                    Birkbeck was a propagandist, determined to bring to the area more English settlers, who would buy
                    land from him and help to build him up as a great landed proprietor and political leader. His
                    account of America<hi rend="sup">5</hi> was published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1817 and in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> the next year and immediately had a wide distribution both in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and abroad.</p>
            <p>George Flower, younger than Birkbeck though not in his first youth, had left two half-grown sons in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Like Birkbeck, he had large sums of ready money to invest in the new venture and hoped
                    to influence a great many of his English acquaintances to join him. His book<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                    was not written until years after his experiences took place, when he was an old man, long since
                    retired from the scenes and events described.</p>

            <p>Fordham's narrative<hi rend="sup">7</hi> was not intended for publication at all, but
                    consisted of journals and letters written on the spot to relatives and friends at home. Some member
                    of the family must have thought they were worthy of publication, however, for copies of portions of
                    them, made by another hand and with the names omitted, were found long afterwards; they were first
                    published in 1906. Fordham was a different type altogether. A brilliant and successful young
                    engineer, twenty-nine years old, he was a favorite pupil, it is said, of the famous George
                    Stephenson, "father of English railways." The young man came to America with
                    Birkbeck in 1817, apparently in a pure spirit of adventure and a love of sport, especially of
                    hunting. He found abundant use in the Western Countries for his surveying abilities. Intelligent and
                    fairminded, anxious to give an impartial report of all he saw, he was not blind to defects but was
                    willing to excuse them.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>William Faux, on the other hand, in his journal of an American tour<hi rend="sup">9</hi> which took
                    place in 1819, gives evidence of a sharp eye for shortcomings and a sharp tongue for criticizing
                    them. He was acquainted with many English settlers: "Mr. Pittiss, late of the Isle of
                    Wight," and "my Huntingdonshire friends, Mr. and Mrs. John Ingle."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> He looked up many others, among them Charles Phillips from Somersetshire,
                    William Peck of Chatteris, James Maidlow, a Hampshire farmer and a neighbor of William
                    Cobbett's, George Potts, from Stockport in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cheshire</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Saunders Hornbrook from Devonshire.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Faux said his object in
                    coming to America was to find out the real condition and prospects of the crowds of immigrants who
                    had already come. A good antidote to Birkbeck, he was often sharply critical and inclined to
                    minimize what had been accomplished.</p>
            <p>Thomas Hulme in the summer of 1818 made a journey to the Western Countries which produced a journal.

                    dozen cabins…" situated in the woods. Birkbeck wrote the same year that the town
                    contained about fifty houses.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Faux, there two years later, wrote:
                    "The little town just quitted, and at which I paid the extravagant price of two dollars a

                    or brick to be used as taverns began to go up around the square. The first courthouse was dedicated

                    places than river bottoms, the fevers and agues of the fall and summer being worse in the lowlands.
                    Besides, the remoteness from rivers was considered a moral advantage because river towns were looked
                    upon as dangerously profligate. Morris Birkbeck observed: "There are about two thousand
                    people employed as boatmen on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    who settle along the line of this grand navigation, possess or acquire similar habits, and thus
                    profligacy of manners seems inseparable from the population on the banks of these great rivers. It
                    is remarked indeed every where, that inland navigators are worse than sailors." On the
                    other hand, he wrote that though <placeName>

                    </placeName> was at the furthest limits of Indiana, still it afforded respectable
                    society—"as many well-informed, genteel people, in proportion to the number of
                    inhabitants, as any county town that I am acquainted with … and not one decidedly vicious

                    </placeName> was wooded, the timber was not so dense and impenetrable as elsewhere. It is difficult
                    today to realize what it meant to live in the gloom of the ever-present forests, or to struggle on
                    day after day through the dark miles of awesome, never-ending woods, and what an overwhelming,
                    almost impossible task it seemed to clear them. The travelers of that day attest how terribly the
                    formidable forests oppressed their spirits and with what elation they emerged from them and beheld
                    the open sky. "I shrank," wrote George Flower, "from the idea of settling

                    who had been so long buried in deep forests. It is a feeling of confinement which begins to damp the
                    spirits, by this complete exclusion of distant objects. To travel, day after day, among trees of a
                    hundred feet high, without a glimpse of the surrounding country, is oppressive to a degree which
                    those connot [sic] conceive who have not experienced it; and it must depress the spirits of the
                    solitary settler to pass years in this state. His visible horizon extends no farther than the tops
                    of the trees which bound his plantation, perhaps five hundred yards. Upwards he sees the sun, and
                    sky, and stars; but, around him, an eternal forest, from which he can never hope to
                    emerge." Birkbeck dreams of the day when "America shall have cleared away her
                    forests, and opened her uplands to the breezes. …"<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fordham wrote much the same. "America, however, is not the land of prospects. There is too
                    much wood; and, when on the barren peak of some rocky hill, you catch a distant view, it generally
                    is nothing but an undulating surface of impenetrable forests. … It is seldom that a view
                    of 200 yards in extent, can be caught in Indiana. The woods west of the Mountains are not, as Mrs.
                    W. says in the <hi rend="i">wrongs</hi> of woman, ‘clustering forests of small
                    trees.’ It is a long time before an English eye becomes accustomed to their size and
                    grandeur." "When the forests recede from the valleys, and verdure clothes the
                    hills, and villages are scattered through wastes, North America will become a beautiful and
                    picturesque country."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>The author considers herself fortunate to have seen a tract of Indiana's primeval forest

                    trunks of most of them and they seemed to soar immeasurably aloft, an unbelievably beautiful sight.
                    Scattered sparsely over the dim forest floor were occasional wild flowers not often found in
                    southern Indiana's woods today: frail white orchis, closed gentians, a few leaves of
                    hepatica. But mostly we were conscious only of the majestical columns of the dark, towering,
                    threatening trees, indeed an awesome sight; so might tall stalks of ripe wheat look to an ant
                    crawling on the ground between them. "Climb into this," said young Mr. Nickey to
                    me, motioning to a high two-wheeled cart near by. "I want to show you the maple swamp and
                    the track is too narrow for the surrey." The maple swamp proved to be a more open spot in
                    the forest, a thicket of sumac and other bushes. As we were threading our way along, he suddenly
                    halted his horse, just as a loud whirring noise filled the air as if the whole forest were getting
                    up. He seized my shoulder and spun me round: "Look quick," he said.
                    "You'll never see that again as long as you live." It was a wild turkey,
                    rising over the brush and lumbering off into the open, its wings dark against the sky.</p>

                    edges of the woodlands to see the flowering dogwoods. Almost all of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName>'s first settlers were originally from the British Isles. The French and the
                    Spanish were so few that they could be identified minus their names. "The
                    Frenchman" who kept store in "the Long Ornary"; the
                    "Spaniard" who was killed by a falling tree while passing by Robb's; the
                    "Dutch woman" to whom George Brownlee was instructed by the county in 1821 to give
                    a quart of wine—these were anonymous. But the English who came here in the first decade
                    of 1800 were already Americans. Their fathers had settled first on the eastern seaboard, in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, or in South <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-051-1-062"/> Carolina, and then had come by easy
                    stages, by mule back, by ox cart, by pirogue or flatboat, through <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, stopping in various places along the way to raise a crop of some kind or to make money
                    by whatever skills they might possess so as to replenish their stores; they were thus beyond the
                    pioneer stage when they reached the boundaries of the Hoosier State and were well qualified to
                    select a permanent home. They knew what pitfalls to look out for and to avoid.</p>
            <p>Many of the settlers disliked the social conditions created by slavery and were determined to leave
                    the institution behind them. Many of them, having taken out good land elsewhere and lost it by a
                    faulty title due to incompetent surveying, were not to be taken in a second time: they had heard
                    that the Indiana system of land tenure was unassailable. One of the most beneficent and farseeing
                    acts of Congress in organizing the Northwest Territory was that regulating the survey of the land: a
                    system of rectangles based on meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude, it was easy to
                    comprehend but hard to circumvent. When, after the Napoleonic wars and after our treaties with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and with the Indians, settlers began pouring into the state to take up government lands
                    in the wilderness they were comforted and encouraged by the security this act of Congress afforded
                    them. Some of course were moved by no such rational motives. They came because they were restless,
                    because the pastures always look greener on the other side of the fence and they hoped to better
                    their lot. They came because they wanted to see what the half-hidden blazed trails in the dim
                    forests led to. They came because they were Englishmen and the lust "For to admire and for
                    to see, for to be old this world so wide," always latent in an Englishman's
                    breast, now broke all bounds. They came, too, because they were adventurous, because, in short, they
                    were young. In fact, Fordham thought perhaps it should be restricted to them. "I am not
                    sure," he wrote, "that English elderly people would do right to pass the
                    mountains. The ocean is a mere nothing; and if all I hear of <placeName>

                    territory will be the best to settle in. But, alas, it is another world; not only distant but
                    distinct from Europe. …"<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Not all of the young adventurers, however, would have agreed with him. They sent back glowing
                    accounts to their elders and often the whole family group pulled up stakes and followed them; but it
                    was the young people who set the tone. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> there were few refugees from tyranny, few religious bigots or utopian dreamers. Nor
                    were there penniless vagabonds. It took money to come West, as Fordham sternly asserted in a letter
                    home: "you cannot do a greater favour to any young man, who possesses from 800£
                    to 5,000£, with a proper degree of spirit, than by sending him out here. But if he has no
                    money, if he knows no mechanical trade, and if he cannot work,—he had better stay in a

                    do far better to push out westward past the eastern cities and the Atlantic states, because they
                    could live cheaply in the West.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>The settlers' reasons for remaining in the Pocket may not always have been founded on logic
                    but their choice has proved to be a sagacious one. When the "terrible trees" were
                    grubbed out with backbreaking labor, the earth was found to be extremely fertile, the soil deep and
                    rich, producing wonderful crops of corn and wheat, while its treasures of oil and coal lay still
                    concealed beneath its surface. The <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the <geogName>White River</geogName> were of inestimable value as highways while the
                    county was still a trackless jungle; they were not obstacles but roads. In fact, the county seat, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was thriving while as yet there were few roads. The records of Jones and
                    Stockwell's store show the customers there in the first quarter of the century included
                    many who came from <placeName>

                    now just a very nice town like many others, though still yearning to Ise a big commercial and
                    manufacturing city. Perhaps if the first settlers in the Pocket could have been aware of how it
                    would turn out, they would not grieve too much. A home was what they wanted, and though they were
                    confident of their ability to build a state far superior to any that Europe could show, they were
                    hard-headed and expected no miracles. The experience that most of them had had elsewhere in America
                    had prepared them for the hard work that would be their portion in developing their new lands. In
                    this they had a great advantage over the foreigners who came direct from the old countries,
                    expecting an Eldorado. Their ability to look facts in the face and yet keep their ideals is
                    exemplified in this letter written by Fordham, who would have made a good Hoosier if he had
                    remained. "The <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> is not generally a picturesque object. It
                    addresses itself powerfully to the imagination, but not to the senses. Its banks are clothed with
                    dark forests. Here and there a small cabin peeps from the trees. Sometimes the rocks rise around you
                    in solemnity and gloom—but at one place only, at the falls, do your eyes glance over any
                    expanse of country.</p>
            <p>"Nevertheless, I am more happy, more self-satisfied, on the banks of the <placeName>

                    emotions. They are the fields of enterprise, the cradle of freedom, the land of rest to the weary,
                    the place of refuge to the oppressed. Every sound that issues from the woods, from the crashing
                    tornado which rushes across entire regions, clothed in sheets of fire and shaking the hills to their
                    foundations,—to the soft low murmur of an autumnal breeze,—all excites the
                    most profound sentiments of adoration for the divine author of Nature,—all recall to man
                    the uncertain duration of his existence; but these thoughts are unmixed with aught that can debase
                    his worth or circumscribe his powers. These wildernesses are given to him alone: in them he is free;
                    owning no master but his God, and no authority but that of reason and truth."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

            <head>Honoring a Long-standing Contributor: Julie LeClerc Knox</head>
            <p>At this fifty-year mark in the life of the Indiana Magazine of History, it is especially appropriate
                    that we acknowledge the contribution made to this publication over many years by Julie LeClerc Knox,
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Miss Knox is known to many readers of the Magazine through her articles, the
                    first of which, "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName>," appearing in September, 1915, reflects her lifelong interest in the history
                    of her native <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Directly descended from the Dufour family who founded the town in 1802, she is the
                    great-granddaughter of Madame Antoinette Dufour Morerod, sister of the Dufour brothers. She says
                    that she grew up in a bewildering tangle of kin, imbibing more or less unconsciously her family
                    history. That family history is a colorful one; Miss Knox's father was of Scotch-Irish
                    extraction, and her mother of French-Swiss. Through a great-grandfather born in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Down County</region>, <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
               </placeName>, who was
                    later a scout in the American Revolution, she is a member of the D.A.R.</p>
            <p>A graduate of Vevay High School, Miss Knox taught first in the grades of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then became assistant principal and later principal of the high school. During this
                    time she attended Indiana University, mostly in the summer terms and by correspondence; in 1918 she
                    received the A.B. degree, majoring in English and minoring in Latin and French. She has also had
                    postgraduate work at Columbia University.</p>
            <p>Dr. L. N. Hines invited her to Crawfordsville High School, where she was head of the Latin department
                    for eighteen years, during the last few of which she served as critic Latin teacher of Wabash
                    College. For several years she was district chairman of the Latin activities. For some time her
                    pupils annually published one of the first Latin magazines in the state, and due to it she was
                    invited to address the classical section of the State Teachers' Meeting, and later was
                    elected president of that body.</p>
            <p>Julie LeClerc Knox says that she has written for publication since she can remember. When she was
                    quite young a cousin ran a newspaper and encouraged her by printing her writings. Although Miss Knox
                    explains that he did this "no <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-051-1-066"/> doubt as he was short of
                    copy," it is more likely that even at an early age she displayed the facility for writing
                    that has kept her busy and successful at the craft all her life. She has continued to write
                    regularly for the local papers. Under the persuasion of Logan Esarey and the encouragement of James
                    A. Woodburn, whom she remembers with affection, she began writing historical articles for the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> As a member of the Creative Group of the
                    Crawfordsville Branch of the A. A. U. W. she was stimulated to try to write verse. Some of it was
                    published in anthologies and under the pen name of her great-grandmother Antoinette, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, she received recognition in the columns of Hoosier Homespun of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> and made new friends through her character sketches and verse. She has been
                    more or less a contributor to that column since it was organized.</p>
            <p>A member of Poet's Corner, Inc., since its organization, she has entered the poetry contest
                    every year but one, and has had an impressive record of prize-winning: she has taken first prize
                    every time in the division in which her contribution was entered, except the first time, when she
                    received a second. Last year she was awarded a gold medal in the national contest for her article on
                    "My Choice of Poets." The preceding year she was one of five to tie for a first
                    prize in the national contest for a prose description of the "Home of a Great
                    Poet." She chose Abbotsford, which she had visited.</p>
            <p>Miss Knox is the author of <hi rend="i">The Dufour Saga: 1796-1942</hi>, published in 1942, the story
                    of the eight Dufours who came from <placeName>

            <p>This handsome volume is an impressive attempt to assess the historical accuracy of the Walam Olum or
                    Red Score, a document composed of pictographs and an explanatory text in Lenape (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>) words. The contributors to this study—Eli Lilly, C. F. Voegelin, Erminie
                    Voegelin, Joe E. Pierce, Paul Weer, Glenn A. Black, and Georg K. Neumann—regard the
                    pictographs and accompanying songs as "the tribal story from the Creation to the coming of
                    the White man to North America. The main themes are the migration from Asia to Alaska and south and
                    east across the North American continent, and the chronological presentation of the chiefs by which
                    time was measured in the epic." The significance of the Walam Olum to students of Indiana
                    history is that such documentation as is available indicates that "the original painted
                    records are reported to have been found in Indiana …" (p. 250). The results
                    published in this volume are a permanent record of the investigations by a coordinated and competent
                    group. Future research can build on the work accomplished so far and will not have to repeat the
                    tasks recorded here.</p>
            <p>Publications of translations and interpretations of the Walam Olum have appeared in the past. The
                    first, in 1836, was the work of Constantine S. Rafinesque, and the volume under review reproduces
                    the manuscript of this author from the original in the possession of the Brinton Memorial Library of
                    the University Museum, University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. This excellent reproduction is in itself a valuable contribution, since the Rafinesque
                    manuscript appears to be the only source of information on the Walam Olum. The second publication
                    was by Ephraim G. Squier in 1848, with subsequent inclusion of his paper in volumes of collected
                    papers on Indian subjects. In 1885 Daniel G. Brinton made a more complete study of the Walam Olum
                    and his account has been the standard up to the present.</p>
            <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-051-1-070"/>
            <p>It is the virtue of this volume that a much more comprehensive and intensive study has been made than
                    was done in the 1800's. Eli Lilly has contributed a painstaking examination of the symbols
                    of the Walam Olum for internal consistency, for comparison with native American pictographs and
                    petroglyphs, and similar symbols in other early picture writing. His interpretations are ingenious
                    and strongly indicate a connection between the pictographs and the accompanying text.</p>
            <p>Carl F. Voegelin has contributed a new translation of the words recorded as explanatory of the glyphs
                    which seems to differ from the Brinton and Rafinesque versions, but an accompanying explanation of
                    the differences is lacking. Perhaps the discrepancies were the result of Voegelin's
                    preference for his recent field work, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> dictionary that he compiled, and the understanding of modern informants of words
                    written down 125 years ago as a basis for translation. However, the linguistic interpretation as a
                    phase of the Walam Olum is beyond my competence to evaluate, and I gladly leave the problem to other
                    students.</p>
            <p>The running commentary by Erminie Voegelin on the translation of the songs provides possible
                    interpretations of the historical and cultural significance. It is unfortunately true that the Walam
                    Olum in itself offers extremely little precise geographical information, and it is not too clear to
                    the reviewer whether the happenings recorded in the several books form a continuous sequence.
                    Certainly there are very few references to material culture, social organization or mythological
                    beliefs from which could have been formed a more adequate comparative picture. The comments are of
                    interest but one wonders if it might not have been possible to find more connections with historical
                    and modern accounts of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> life. The suggested movements of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> in the comments on Book V provide a picture of an extremely mobile group whose
                    wanderings covered a rather large area from Indiana to the Atlantic and from at least <geogName>Lake
                        Erie</geogName> on the north to south of the Mason-Dixon line, within Lilly's suggested
                    chronology from about 1145 A.D. to the 1600's. I shall return to this in the discussion of
                    Glenn A. Black's chapter.</p>
            <p>I view Paul Weer's chapter on the "History of the Manuscript and Painted
                    Record" as an excellent presentation <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-051-1-071"/> of his energetic
                    and conscientious search for historically verifiable evidence regarding the acquisition of the
                    painted record by Rafinesque and the poems or songs which he published with the pictographs. It is
                    an interesting and important record and is presented in a clear and constrained tone. His
                    conclusions are as follows: "We have presented rather strong circumstantial evidence, and
                    suggested a motive for a Dr. Ward being on <geogName>White River</geogName> in Indiana in 1820. We
                    have failed to find any facts to elaborate Rafinesque's statement that he acquired the
                    Walam Olum material in 1822, except to show that his travels for that year were within a restricted
                    area wherein dwelt a Dr. Ward." In Rafinesque's account of this acquisition of the
                    Walam Olum he states that the "actual Olum [painted glyphs on wood or bark] were at first
                    obtained in 1820, as a reward for a medical cure, deemed a curiosity; and were unexplicable. In 1822
                    were obtained from another individual the songs annexed thereto in the original language; but no one
                    could be found by me able to translate them." However, the version recorded by Rafinesque
                    on his manuscript is "This Mpt. and the wooden original was procured in 1822 in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but was inexplicable till deep study of the Linape enabled me to translate them with
                    explanations. (Dr. Ward)" Apparently "Dr. Ward" obtained
                    "… some of the original Wallum-Olum (painted record) of the Linape tribe of
                    Wapahani or <geogName>White River</geogName>," and transmitted these to Rafinesque. But who
                    was "another individual" who provided for Rafinesque in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> the accompanying songs? Rafinesque provides no data on this vital point of
                    "another individual" who would know the songs to accompany the pictographs, could
                    provide the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> words that corresponded to the glyphs so that Rafinesque could record them with his
                    drawings, but who could also not give him in English any inkling of the meaning of the Indian words.
                    Another feature of Weer's phase of the work is the suggestion that in the considerable
                    archives at Moravian College there may be manuscript data which will be of value in understanding
                    the origin and meaning of the Walam Olum.</p>
            <p>Lilly has contributed a stimulating chapter, "Speculations on the Chronology of the Walam
                    Olum and Migration of the Lenape." This might have been placed at the end of the volume as
                    an interpretative summation of the investigations <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-051-1-072"/> of the Indiana
                    Historical Society team. The thesis is presented that the Walam Olum can be viewed as a native
                    historical account which documents the movement of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> (or perhaps the Algonkians as a group) from their early Siberian home across Bering
                    Strait about 366 A.D. According to the Walam Olum account, the ancestral <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> proceeded up the Yukon after the Bering Strait passage and crossed the divide to the
                    east side of the Canadian Rockies. From here they migrated southward to a point between the
                    headwaters of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Mackenzie where one group turned east to become the northern Algonkians, while
                    the second group advanced in a southeasterly direction to "<geogName>Snow
                    Mountain</geogName>" in southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName> which they reached about 808 A.D. The second group then moved southeastward into the
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>, crossing the <geogName>Mississippi</geogName> and
                        <geogName>Illinois rivers</geogName> and occupying the southern Indiana-southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> area about 1136 to 1300 A.D. From there they crossed the Alleghenies about 1327 into
                    eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                    </placeName>. The time scale is based on the number of chiefs mentioned in the Walam Olum and an
                    averaged 13.67 years as the reasonable tenure period for each chief. The route is based on
                    interpretations as to the geographical location of the vague references to landscape features,
                    neighboring Indian group names, and to some degree on other anthropological data. The picto-map on
                    the front flyleaf has a rather curious presentation of the relationship of Bering Strait to the
                    mouth of the Yukon. Lilly has this to say about this series of speculations. "The most
                    intriguing question in connection with the Walam Olum is how much of it is reasonably accurate
                    history and how much mere romance. Both are undoubtedly present. … While results thus far
                    have not been conclusive, and not always encouraging, such studies should not be discontinued until
                    the truths and falsities of this interesting tradition are finally determined." With this
                    we can fully concur.</p>
            <p>Glenn A. Black had the difficult task of assimilating a considerable body of archaeological data from
                    the Middle West and the East. Much of this is unpublished and there are unfortunate areal gaps.
                    Furthermore, as is apparent from his bibliography, he did not have our present knowledge of a fairly
                    large number of radiocarbon dates for the area concerned. At the present time (November, 1954) <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-051-1-073"/> many archaeologists have accepted a beginning date for the
                    Woodland culture around 2000 to 1000 B.C., while the climax of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> culture seems to be of the order of 2000 years ago. Even without radiocarbon dates,
                    some archaeologists by cross-correlating <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> materials into the
                    Southwest were suggesting a date for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the order of 1500 years ago. This is important because Black suggests the
                    possibility of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> as the pre-historic group responsible for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> culture in the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>, and the time of their occupancy would
                    be around 1100 to 1300 A. D., according to Lilly's estimates. These latter dates are
                    actually the ones which the majority of archaeologists accepted in the late 1930's and
                    early 1940's. I seriously question that the archaeological evidence in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> eastern locations indicates that a migration took place from the <geogName>Ohio
                    Valley</geogName> to eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> for any or all of the three tribal groups which came to be called <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> well along in the historic period. My interpretation would be that the prehistoric
                    materials in the area of the Munsee, Unami, and Unalachtigo represent separate and distinctive
                    prehistoric cultures which could not be brought together in a single archaeological culture in past
                    time.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Woodland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> materials in the central and northern Plains have been consistently interpreted by
                    archaeologists as a westward expansion from the Upper <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> and
                    the same thing is true of the Wood-land from the southern Canadian plains where it is known to be
                    late and both Siouan and Algonkian. This is the re-verse of the situation required in the present
                    interpretation of the Walam Olum. I do not believe the archaeological evidence supports the
                    migration story of the Walam Olum.</p>
            <p>There is much that is valuable in Black's chapter. He effectively documents the difficulty
                    of identification from early historic documents and maps of specific archaeological sites and
                    cultures. He presents a summary and suggests a correlation of the prehistoric Delaware traits of
                    "Lenape" with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> occupation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and of "Talligew" (a group mentioned in the Walam Olum) with the
                    Adena culture. Black is by no means dogmatic in this chapter, and, while I am skeptical of the
                    implication of many of his questions, I respect the cultural evidence which <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-051-1-074"/> he has used to show connections between archaeological groups.</p>
            <p>Neumann's chapter deals with the skeletal material attributed to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> and the evidence it offers for pre-historic <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> movements and origins. Neumann's chapter was the last to be submitted, and his
                    interpretations have, I think, benefited from data not available to other contributors. He believes
                    that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> in late pre-historic times in the east belonged to a relatively homogeneous physical
                    division of the American Indians which he calls Otamid. This physical type is of considerable
                    antiquity in the New World and a similar physical type also has considerable antiquity in
                    northeastern Asia. It is also the physical type of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> culture in the Middle West. We do not know, however, if the physical type of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> times in the historic <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> area was Otamid, although that would be a reasonable guess. Since the Otamids were in
                    the Northeast, according to Neumann, in the Early Wood-land period, the possibility is open that the
                    historic <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> could have been descended from that early Otamid population in the Northeast and was
                    not necessarily an east-ward extension during <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> or later times.</p>
            <p>One interesting result of Neumann's work is that the prehistoric population to which he
                    assigned the term Lenapid he no longer believes to be the physical remains of the Lenape. Perhaps a
                    change of name would make things less confusing.</p>
            <p>I have long been intrigued with the probable Asiatic origins of some of the Woodland culture traits.
                    As a result of a year's study in Europe on northern Eurasian prehistory, I am more than
                    ever impressed with the cultural similarities in prehistoric times between Northeast Asia and the
                    Woodland area of eastern North America. There are, however, considerable difficulties in the simple
                    thesis that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> or the Algonkians migrated from the Minusinsk-Baikal area to the <geogName>Mississippi
                        Valley</geogName> carrying Woodland culture with them.</p>
            <p>There are relatively few of the inevitable errata. On pages 351 and <hi rend="i">364</hi> the
                    reference to Hrdlicka's "Crania of Siberia" should be Volume XXIX, and
                    not XIX, of the <hi rend="i">American Journal of Physical Anthropology</hi>. On page 365
                    Tolstoy's title should be "Some Amerasian Pottery Traits in North Asian
                    Prehistory." On page 369 Mrs. Lafferty's <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-051-1-075"/>
                    account of the connection between Rafinesque and Dr. Ward is curiously reversed, for here it says,
                    "See page 51 for undocumented account of transfer of Walam Olum from Rafinesque to
                    Ward."</p>
            <p>This study of the Walam Olum is a stimulating attempt to validate the historical accuracy of a
                    migration legend attributed to the Lenape. I believe that it has not been successful because of
                    chronological conflicts between the legend and the archaeological data; because the archaeological
                    data can be interpreted in a number of different ways and the "truth" is not yet
                    apparent, and because the physical anthropological data is also open to a variety of
                    interpretations. Current linguistic attempts at providing a relative time scale for large language
                    families in the New World also indicate a much greater time depth for Algonkian in North America
                    than Lilly's speculations would allow.</p>
            <p>This monograph and this review are a reflection of the present status of the interpretation of
                    eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    it is not always likely that any student, or group of students, will be wholly right or wholly
                    wrong. This volume is a significant contribution, and the effort which has gone into it will have
                    and has had many interesting by-products.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A History of the Southern Confederacy</hi>. By Clement Eaton. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>: The Macmillan Company, 1954, pp. ix, 351. Index. $5.50.)</head>
            <p>This compact, scholarly, judicious history of the South during its great struggle fills a place all
                    its own. "I have sought to achieve a balance between the social, political, and military
                    history of the Southern Confederacy," writes Dr. Eaton, and in this he has been successful.
                    Whereas Robert Selph Henry's <hi rend="i">The Story of the Confederacy</hi> is primarily a
                    military narrative, and E. M. Coulter's <hi rend="i">The Confederate States of America</hi>
                    is most important for its socio-economic materials, Dr. Eaton's work blends all the
                    elements of the story in just proportions. Built largely on the immense <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-051-1-076"/> amount of monographic work done since 1900, it is an excellent
                    compendium of generally accepted facts and conclusions. It also contains, however, no small amount
                    of fresh research in newspapers, unpublished diaries and memoirs, and letters. The MS Journal of
                    Robert G. H. Kean, for example, sheds light and color on dozens of pages; the letters of Augusta J.
                    Evans are used with almost equal effectiveness. While these materials do not buttress any fresh
                    interpretations or offer any strikingly novel facts, they do give the book originality and carry
                    into its pages a refreshing realism.</p>
            <p>Realism, indeed, is the most striking quality of Eaton's treatment. It is unflinchingly
                    candid and honest. The seamy side of the Confederacy is presented without reservations. Most
                    Southern soldiers, he writes, did not know for what they were fighting. This was just as well; for
                    (he says) their struggle was in one aspect simply a refusal of the South to accept modern change and
                    live in the nineteenth century. He is frank about the caste system in Southern society and the gap
                    it often opened between officers and men in the army. Not merely does he restate the familiar
                    verdicts on Jefferson Davis' difficulties of temper, Toombs's and
                    Stephens' sulking, the incompetence of James Mason abroad, the selfishness of Joseph E.
                    Brown and Zeb Vance, and the blunders of Pemberton and Bragg. He dares to say that many Southern
                    girls were vulgar, illiterate slatterns; that Southern armies (like Northern) had almost countless
                    skulkers and deserters; that the South finally experienced a most unheroic loss of morale. Slavery
                    to Dr. Eaton is an ugly institution, and he bluntly asserts that "the vast majority of
                    field slaves became disloyal when the Federal armies approached."</p>
            <p>Eaton's gift for condensed utterance is remarkable. He has compressed into 300 pages what
                    many historians would require 600 to say, and his compression means no loss of precision. Every
                    subject is given us in a nutshell, from chaplains to the traits of generals, from diplomacy to
                    medicines, from prisons to the strategy of great battles. Necessarily, his treatment is more largely
                    topical than narrative. In not a few instances we wish that the author had allowed himself more
                    room. His discussion of Confederate diplomacy, for example, while in the main perfectly adequate,
                    suffers from the fact that he does not have space to take a broad view of European complications
                    1861-65. Inevitably, <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-051-1-077"/> also, the compression, and the topical
                    organization of the book, squeeze out of it most of that color, sparkle, and narrative suspense for
                    which general readers now look in any book on the war. The vitality of history resides to a great
                    extent in detail and in story-telling, and for neither of these does Dr. Eaton have elbow space. His
                    style also suffers from compression, for while clear and weighty, it lacks richness, humor, and
                    literary grace. But it should be added that he has a keen eye for telling quotations, from the very
                    characteristic utterance of a Mississippi college boy in 1861, "I cannot study and I wish
                    to join a horse company," to the profound observation of Howell Cobb near the end of the
                    war: "If slaves will make good soldiers, then our whole theory of slavery is
                    wrong."</p>
            <p>While every chapter is good, the best are those for which Eaton himself lays claim to special
                    originality: on logistics, strategy, and Western campaigns. For both North and South, military and
                    industrial organization in wartime, and the provisioning, equipping, and transport of troops have
                    been egregiously neglected. James Ford Rhodes mentions munitions but once in his history. The
                    chapter on "Soldiers in Gray" is also well done, while that on Southern culture,
                    though sometimes degenerating into a mere enumeration of titles of newspapers, books, songs, poems,
                    and translations, furnishes a more impressive account of the subject than that of any other
                    historian. Throughout the book, it is both a strength and a weakness of Dr. Eaton that he is almost
                    entirely factual. Those who wish an objective treatment will like his strict adherence to what is
                    proved or provable. Others, however, will wish he had done much more to present his personal views
                    and interpretations. His book would have gained not merely in interest, but in depth and energy. The
                    chapter in which he comes nearest to providing personal interpretation is that on "The Loss
                    of the Will to Fight," and it therefore has qualities lacking elsewhere.</p>
            <p>We may well be grateful to Dr. Eaton for so able, thorough, and balanced a summation of the subject.
                    A similar book on the Northern side of the conflict is much needed. Many of us will regret that he
                    did not emerge from his studies with a set of strong personal views, a philosophic point of view,
                    and did not put more interpretive power into his work. We may also regret that he did not allow
                    himself an extra <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-051-1-078"/> hundred pages for more narrative and
                    portraiture. But he has admirably achieved what he set out to accomplish, and has given us a history
                    which, if never moving or exciting, is thoughtful, learned, accurate, and complete.</p>

                    that time candidate for Governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> on the Democratic ticket. Except for one or two brief interludes, Miss Stiles was to
                    remain with Howe until his death and with the Democratic party, in one capacity or another, until
                    the present day.</p>
            <p>No one will deny that Miss Stiles has had unparalleled opportunities to observe Louis Howe in action,
                    and through his eyes, Franklin D. Roosevelt. There is nothing particularly new about Roosevelt in
                    this book. Since no man has been written about so extensively this is not to be wondered at. But it
                    comes as something of a surprise to one who saw Louis Howe in his role of personal manager to
                    Roosevelt, that he ever was a little boy, or even that he had a wife and children. That he came of
                    Yankee stock was, I believe, taken for granted: but this reviewer was surprised to learn that he was
                    born a Hoosier—even though one of our most cherished traditions is that men who excel in
                    politics are born some-where in the vicinity of the <placeName>

                    atmosphere the young Louis grew to manhood.</p>
            <p>In the Gay Nineties and the early 1900's, Saratoga was the mecca for the idle rich who came
                    to "take the waters," <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-051-1-079"/> Somewhat later it came
                    to be the resort for horsemen, speculators and politicians. As a child young Louis Howe was
                    associated with his father in the newspaper business. Before long, the frail and studious young man
                    earned fame as a reviewer of books and as a political reporter. In the winter of 1907, he was

                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Howe's first hero was Governor Charles Evans Hughes who was waging a vigorous
                    and successful battle against the corporation lobbyists. This young man not only had a penchant for
                    siding with those who were destined to enjoy fame as champions of the people, but he also had a nose
                    for news and was soon recognized as one of the most ingenious and resourceful reporters in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> state. When he learned in 1910 that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dutchess County</region>
                    </placeName>, the private fief of Lou Payne, one of Thomas C. Platt's lieutenants, had sent
                    a Democrat named Roosevelt to the senate, he pricked up his ears. Though a Democrat, Louis Howe,
                    like his father, was an admirer of Teddy and he wondered if the new Roosevelt would carry on the
                    tradition that had made the name of Roosevelt a name to conjure with in progressive households
                    throughout the nation.</p>
            <p>Everyone knows how Franklin D. Roosevelt led a little group of insurgents and forced the withdrawal
                    of "Blue-eyed Billy" Sheehan, Charles F. Murphy's hand-picked candidate
                    for the United States Senate—and thereby earned the enmity of the organization and the
                    love of the independents. Faithfully reporting the events, Louis Howe finally was directed to
                    interview Roosevelt. It was during this meeting that Louis Howe made his decision that the young
                    senator should be President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The rest of the book is a chronicle of the association between Roosevelt and Howe. From this time
                    forward the two were inseparable. Howe followed Roosevelt to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> when the latter was chosen Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Skillful, shrewd and
                    utterly devoted to his leader, Howe superintended Roosevelt's every move, watched his mail,
                    screened his callers, and conducted private campaigns by letter and by news story to keep his hero
                    in the spotlight. When the Squire of Hyde Park was stricken with infantile <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-051-1-080"/> paralysis it was Howe who stepped in as nurse, valet, counsellor and
                    friend. Indefatigably he strove to maintain morale in the Roosevelt household, and when
                    Franklin's spirits were low, he buoyed him up with activity and hope.</p>
            <p>Historians will quarrel over the role played by Howe in guiding Roosevelt through the 1924
                    convention, when the latter nominated Al Smith in a ringing speech which helped to heal the breach
                    with Tammany. Also, there will not be complete agreement over the significance of Howe's
                    advice in Roosevelt's decision to run for Governor in 1928. That Howe bent every effort to
                    achieve Roosevelt's success in the Empire State, which Smith lost, is probably accepted.
                    The Governor himself undoubtedly charted the course which kept the majority of the Democrats
                    appeased even when he belatedly stiffened in his attitude toward Mayor James Walker, who had tried
                    the patience of the independent Democrats in the city beyond endurance.</p>
            <p>Certainly Franklin Roosevelt could not have won the nomination in 1932 without James A.
                    Farley's help and he could not have won the election if the depression had not faced Hoover
                    with more problems than he could solve. Miss Stiles does not exaggerate Howe's service to
                    the President during the hundred days when Roosevelt was tackling the problems of recovery and
                    relief. Nor does she attach undue importance to the contributions which Louis Howe made to the
                    "reform" movement known as the New Deal. But she faithfully portrays Louis Howe as
                    the faithful, selfless guardian of the master's private life, the political bureaucrat and
                    tactician, the friendly antagonist who restrained the erratic and some-times perilously close to
                    disastrous impulses which were characteristic of Roosevelt. After Howe's death, no other
                    man ever attained to the position of intimacy which he enjoyed with Roosevelt for twenty-six years.
                    Of course, Roosevelt went on to win the 1936 election in a landslide, and twice more was to capture
                    the nomination and win the election. Although Louis Howe had slept away, he had left his friend with
                    a keener sense of responsibility and a vital faith in his destiny which survived the passing of the
                    gnomelike little man from Saratoga.</p>
            <p>This is not a tale told by a psychologist. But in this faithful chronicle of events we see how
                    necessary to the Great Man. the Leader. is the loyal, inspired and unambitious <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-051-1-081"/> comrade. That such a man as Howe happened along when he could be of
                    most help to the future President is one of the accidents of history. It is not enough to say that a
                    leader of Roosevelt's "type" attracts such lieutenants. The lieutenant
                    has to be there to be attracted.</p>

            <p>Two caveats will strike the reader of this well-written volume. The publisher's dust-cover
                    refers to the "first assessment of a controversial career," and on page vii the
                    author says his work is "intended more to raise questions than to give final answers, many
                    of which are not yet available, and some of which may never be." Other assessments there
                    will inevitably be; the author's answers are perhaps more categorical than his tentative
                    statement just quoted might portend.</p>
            <p>Family, training, and association prepared Henry Lewis Stimson for public service. Scion of New
                    Yorkers just below the first-line aristocrats but still with a long tradition, he went naturally
                    enough to Phillips-Andover, to Yale, and to the Harvard Law School, whence his connections took him
                    into Elihu Root's law firm. Here he acquired enough of this world's goods to free
                    him for such public duties as came his way.</p>
            <p>These were many; calling the roll in a brief 250 pages is no mean feat of compression. Appointed to a
                    federal district attorneyship by Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, Stimson became an enthusiastic
                    trust-buster. As enthusiastically, but less successfully, he ran for governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> in 1910, finding haven as William Howard Taft's Secretary of War in 1911.
                    World War I gave him some military experience and the rank of colonel. His real contribution to
                    affairs began at the age of sixty with service as proconsul of waning American imperialism in <placeName>
                        <country reg="nq">Nicaragua</country>
                    </placeName> and the Philippines. He returned from the latter to his first association with
                    high-level policy making as Herbert Hoover's Secretary of State. <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-051-1-082"/> Retiring thence into a sort of emeritus elder-statesman role, he at
                    first counselled and supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and then became estranged by the
                    latter's overactivity in domestic affairs and the supineness of his foreign policy.
                    Rooseveltian political exigencies produced his third cabinet assignment, this time as Secretary of
                    War, in 1940. Continuing for a time under Harry S. Truman, he finally mustered out in 1945.</p>
            <p>Few biographers draw their subjects fully fair. Current's portrait shows plenty of
                    imperfections, few of which are minimized. Stimson emerges as a crusty, rather stuffy individual,
                    with aristocratic ideas ill-suited to the times, operating ably within a rather narrow ideological
                    framework, and never troubled by the need for consistency. This tendency to reverse himself becomes,
                    indeed, one of Current's chief grievances against his subject, with what justification each
                    reader must judge for himself. To this one it seemed that, rather than indicating mere
                    spinelessness, Stimson's shifts might be at least partially explained by his relation to
                    responsibility, whether he was speaking with the private citizen's freedom, or acting under
                    orders as the instrument of another's policy; moreover, the possibility of change as a
                    function of increasing maturity may deserve more than the author's casual acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>Culling a few major episodes, we find added documentation of the deep cleavage, both of motive and of
                    means, between Hoover and Stimson on Manchuria, the latter trying repeatedly and unavailingly to
                    persuade his chief to condone sanctions against Japanese aggression; the Secretary here developed a
                    pattern which Franklin D. Roosevelt used more positively. Current strikes a good balance between the
                    contributions of each to the nonrecognition doctrine which has hitherto been chiefly called after
                    Stimson. As Secretary of War he plunged into the controversial aspects of policy now being refought
                    in the pages of historian and propagandist. Somewhat more restrained than the all-out revisionists,
                    Current absolves him of the charge of conniving at the deliberate provocation of a Japanese attack
                    in the "how we should maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot"
                    passage of the diary. He shows that, since American leadership expected the overt act to be
                    committed against the Dutch or British, the problem of "maneuver" was one of <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-051-1-083"/> creating a situation in which such a blow would appear to be
                    also an attack upon the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>One exculpation, however, leads to another accusation, as Current assigns to Stimson at least his
                    share of the blame for insufficient alertness to the possibility of Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor;
                    later, too, he sought to avoid and shift responsibility for this disaster to other shoulders. The
                    account of two other aspects of wartime policy leave him in an unfavorable light. His was the chief
                    responsibility, under the urging of west-coast hysteria largely inspired by pressure-groups, for the
                    decision that "military necessity" justified the evacuation and virtual
                    imprisonment, in violation of normal canons of civil liberty, of thousands of Japanese-Americans.
                    Again, and perhaps in the long run this will be his heaviest responsibility, he played his last
                    crucial role, in the face of conflicting scientific advice, in the decision to loose atomic power on
                    all-but-prostrate <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>This is a controversial book. The author accepted the risk of those who write close to the event,
                    before the documentation necessary to a full appraisal has become available. It is the
                    reviewer's belief, however, that some aspects of Stimson's career, such as
                    Nicaragua and the Secretaryship of State, would have been better described after a closer
                    examination of already available printed and archival material. Current's highly-critical
                    evaluation, though not the first such appraisal (see the works of A. Whitney Griswold and Sara R.
                    Smith) renders him liable to a suspicion of having written from a hostile predisposition. This
                    leaves him a target, some-what vulnerable, for subsequent scholars whose predispositions may be less
                    or different, and whose materials will be more voluminous. Out of this give-and-take will, one day,
                    emerge a rounded portrait. Meantime, this "first assessment" merits close
                    attention, if not universal agreement, for its content, its point of view, and its lively
                    presentation.</p>

            <p>The author seems to see something reprehensible in the Yankee "cultural
                    imperialism," which attempted to impose Yankee morals, Yankee "book
                    larnin'," Yankee thrift, grass culture, dairying and cheese making, mince pie, and
                    down-east dialect on the earlier Southern-western tradition. Is he willing to extend the same
                    implied condemnation to American cultural imperialism elsewhere in the world and at a later
                    date—even to Point Four programs? The Yankees in this period were sometimes irritatingly
                    egotistical and looked upon the upland Southern settlers in the West as ignorant and godless because
                    they differed so much in manners and mores from the <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> norm. But it seems clear enough that these Yankees often had plenty of
                    "know-how" in education, in improved agricultural methods, in journal-ism, and in
                    business to share with a society which had more than its share who were illiterate, improvident,
                    and, occasionally, downright lazy.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, too, the Southerners looked down upon the Yankees, giving measure for measure for Yankee
                    scorn and criticism. The Yankees tended to organize wherever they went and whatever they
                    did—and keep records of it. The uplander who came along the
                    "Jinglety-bang" trail was an extreme individualist and his incursion into the
                    Northwest was not organized in a "crusade to extend Southern culture." It was not
                    in the Southern genius to do so. The Yankee migrant usually carried with him a love of the cultural
                    institutions which he left behind him, and certainly hoped to recreate in the West some of the
                    institutions of the East, but <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-051-1-085"/> some of the Southern uplanders
                    were essentially refugees from the social conditions of the South. It was hardly to be expected that
                    they would have a quite comparable missionary zeal.</p>
            <p>The author has made excellent use of various original sources, including the often-neglected papers
                    of the American Home Missionary Society. There are several useful maps, including a map of the area
                    "dependent on cooperative drainage" and a good general map of the chief routes of
                    migration.</p>
            <p>He thinks that there was produced in the West, in the Corn Belt area, a culture which was neither
                    Yankee nor Southern but truly Western, a culture created in large part by western environmental
                    conditions, especially by the corn-hog cycle and the sense of natural abundance which he finds
                    chiefly demonstrated by the fact and the folklore of the mid-western cornfields. Whether the
                    continuing differences between Yankees and Southerners in the West have been more important than
                    differences between the culture of the sea-board area and of Transappalachia is a matter of emphasis
                    and somewhat of local patriotism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Planting Corn Belt Culture</hi> explains in part why the frontier theme is still a
                    living thing to students of local social and institutional history in this country and is likely to

            <p>During the span of years covered by this careful study, the American people may be accurately
                    characterized as a society in motion. When independence was achieved there were some four millions
                    of people scattered along the Atlantic seaboard, few of them living out of easy reach of tidewater.
                    The 1850's saw all of middle America occupied by a population sufficient to add seventeen
                    new states to the original thirteen. This great movement of people westward was primarily concerned
                    with laying economic and political foundations and gave little attention to the things of the
                    spirit. Under such conditions, to use the words of Horace Bushnell, barbarism was the first danger.
                    Schools and churches did <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-051-1-086"/> not spring automatically out of
                    frontier soil, nor were they transplanted as a matter of course. It was the leaders of the American
                    churches who were most aware of the dangers lurking in this situation. These years also have
                    significance in that they witnessed the formation of numerous agencies for the uplift and
                    reformation of American society on a vast scale. Among these agencies were numerous Bible and Tract
                    societies which sent out their agents by the thousands; the Sunday School Union which founded their
                    schools in numberless communities; the Temperance Societies, and other idealistic organizations
                    advocating better treatment of the poor, penal reform, women's rights, and anti-slavery
                    societies. It was indeed an era of organized reform. The thesis of this study is that these many
                    uplift movements either directly or indirectly stemmed from the evangelistic emphasis in the
                    revivalistic churches, under the leadership of an extremely able, dynamic and colorful group of
                    evangelists, mainly made up of New School Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Methodists, and
                    Baptists.</p>
            <p>Chapter two is an enlightening appraisal of eleven of the principal revivalists of the time and the
                    nature of their contribution. Among them are Asahel Nettleton, Lyman Beecher, Peter Cartwright,
                    Horace Bushnell, and Charles G. Finney, whom the author considers the most able of them all. Chapter
                    three is an appraisal of the social and moral changes resulting from the efforts of the evangelists
                    to remold society, together with the contributions made by a group of wealthy laymen, most of whom
                    were New School Presbyterians. This group would include the Tappan brothers, wealthy merchants of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>; Gerrit Smith, wealthy landowner of up-state <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the friend of every good cause; Anson Phelps, manufacturer, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, a devout supporter of numberless good causes; and William Jay, emancipation and peace
                    advocate and an Episcopalian. Not a few of the evangelists not only advocated moral reforms, but
                    participated in politics and did not hesitate to bring politics into the pulpit.</p>
            <p>By 1860 the evangelists found themselves out of step with the time, but most of them were not aware
                    of the fact. They were all theological conservatives and the public press was inclined to ridicule
                    their meetings and methods. But the author concludes that in spite of the fact that "their
                    philosophy, <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-051-1-087"/> their methods, and their programs were
                    rejected," they left behind a heritage for those who were to come after them.</p>

               </hi>. By Hermann Hagedorn. (<placeName>

                    </placeName>: The Macmillan Company, 1954, pp. 435. Illustrations and index. $5.00.)</head>
            <p>This book is not another political biography of Theodore Roosevelt or of his family. Instead it is
                    mainly an account of the personal life of the Roosevelts, of their day-to-day existence, of their
                    relations with one another and with their friends, and of their private triumphs and tragedies.
                    Theodore Roosevelt, of course, holds the center of the stage, but public affairs are introduced
                    usually only when necessary to provide the setting of the family history. Since the author probably
                    knows more about the personal life of the Roosevelt family than any other American writer, the book
                    makes a certain contribution to American biography. A more detailed picture of Mrs. Roosevelt is
                    given here than in any other work, as well as of the children when they were young.</p>
            <p>During his early college days the author of this book, Hermann Hagedorn, seized upon Theodore
                    Roosevelt as his chief hero. In some nine books written about Roosevelt and his family over the next
                    fifty years, he has kept his youthful loyalty unimpaired. Hagedorn is at present executive director
                    of the Theodore Roosevelt Association. This book is not critical, nor does it introduce jarring
                    notes of uncertainty about the motives or actions of its characters. Evidence which points in such
                    directions is ignored. Consequently, it is not history, nor was it meant to be. Rather it is a last
                    act in a lifetime romance.</p>
            <p>Taken in the spirit in which it was written, this volume is an excellent one. In public or in
                    private, Theodore Roosevelt just could not be dull. The eternal adolescent in him made an adventure
                    out of the smallest things. Whether digging for corruption in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> or for clams on the Long Island beach with his boys, the very air around him was full
                    of excitement. He loved both life and youth with an enduring intensity, and he imparted his feelings
                    to those <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-051-1-088"/> close to him. Moreover, there was a rare and almost
                    unmatched warmth in Roosevelt's relations with his family, which the author has caught.
                    Well written and full of interesting details, this volume will delight practically everyone
                    interested in an unabashed admiring account of one of America's most colorful and prominent
                    families.</p>

            <p>The academic historian is likely to approach Gerald Carson's <hi rend="i">The Old Country
                        Store</hi> with skepticism if, before reading it, he has taken note of its somewhat
                    loose-jointed style and the author's background as an advertising executive. What, he might
                    ask, could possibly be added to the story of this peculiarly American institution as related so well
                    in several other works, among them Professor Thomas D. Clark's <hi rend="i">Pills,
                        Petticoats, and Plows</hi>. If these doubts still exist 300 pages later, however, the reader
                    must be either totally lacking in imagination or unreasonably demanding.</p>
            <p>This reviewer was pleasantly surprised to find <hi rend="i">The Old Country Store</hi> both
                    historically sound and extremely entertaining. But it is more than interesting economic and social
                    history. What might appear at first glance to be a casual assemblage of random anecdotes and factual
                    data is in reality a mirror of everyday life in much of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of the nineteenth century. By his deft focusing of this literary looking-glass, Carson
                    has caught the flavor and atmosphere of the country store as our forebears knew it and at the same
                    time he has placed it in its proper historical perspective.</p>
            <p>Carson's professional experience inspired his interest in the general store and stimulated a
                    quest for knowledge that led him to libraries, museums, and out-of-the-way communities. During his
                    years as vice-president of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> &amp; Bowles, Inc., and later of Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, Inc., while he was
                    promoting automobiles, cereals, and soaps, he was also attracting attention with his articles on
                    business, advertising, and historical subjects. The avocation finally gained the upper hand and he
                    retired from the business world to devote his <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-051-1-089"/> time to writing.
                    The number and variety of books, professional journals, periodicals, and manuscripts cited in the
                    appendix and the chapter references are indicative of the extensive research performed by the author
                    in preparing the present volume. In addition, he interviewed many old store-keepers and descendants
                    of others, and studied the contents of country store replicas in various museums. His attention was
                    centered largely upon the northeastern and north central states, thus neatly complementing
                    Clark's study of the south-ern general store.</p>
            <p>The author designates the year 1791 as the beginning date for the development of the merchandising
                    system that produced the country store. The adoption of Alexander Hamilton's proposals for
                    a stable financial system encouraged men of moderate means to open small stores with more assurance
                    of success than during the preceding decade. As the frontier pushed westward, the merchant followed
                    and set up shop, often in a one-room log cabin. In these isolated settlements the general store
                    reached full flower. It eventually became not merely good business but a virtual necessity for the
                    storekeeper to dispense, along with certain foodstuffs, such varied items as hardware, shoes,
                    clothing, drugs, jewelry, dry goods, crockery, books, candy, and tobacco. Moreover, he usually
                    served as postmaster and legal and medical adviser to the community. In the early nineteenth
                    century, with the scarcity of money and the inadequate transportation facilities, it was inevitable
                    that the barter system found wide favor. In addition, much business was transacted on credit,
                    forcing the storekeeper to toil laboriously over his ledger in the hope that he might persuade his
                    customers to settle their accounts at least once a year.</p>
            <p>Before long the primitive roads were being trod by itinerant peddlers who became familiar figures in
                    rural areas. The appearance of one of these traveling vendors at a farm house was usually the signal
                    for the family to gather round to gaze longingly at the wonders revealed as the peddler unrolled his
                    pack. As soon as the roads and his financial circumstances permitted, the peddler bought a horse and
                    wagon and carried a larger stock of merchandise over a greater area.</p>
            <p>By the 1850's it had become common practice for the rustic storekeeper to don his Sunday
                    suit and journey to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-051-1-090"/> York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> once or twice a year. There he enjoyed the pleasures of the metropolis while selecting
                    new clothing styles and other stock for his store back home. There he was also ex-posed to the
                    "drummers of Pearl Street," the high pressure salesmen who wined and dined the
                    visiting merchant and swindled him out of his bankroll if the opportunity presented itself.</p>
            <p>This phase in the saga of the country storekeeper began to fade away with the westward extension of
                    the railroad. After the Civil War, Americans in far-flung towns and hamlets were introduced with
                    growing frequency to the sight of the commercial tourist or the drummer on the road. This was the
                    original traveling salesman whose exploits have long been the subject of ribald humor. He usually
                    arrived in town with a flourish and attracted a crowd on his way to the general store where he held
                    forth with a rapid-fire patter of jokes and the latest news from up and down the line, and finally
                    made his play for the storekeeper's business. Frequently the merchant was so charmed by the
                    persuasive manner of the drummer that he ordered more crockery, tobacco, or what-have-you than he
                    could sell in a year. There were two types of commercials, the fly-by-night agent for new inventions
                    and specialties and the more honest representatives of wholesale houses interested in gaining their
                    customers' good will and repeat orders. From the latter group came many who later rose to
                    prominence in business, among them Marshall Field, Aaron Montgomery Ward, and King C. Gillette.
                    Theirs was a glamorous occupation in a romantic era but it was not an easy life for a man, being on
                    the road for months at a time, sleeping in second-rate hotels and boarding-houses, and facing
                    strenuous competition at every turn.</p>
            <p>The decline and ultimate demise, for all practical purposes, of the country store were attributable
                    to two innovations, the mail-order house and the automobile. The famous catalogs of Sears, Roebuck
                    and of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> Ward offered a variety of merchandise that the rural merchant could never hope to
                    match, and on liberal credit terms, as well. The automobile, on the other hand, brought the farmer
                    and his family into closer contact with cities miles away. Nearly everyone wanted an auto for it
                    pointed the way to an entirely different mode of living. As one farm wife, whose family had a Ford
                    but no bathtub, put it, "You can't go to town in a <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-051-1-091"/> bathtub." By 1921 the transition was virtually complete and
                    the country store had become little more than a memory.</p>
            <p>So skillfully does Carson recreate the atmosphere of the general store that the reader has no

                    exchanged stories and munched crackers from a nearby barrel while they wrinkled their noses at the

                    Frances Trollope, Harriet Martineau, and Frederika Bremer, which have long been familiar to American
                    readers, is now added <hi rend="i">A Half Year in the New World</hi> by Alexandra Gripenberg. The
                    book, which appeared in 1889 and 1891 in Swedish and Finnish editions respectively, has recently
                    been translated into English and edited by Ernest J. Moyne.</p>
            <p>Alexandra Gripenberg, member of a distinguished Swedish-Finnish family, was the author of several
                    other books and a leader in securing the emancipation of Finnish women. The present book is in the
                    form of random recollections of her travels and observations during a six months tour of the <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-051-1-092"/>

                    </placeName> in 1888. She came to this country as a delegate to the International Council of Women,
                    which met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington, D.C.</settlement>
                    </placeName> Her book contains an enthusiastic account of this convention, with sketches of such
                    prominent feminists as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and May Wright Sewall.
                    Next to the women's rights movement the author showed the greatest interest in American
                    literature and literary figures, a subject about which she displayed considerable knowledge and
                    appreciation. She visited several literary shrines and met a number of writers. Chapters in the book
                    are devoted to such diverse literary figures as Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain, and Joaquin
                    Miller. She was fascinated too by some of the new religious movements and made inquiries into
                    Spiritualism, Christian Science, and Mormonism.</p>
            <p>During her visit she travelled across the entire continent, observing many varied aspects of the
                    American scene. In her book she sought to cover many other subjects, ranging from politics to the
                    natural wonders of Niagara and Yosemite. Among the more entertaining parts is an account of
                    conditions of railroad travel which she encountered on a trip from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where she attended a meeting of the National Education Association.</p>
            <p>The author showed less understanding of American history and politics than of some other subjects.
                    Although she attended the Republican National Convention of 1888 the complexities of American
                    politics baffled her. Her account of the differences between the Republican and Democratic parties
                    was an over-simplification, to say the least. She also made some egregious errors regarding history,
                    as when she represented the Fourteenth Amendment as a cause of the Civil War.</p>
            <p>She visited settlements of her Finnish compatriots in <placeName>

                    </placeName> but found little to commend in their way of life (possibly because they retained their
                    native fondness for strong drink, while she was a temperance advocate). On the other hand her
                    attitude toward Americans and American institutions was generally sympathetic and frequently
                    admiring. She had warm praise for American family life and especially for the liberty and esteem
                    enjoyed by American women.</p>
            <p>Alexandra Gripenberg's account is not so penetrating <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-051-1-093"/> as
                    the works of some other European visitors, but neither is it so biased as some others. Its
                    publication adds an enjoyable item to the social history of the late nineteenth century.</p>

                    </placeName>: Louisiana State University Press, 1954, pp. viii, 537. Illustrations, bibliography,
                    and index. $6.00.)</head>
            <p>This very interesting biography by Joseph Parks deals with a Confederate general for whom no real
                    biography has been previously attempted. In many ways Kirby Smith was one of the most dramatic as
                    well as controversial figures of this trying period in the development of American democracy.
                    Obviously a lost cause is productive of controversial figures. Those who lead victorious armies, or
                    their component parts, are more likely to be glorified, than censured for mistakes. The Kirby Smith
                    who helped turn the tide for the South in the first battle of Manassas and who spear-headed what
                    might have proved a successful Southern invasion of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and of the West found his star dimming when he faced the problems, as general in
                    command, of that portion of the Confederacy known as the Trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. This was particularly true after the surrender of Vicksburg cut the Confederacy in two
                    and isolated that area.</p>
            <p>Kirby Smith was a native Floridian whose roots were deep in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> soil. Like many other natives of the area north of the Mason-Dixon line, his parents
                    had transplanted themselves to a southern state and came to love it, even though memories of
                    childhood persisted.</p>
            <p>In addition to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> background this particular Smith family had an army background, which made them, as it
                    were, to the manner born. This means that Kirby Smith had a number of army connections as well as
                    friends of various degrees of intimacy who were in some large measure helpful in forwarding his
                    career in the Army.</p>
            <p>Like many other West Pointers of his day, General Kirby Smith received his baptism of fire, in his
                    training for the War for Southern Independence, in the Mexican War where he gave a good account of
                    himself and emerged as a breveted <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-051-1-094"/> captain. Following his Mexican
                    War service Smith had a rather long period of service on the Western plains in Indian wars or
                    near-Indian wars.</p>
            <p>As Parks interestingly explains, Kirby Smith aligned himself with the Southern cause rather readily
                    and most of his family joined him. However, the author notes the fact that Smith continued loyal to
                    the Union, even to the extent of refusing to surrender Camp Colorado to Confederate demands, and
                    until he had resigned his commission in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army. Like many of his fellow army officers, once the die was cast, his advancement was
                    rapid in the Con-federate Army to the extent that when the fighting began he had reached a
                    brigadier-generalship. This advancement continued, culminating when President Jefferson Davis, one
                    of his old friends, made him a full general.</p>
            <p>As Parks carries Kirby Smith through the vicissitudes of his career as a Confederate leader, he aptly
                    notes Smith's conflicts with other commanders and his consequent poor opinion of some of
                    them. Of those who did not meet his approval we find Generals Robert E. Lee and Braxton Bragg, and
                    particularly Bragg, who failed to follow through on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> invasion. Later events obviously justified his appraisal of Bragg. His difficulties
                    with subordinate generals in the Trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> were undoubtedly aggravated by problems of supply and by his own status of command, cut
                    off as he was from the central command of the Confederacy in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Parks does not hesitate to suggest some of Smith's own failings as he dealt
                    with these problems.</p>
            <p>It is noteworthy that our author gives us phases of Kirby Smith's life that add color to his
                    biography. These have to do with Smith's cultural interests as exemplified by those things
                    that appealed to him as he travelled through Europe in 1858, a few years before the War, and
                    particularly in the thrill that he found in the art and cultural centers of the Old World. This side
                    of his life is further indicated by his interests in botany and kindred subjects. Parks gives
                    further touches that help to explain Smith's character: the pleasant relations that the
                    young Army officer had with the Mexican population, the understanding and appreciation that
                    persisted between him and his former friends who were officers in the Union Army, his attitude
                    toward his own family slaves and negroes generally, and his deep religious convictions,</p>
            <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-051-1-095"/>
            <p>Not much fault can be found with Parks' appraisal of Kirby Smith. He perhaps gets caught up
                    in the intricacies of Smith's handling of the cotton business in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> and his attempt to use it as a source of monetary supply. Perhaps the greatest
                    disappointment to the reader will come from the short space given to the quarter of a century of
                    Kirby Smith's life after the surrender of his Trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Army. Like many of his fellow officers of the Confederacy, General Kirby Smith rendered
                    one of his greatest services to the Southland on the college campus. There, like General Robert E.
                    Lee, he taught the young manhood of the South loyalty to a reunited country and an enthusiasm for
                    serving that country. The stature of Kirby Smith grew on the mountain top at the University of the
                    South, better known as Sewanee. It is of further interest to note that in his native <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> the chief monuments to Kirby Smith are the Kirby Smith School in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Kirby Smith School in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gainesville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the University City.</p>
            <p>One may well wish that Parks had made somewhat greater use of official records to which he had
                    access. He leaned somewhat too heavily on family papers but these undoubtedly added spice to his
                    narrative. Errors seem to be few and largely excusable, such as a footnote on the bottom of page 115
                    when the date should be 1861 instead of 1860. The author leaves us somewhat up in the air as to what
                    became of 26,000 stand of small arms which were badly needed by General Kirby Smith's Trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Army. We lose these arms on page 352 and they do not show up again.</p>
            <p>On the whole, Parks has made a notable contribution to the Southern Biography Series, started and
                    developed by Fred C. Cole and Wendell H. Stevenson in the best tradition of excellent scholarship.</p>

                    </placeName>. The city may have been, as Sherwood Anderson said, the scene of only a
                    "robin's egg renaissance," but it was fertile and genuine, however
                    short-lived, and there was nothing else like it in the nation. From 1890 to 1926 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the creative nexus for scores of writers, from such well known figures as Anderson,
                    Edgar Lee Masters, Vachel Lindsay, and Carl Sandburg, to such forgotten but once noted authors as
                    Robert Herrick and Henry Fuller. The flowering of the Renaissance in the second decade of the
                    twentieth century saw the founding of <hi rend="i">Poetry</hi> magazine, the <hi rend="i">Little
                        Review</hi>, and the lively Chicago Little Theatre, while the <hi rend="i">Friday Literary

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Daily News</hi> became outlets for vigorous critical writing. The Renaissance had
                    cosmopolitan breadth; it was "the first characteristic modern instance in which American
                    literary romanticism met Europe." Finally, Professor Duffey asserts, the Renaissance first
                    defined the anti-materialist, anti-business rationale that is the vital heritage of modern American
                    writers. The waters of the <geogName>Chicago River</geogName> formed a somewhat muddy Pierian spring
                    that is still flowing.</p>
            <p>Duffey observes, however, that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> phenomenon was not a "rebirth" but the "working out within
                    the city of creative forces common to the nation at that time." In the first phase, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> writers, like other American writers, were attempting to free themselves from the
                    rose-petal shackles of a diffuse romanticism and outworn idealism—the "genteel
                    tradition." <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s upper class strivings for culture, the casting of pearls before swine, were
                    reflected in the novels of Henry Fuller and Hamlin Garland's later work. Yet despite
                    genuine achievements, the precursors of the Renaissance failed of fulfillment. Because the
                    city's upward movement lacked the solid social foundation it needed, the genteel tradition
                    there as elsewhere faded off in a delicate sunset of "taste."</p>
            <p>It was superseded by the more vital forces of realism. Although realism had had earlier Midwestern
                    representatives in Edward Eggleston and E. W. Howe, William Dean Duffey sees it in the Renaissance
                    as stemming primarily from William <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-051-1-097"/> Dean Howells and from its
                    European practitioners, and attracting undisciplined writers like Theodore Dreiser because it
                    enabled them to capitalize on mere experience without the pain of developing imagination and style.
                    And despite the reportorial accuracy of "critical realists" like Will Payne and I.
                    K. Friedman, who used their novels as ethical lances to attack the brutality of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, their writings remained superficial. Herrick in a few of his novels achieved a more
                    enduring form of muckraking which still fell short of tragic perception.</p>
            <p>The climactic phase Duffey calls the "Liberation." The new "assertively
                    liberated bohemians" had in common with the genteel writers and the critical realists the
                    protest against the industrial world's crushing materialism, but the earlier writers were
                    motivated by the spirit of uplift, the liberators by the spirit of rebellion. It was the liberators
                    who produced the bulk of what Duffey suggests is the best literature of the Renaissance: <hi rend="i">
                  <geogName>Spoon River</geogName> Anthology</hi>, Sandburg's <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi>, Anderson's finest prose. He mentions, too, Lindsay's mystical poetry and a
                    couple of Floyd Dell's novels. Yet even the major figures of the Renaissance had careers
                    which were in some essential way unfulfilled. The basic cause, Duffey indicates, was their failure
                    to discipline the Midwestern romanticism to which they fell heir.</p>
            <p>Duffey has succeeded in a difficult project: anatomizing a whole sprawling corpus of literature and
                    laying bare its complex relationships. His ability as a social historian is demonstrated, for
                    example, in his skill at perceiving the function of the city and its class structure in shaping the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> writer and his literary product. Here he strikes a nice balance between assessing the
                    strength of environment and the writer's own character. His biographical sketches, though
                    rather colorless, center unerringly on the critical influences upon a writer, and always with a
                    sharp eye to his writing.</p>
            <p>Duffey is likewise distinguished as a critic, when he permits himself to be one. His insights are
                    subtle, his judgments sound. His book lacks the high surface interest of, say, Van Wyck
                    Brooks's studies in cultural history, but it is critical history in a sense that
                    Brooks's are not. Duffey comes close to Vernon Parrington in acute analyses of social and
                    political forces, but he is, quite properly, far more concerned with <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-051-1-098"/> literature than Parrington was. Far from imposing a single political
                    idea as his literary canon, Duffey never makes it quite clear just what his whole canon is, though
                    one gathers that for him ideas and good intentions are no substitute for literature: depth,
                    sensitivity, imagination, a cultivated style, a sense of tragedy are needed. But he is silent on the
                    question of the rightness of the whole course of the Renaissance in aligning itself against the
                    dominant ethos of the business community, and at the end he is only tentative about the ultimate
                    value of the best work of the Renaissance, rather curiously rejecting the final act of criticism. It
                    is, of course, true, as Duffey says, that "Great room is needed for individual
                    perceptions," but it is precisely the lack of these which is the major shortcoming of his
                    book. It is not only that he usually gives a clearer picture of the limitations of his writers than
                    he does of their merits, and that he allots seventeen pages to Henry Fuller and thirteen to
                    Sandburg, but that one may read the essay on Lindsay, for instance, without getting much
                    understanding of any other aspect of his poetry than his mysticism. Yet Duffey's more
                    extended analysis of <hi rend="i">
                  <geogName>Spoon River</geogName> Anthology</hi> is so penetrating
                    that one wishes that the same courtesies had been extended to other significant works. The thinness
                    of the literary criticism is not altogether compensated for by its strength and its stylistic
                    sensitivity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Chicago Renaissance in American Letters</hi>, is not, then, the definitive study of
                    the period. Duffey's bibliography notes time and again the need for research in certain
                    areas. But until the secondary materials are available for the literary historian, or until some
                    scholar has the patience and the means to produce them himself, Duffey's study will offer
                    values rare for initial investigations of this scope. And in some ways it will be very difficult to
                    equal it.</p>

            <p>The Genealogy Division of the Indiana State Library has recently acquired a set of the 1850 census of
                    population schedules of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> on microfilm. The set covers all counties and comprises twenty rolls of film. This is a
                    valuable addition to the Library's growing collection of microfilmed records. For several
                    years Indiana census records from 1840 through 1880 for all counties have been available in the
                    Library on film, while the censuses of 1820 and 1830 are represented by photostat volumes.</p>
            <p>In cooperation with the Indianapolis Public Library the Indiana State Library has had vital records,
                    which include wills, marriages, probate records, and deed indexes, microfilmed in about one-half of
                    the counties of the state. The oldest counties have been given preference in this project, but it is
                    the Library's ambitious hope that eventually records from the entire state may be preserved
                    on microfilm.</p>
