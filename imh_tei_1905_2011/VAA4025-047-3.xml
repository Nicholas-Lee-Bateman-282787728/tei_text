            <head>Some Projects in Midwest Cultural History</head>
            <byline>John T. Flanagan∗</byline>
            <p>When young Lincoln Steffens entered the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> as a student, he flung himself with energy and optimism into the pursuit of truth. But
                    he soon discovered that not only was truth elusive and protean but knowledge itself was deceptive
                    and insecure. The social sciences were only beginning to show some objective validity, the physical
                    sciences constantly required revision and codification, the arts aspired nobly to a perfection which
                    they never quite reached. To Steffens, eager for reliable and final answers, the situation was
                    perplexing. "Nothing is done," he cried out in exasperation, "Everything
                    in the world remains to be done or done over."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the student of the cultural history of the Middle West is not precisely in Steffens'
                    predicament, he too is constantly aware of uninvestigated areas of life, unsolved problems,
                    unwritten biographies, and unpublished records. Despite a spate of articles, monographs, and books
                    in the last fifty years, with the literary record constantly amplifying and ramifying, the picture
                    is still considerably short of complete. Indeed much remains to be done, or in Steffens'
                    words to be done over, before any kind of valid synthesis can be achieved.</p>
            <p>It is neither courteous nor intelligent, of course, to overlook the solid accomplishments of the
                    immediate past. The literary historian thinks at once of Ralph L. Rusk's monumental volumes
                    entitled <hi rend="i">The Literature of the Middle Western Frontier</hi>, and every student of the
                    development of the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">The Old Northwest.</hi> Both authors, unfortunately, saw fit to make 1840 their
                    terminal date. An older writer, William H. Venable, produced a fascinating personal chronicle of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> school in his <hi rend="i">Beginnings of Literary Culture in the <geogName>Ohio
                        Valley</geogName>
               </hi>, although modern readers find it uncritical and factually unreliable.
                    Dorothy A. Dondore's <hi rend="i">The Prairie and the Making of Middle America</hi> is
                    comprehensive and useful but its very inclusiveness blurs its focus. Harlan Hatcher and Walter
                    Havighurst have fused political, economic, and social history in several books, and Philip D.
                    Jordan's <hi rend="i">National Road</hi> illustrates admirably the impact of a great
                    western turnpike on time, place, and manners. Of the many volumes devoted to the lake regions and
                    river valleys of the Middle West none is more charming than James M. Phalen's <hi rend="i">Sinnissippi</hi>, the story of the Rock River of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Biographies, of course, are numerous and varied. Without pausing to enumerate the studies of
                    soldiers, clergymen, and politicians, one might observe that biographical studies have been written
                    about such literary figures as Timothy Flint, James Hall, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, Edward Eggleston,
                    Finley Peter Dunne, Eugene Field, James Whitcomb Riley, George Ade, Theodore Dreiser, and William
                    Allen White. Excellent bibliographies of such significant midwest authors as Ade and Riley have been
                    compiled. The documents of particular cultural centers like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> have been made available. Special monographs on the theatrical history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Davenport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> have been published, and critical studies of the work of such painters as George Caleb
                    Bingham and John Steuart Curry have been written. Above all, the cultural historian owes a
                    conspicuous debt to the historical societies of the various midwest states and to the hospitable
                    policy of the editors of the quarterlies sponsored by these societies. For these journals have not
                    held to a narrow conception of what history is but have published articles ranging in theme from
                    publishing, education, and domestic life to accounts of literary and debating societies and
                    chronicles of circuses and showboats.</p>
            <p>But one remembers the bold assertions of Hamlin Garland in 1894. In a neglected little volume
                    entitled <hi rend="i">Crumbling Idols</hi> he sought to establish his creed of veritism; he argued
                    sincerely and persuasively for local color and for genuine use of the materials which an author knew
                    best even though they <pb n="243" id="VAA4025-047-3-007"/> might include alleys and backyards. But
                    even more to the point, Garland observed that midwest writers and artists in general were ignoring
                    the possibilities of the life around them. Themes were crying out for treatment, he asserted, and he
                    enumerated a few: the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>, the life of the Great Lakes region,
                    the areas dominated by segments of foreign population, the epic of lumbering, the growth and impact
                    of the railroads, the rise of towns and cities in his native Middle West. It is true that in this
                    inventory Garland was thinking largely of creative activity, of poets and novelists who would employ
                    such materials in great literature, of sculptors and painters who would mold durable works of art.
                    But unfortunately neither artists nor scholars have taken the challenge seriously enough to provide
                    the necessary answers. Although more than half a century has passed since <hi rend="i">Crumbling
                        Idols</hi> appeared, many of Garland's themes remain untouched.</p>
            <p>Certainly the possibilities are enormous. The recent death of Sinclair Lewis reminds us that no one
                    has written a substantial biography of the first American man of letters to win the Nobel Prize for
                    literature. It is inconceivable that Lewis will not eventually inspire a flood of reminiscent and
                    biographical volumes, but the point is that so far they are all in the future. Almost equally
                    paradoxical is the neglect of Hamlin Garland. Admittedly not a major figure in literature, Garland
                    nevertheless occupies a secure place in the history of American realism and certainly his services
                    were important enough to justify a serious study of his work. There is no adequate biography of
                    Sherwood Anderson, despite the thousands of letters to and from Anderson that have found a haven in
                    the Newberry Library; and there is no full-length study of Vachel Lindsay to compensate for some of
                    the distortions inherent in the biography written by Edgar Lee Masters. Masters himself has had no
                    biographical attention at all. Other once prominent writers of the Middle West who have so far
                    eluded competent biographers are Joseph Kirkland, Booth Tarkington, Robert Herrick, Herbert Quick,
                    Floyd Dell, John G. Neihardt, and, Willa Cather.</p>
            <p>To go back a little further, some earlier midwest authors have dropped into such complete obscurity
                    that their personal existence seems almost mythical. Caleb Atwater, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> historian and educator, has never attracted a biographer, nor has William D. Gallagher,
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> journalist who edited <pb n="244" id="VAA4025-047-3-008"/> the <hi rend="i">Hesperian</hi> and in 1841 published the first anthology of midwest poetry. Such early literary
                    figures of the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> as Julia Dumont, Otway Curry, John James Piatt,
                    Emerson Bennett, and Alice Cary have never been honored by substantial monographs. William Morton
                    Payne, once the distinguished editor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Dial</hi>, has so completely lost his identity that the recent <hi rend="i">Literary
                        History of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> confuses him with Will Payne, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> novelist; and Francis Fisher Browne, founder and proprietor of the <hi rend="i">Dial</hi>, is not even listed in the index of the bibliographical volume of that work. There is no
                    study of William T. Coggeshall, editor, novelist, and state librarian of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Maurice Thompson, author of that little gem of early realism, <hi rend="i">Hoosier

                        </placeName>
               </hi>, has been by-passed by biographers, as has the romantic historical novelist
                    Mary Hartwell Catherwood. Alice French, once widely known under the pseudonym of "Octave
                    Thanet," seems quite forgotten. There was no more fascinating personality in American
                    literary journalism than William Marion Reedy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but no biography has been written about the famous editor of the <hi rend="i">Mirror.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Moreover, even those biographies that have appeared have
                    seldom provided satisfactory treatments of all aspects of their subjects. There is room for a study
                    of Eggleston's literary evolution, for an analysis of William Allen White as a writer, for
                    a discussion of the peculiar prairie asceticism of Edgar W. Howe.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes a whole literary period has been neglected to such an extent that the cultural historian
                    faces an almost insuperable obstacle. The <placeName>

                    which convened at the home of Daniel Drake or Samuel E. Foote and which was dominated intellectually
                    by Drake and James Hall. Among its members were Benjamin Drake, E. D. Mansfield, Caroline Hentz,
                    Calvin B. Stowe, and, in later years the most illustrious of the group, the unmarried daughter of
                    Lyman Beecher. Except for Mrs. Stowe these figures excite little attention today. A similar

                        de plumes</hi> as "Straws" and "Everpoint" and created in

                    that it never was to be the future great city of the world, fewer literary lights existed but
                    studies of Alexander DeMenil and Denton J. Snider would be profitable. And certainly the once widely

            <p>But turn from writers themselves to writing and publishing. If great literature seldom emanates from
                    a literary society or club, it is true that such organizations often have a lasting effect on
                    authorship and for that reason alone merit study. The Western Association of Writers, which convened

                    interesting and still active organization. The notorious Whitechapel Club of <placeName>

                    </placeName> claimed all the celebrated newspapermen of the day as its members and sponsored many
                    famous meetings, but its story has been only incompletely revealed in the autobiographies of the
                    journalists who once belonged to it. Such organizations as the Caxton Club, with its bibliophilie
                    traditions, and the Cliff Dwellers, promoted by Hamlin Garland and borrowing a name <pb n="246" id="VAA4025-047-3-010"/> from Henry Fuller's novel, have also played an important but
                    little discussed role in the cultural history of the Middle West.</p>
            <p>Publishing houses themselves have only recently become the subject of investigation, and certainly
                    Sidney Kramer's admirable history of the firm of Stone &amp; Kimball is a step in the
                    right direction. But similar studies are needed of the beginnings of the McClurg firm, of

                    </placeName>, but no one has ever examined the almanacs of the Middle West in order to explain their
                    popularity and to discuss them as reflections of popular taste. Here the uniformity and
                    conventionality of the type should not blind the student to regional variations. Midwest almanacs,
                    unfortunately, are not easily studied as the fancier of the Davy Crockett comic almanacs or the
                    Commodore Rollingpin almanacs of John Henton Carter has ample occasion to know. But even if no
                    midwest library is as rich in this sort of material as the American Antiquarian Society at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Worcester</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it should be possible with reasonable diligence to assemble enough examples.</p>
            <p>There is similar need to investigate the whole field of gazetteers, guidebooks, and
                    traveler's aids which poured from the press before the Civil War and which reveal the
                    prospective immigrants' anxiety about routes, clothes, expenses, equipment, food prices,
                    and land purchasing. Some of these volumes had an amazing longevity. John Kilbourn's <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Gazetteer</hi> went through nine editions in fifteen years, while the various books
                    of John Mason Peck about the <placeName>

                    </placeName> country had a wide circulation and still retain value as sources for the history of the
                    period. From a literary point of view, the most interesting of these guidebooks are those which
                    became on occasion both subjective and dramatic. Peck was not averse to interpolating his own views
                    on temperance and slavery,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> while Alphonso Wetmore appended several interesting
                    realistic sketches to the usual summary of statistical information in his <hi rend="i">Gazetteer of

                    immigrant life despite the fact that they were commonly written in the style and manner of the

            <p>One might indeed hazard the statement that the entire historiography of the Middle West has never
                    been examined for its own sake. Michael Kraus in his study of the writing of American history
                    completely ignores the early midwest historians although he pays ample attention to the Middle West
                    in history and devotes considerable space to such writers as Frederick Jackson Turner, Theodore

                    have generally appeared as articles in historical quarterlies. The itineraries of distinguished
                    eastern lecturers have been traced by students eager to salvage every biographical detail about
                    Emerson, Alcott, Melville, Bayard Taylor, Holmes, and Greeley. But the total view is still hazy and
                    incomplete. The cultural historian needs to know the impact of the lyceum system upon the smaller
                    communities, the number and kind of lectures given, their popular reception, the fees paid, the
                    newspaper reports, the general influence upon the local scene. Before such information can be

                    star and the traveling troupe of thespians were an integral part of midwest life throughout much of
                    the nineteenth century. River towns especially benefited from such visits and were far more likely
                    to see Edwin Forrest, Edwin Booth, William Macready, and Joseph Jefferson in person than their
                    twentieth century counterparts are likely to see John Gielgud or Maurice Evans. The programs were
                    rich and substantial with the plays of Shakespeare often providing the staple offerings but with
                    light comedies, pantomimes, and farces frequently filling out an evening's entertainment.

                    theatrical history is a profitable and fascinating subject to explore.</p>
            <p>Moreover, students attracted by such a research field have tended to emphasize the history of the
                    stage rather than the history of the drama. It is true that dramatic composition has never
                    flourished in the Middle West like other literary forms, largely because of the lack of the
                    necessary mediums of production, but from Augustus Thomas's <hi rend="i">In Mizzoura</hi>
                    and <hi rend="i">The Copperhead</hi> to George Ade's <hi rend="i">The County Chairman</hi>
                    and Zona Gale's <hi rend="i">Miss Lulu Bett</hi> regional drama has been written. Among
                    other interesting midwest dramatists one might list Booth Tarkington, Zoe Akins, E. P. Conkle, and
                    Susan Glas-pell. Their work needs evaluation.</p>
            <p>From the theater it is an easy transition to the showboat and its impact upon the life of the small
                    community. Edna Ferber made good imaginative use of the subject and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> stage seized upon the theatrical possibilities of her novel, but little has been
                    printed about the historical showboats, the plays they produced, the physical difficulties of
                    production, the actors presented, and the audiences catered to and pleased.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    west; the considerable curiosity they excited among the youth of both urban and rural areas is

                    </placeName> and Milwaukee, old-fashioned books generally with the emphasis upon economic and
                    political development and with ample attention paid to distinguished citizens—often with
                    formal portraits and comfortably eulogistic biographies. But most of these volumes are booster books
                    or are examples of luxury publishing which reveal little critical analysis and small understanding
                    of the problems involved. Sociological studies of the bigger midwest cities lag far behind (although
                    of course <placeName>

                        </placeName>
                    </hi>), and adequate cultural studies simply do not exist. Despite the many other subjects for
                    investigation enumerated above, one is tempted to agree with the words of Pargellis: "Good
                    books about cities are the great unwritten things in the Midwest."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But since this article makes no pretense to being exhaustive it is useless to illustrate further. The
                    Middle West is not only a large land mass with tremendous potentiality in industry, food production,
                    civic improvement, and artistic creation; it is also a region with a rich, varied, and significant
                    cultural history. Before any kind of adequate synthesis can be made, before the cultural historian
                    can reach any final judgment, a multitude of paths must be explored.</p>

            <p>In 1933, Ralph B. Flanders in his <hi rend="i">Plantation Slavery in <placeName>

               </hi> pointed out that no satisfactory study of slavery in its several phases
                    existed for a single southern state. It is interesting to note that in that same year Ruth
                    Scarborough published a work on the <hi rend="i">Opposition to Slavery in <placeName>
                            <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>

                            <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> which comes nearer to meeting the need which Flanders noted than does any
                    other one book. But even here there was left much room for further study, and in some other areas
                    the gap to be filled is even larger.</p>
            <p>The study of the institution of slavery—a difficult task at its best—was
                    complicated by the tons of material that were manufactured around the sectional controversy and the
                    political aspects of the institution. This "cold war of sectional apologetics"
                    brought many pieces of propaganda that would have done credit to the Hitlerian idea of racial
                    supremacy and which give a mild tone to the language which the Russians and the Western powers hurl
                    at one another. The truth of the situation was so obscured that only recently have we come to
                    uncover it, and even to get some good works on the cold war itself. There are a few works, however,
                    in this period before the end of the Civil War that have some value for us. James Stirling, James S.
                    Buckingham, Claude Mackay, Frederick L. Olmsted, Nehemiah Adams, Frances A. Kemble, and a few of the
                    other travelers or temporary sojourners contain observations or analyses that are penetrating from
                    the social standpoint, though one must ever be wary of the inaccuracies of reporting then as today.
                    Two of the travel accounts—Charles G. Parsons' <hi rend="i">Inside View of
                        Slavery</hi> and Philo Tower's <hi rend="i">Slavery Unmasked</hi> afford an excellent
                    opportunity for a study in plagiarism of the former by the latter, while Mrs. Mary H.

                        Statistical View of the Condition of the Free and Slave States</hi> seems much less well known
                    than that of Hinton R. Helper, <hi rend="i">The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It</hi>,
                    who published in the following year. Perhaps the best work of this period came in connection with
                    the studies on the law of slavery: Thomas R. R. Cobb, John C. Hurd, George M. Stroud; and the
                    valuable compilation by J. D. B. De Bow: <hi rend="i">Industrial Resources.</hi> One other
                    discriminating study, Daniel R. Hundley's <hi rend="i">Social Relations in Our Southern
                        States</hi> (1860) presents the most accurate picture of the population structure of the South
                    that was published prior to the 1930's. There should also be mentioned here the
                    observations of John William DeForest before the war and during the reconstruction period in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. These analysts saw more than the slaveowners, slaves, and poor white divisions in the
                    South. While the above are the best, the worst was John E. Cairnes, who in his first edition of <hi rend="i">The Slave Power</hi> found five million "mean whites" but lost one
                    million of them for his second printing.</p>
            <p>The works of the decades of the 1860's and the 1870's reveal the hangover of the
                    great drunk of the preceding quarter century: Henry Wilson, Edward A. Pollard, and the others. But
                    in the 1880's three works appear that are less colored by sectional animosities. These were
                    William Still's <hi rend="i">Underground Railroad Records</hi>, George W.

                    rather remarkable work for the period—Williams was a Negro) and in 1889 Jeffrey R.

                    which may be called the beginning of the scientific history as applied to slavery (even though

               </hi>, had the effect of greatly broadening slavery studies, though some of a
                    considerably later date revert to politics as their main theme. Respectable production increased as
                    the scientific historians—led by James C. Ballagh, John M. Vincent, William Dodd, Ulrich
                    B. Phillips, and Bassett—became more numerous and stress was placed on the publication of
                    documents. Phillips' <hi rend="i">Plantation and Frontier Documents</hi> had a decided
                    effect here, and the three decades of activity were temporarily capstoned by his <hi rend="i">American Negro Slavery</hi> in 1918. The dozen and a half contributions of the 1910 decade were
                    followed by a dozen in the 1920's and by two dozen in the 1930's. In the middle
                    1930's an even broader basis of study was provided through the influence of Frank L.
                    Owsley. This newest approach involves much more digging and laborious research, but gives a more
                    nearly accurate picture of the antebellum period.</p>
            <p>With this very brief account of the trend of the study of the institution, one should turn to see in
                    what fields slavery has been adequately examined and what remains to be done. The relation of the
                    institution to the political fabric of the country has been the subject of more diatribes, polemics,
                    and respectable historical works than any other single phase. Within this orbit, the most widely
                    studied segment (the word studied is used with studied reserve) has been the abolition crusade and
                    the "slave conspiracy." The works of Albert B. Hart, Hilary A. Herbert, Jesse
                    Macy, Gilbert H. Barnes, Dwight L. Dumond, Asa E. Martin, Arthur Y. Lloyd, Alice D. Adams, Justin H.
                    Smith, Eugene C. Barker, Chauncey S. Boucher, Ruth Ketring-Nuermberger, and William S. Jenkins are
                    the main ones; the lesser ones are too numerous to mention. The reorientation of the line of study
                    after the publication of Barnes' <hi rend="i">The Antislavery Impulse, 1830-1844</hi> does
                    not seem to have been as complete as it should have been; at any rate, the newer approach is still
                    foreign to many textbook writers. But even in the political field there has been inadequate study of
                    the colonization movements in the southern <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-047-3-018"/> states, and the
                    thesis that the South shifted to a whole-hearted defense of slavery after 1831 needs further
                    investigation within almost every state. It was unfortunate that most of the literary talent of the
                    South was expended in supporting slavery, but to say that there was suppression of freedom of
                    thought and speech seems unjustified. The climate of opinion may not have been too favorable for
                    these freedoms, but to go much beyond this is dangerous. Too many of the earlier writers, on the
                    abolition crusade particularly, have injected their own moral judgments—generally
                    twentieth century judgments—into their supposedly scientific analyses. This is outside
                    the province of the historian.</p>
            <p>The foreign slave trade has been discussed briefly by several authors and at length by some others in
                    the light of the great inhumanity of it all, but the works of Henry C. Carey, John R. Spears, and W.
                    E. B. DuBois must be listed as contributions. The most comprehensive work here is the set of
                    documents edited by Elizabeth Donnan, <hi rend="i">Documents Illustrative of the History of the
                        Slave Trade to America</hi> (4 volumes), whose introductions to the various parts of her study
                    reveal a better understanding and keener analysis than do the monographs devoted exclusively to a
                    discussion of the trade. The domestic slave trade is still without an accurate unbiased student.
                    Frederic Bancroft's figures are directly traceable to Cairnes, and Cairnes' are
                    only a little more than a decade from the report of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The
                    pseudologic and mental gymnastics that these authors engage in to prove their preconceived ideas
                    leave one with misinformation that is worse than no information at all. It should be added, however,
                    that as long as Bancroft confines himself to the mechanics of the trade, he is sufficiently at home
                    to make a contribution. It is unfortunate that there has been such a constant repetition of the
                    propaganda figures of the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>The existence of the underground railroad doubtless influenced some owners of the border states to
                    sell to the Lower South, though this connection has too often been overlooked by students of the
                    interstate slave trade. This multi-tracked line has received considerable attention in the
                    biographies of several individuals, in reminiscences, and in the works of Still, Wilbur H. Seibert,
                    and William M. Cockrum. In recent years it has had virtually no reworking; its history does not have
                        <pb n="255" id="VAA4025-047-3-019"/> too great a bearing on an understanding of the history of
                    slavery.</p>
            <p>Williams in his <hi rend="i">History of the Negro</hi> in 1882 viewed the underground railroad as the
                    escape valve of slavery, without which he said there could well have been a repetition of the San
                    Dominican trouble. Revolts, or threatened revolts, were naturally of great concern to the
                    slaveowners and to the other members of the southern society. Here, however, a sound study is
                    lacking. William S. Drewry has treated the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> revolts; Joseph C. Carroll dealt principally with the Gabriel, <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName> Vesey, and Nat Turner disturbances, with more than the permissible number of errors;
                    and Herbert Aptheker is so subjective and lacking in discrimination that the book—in any
                    of its forms—scarcely deserves to be classed as history. At any rate, the room for the
                    study is still there.</p>
            <p>Legal prohibitions on assemblage were one of the safeguards against potential revolt and these
                    restrictions tended to curtail religious instruction. Among those who have prepared articles or
                    monographs on some aspect of the slave and religion—or some church and its position on
                    slavery—are Stephen B. Weeks, David Rice, John S. Bassett, Walter Posey, Mary Putnam,
                    Charles Swaney, and Marcus W. Jernegan. The palm must go to Mary Putnam for her work on the Baptists
                    (prepared under William Dodd) and to Charles Swaney for his study on Episcopal Methodism with
                    sidelights on church politics. For the actual workings of the churches among the slaves, especially
                    on the plantations, the only valuable work is that by W. P. Harrison (ed.), <hi rend="i">The Gospel
                        Among the Slaves, a Short Account of Missionary Activities Among the African Slaves of the
                        Southern States</hi> (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1893), which deals with the activities of the Methodists. Apparently, they are the
                    only denomination for which there are any extensive records available. The article, or piece-meal,
                    approach is probably the only possibility of securing a reasonably accurate picture for this part of
                    the mosaic, though it is probable that prohibitions on religious instruction were more honored in
                    the breach than in the observance.</p>
            <p>The status of the slave—according to the letter of the law—was fairly well
                    defined even before the Civil War by such works as Cobb, Hurd, and Stroud. The actual interpretation
                    of these statutes has been put into readily accessible form by Helen T. Catterall's <hi rend="i">Judicial Cases Concerning American Slavery and the Negro</hi>, while Howell M. Henry,
                        <hi rend="i">The Police Control of the Slave in <placeName>

               </hi>, and B. R. Holt, <hi rend="i">The Supreme <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-047-3-020"/>
                        Court of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName> and Slavery</hi>, have made specialized studies on the police control of slaves in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> and on the attitude of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Supreme Court toward the institution. There are still too many writers on slavery who
                    view the statutory position as the actual position of the slave—and would probably be
                    sufficiently naive to say there actually was prohibition from 1919 to 1933; on the other hand, there
                    are others who will not quite go along with Phillips on the idea that the government of slaves was
                    one part by law and ninety-nine parts by men. The legal position can best be studied in relation to
                    slavery in a particular state, for the code was an evolutionary one, determined in large measure by
                    local conditions. One must exclude from the evolutionary process the original <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> code, and, of course, the Code Noir of the early 1700's in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Where the institution has been studied, the legal position has generally been treated
                    with competence.</p>
            <p>The building materials for the over-all study of slavery must be the monographic treatments of the
                    institution within the several states, and it is somewhat discouraging at this date to find several
                    of the more important foundation stones missing. The tobacco kingdom was the first area to receive
                    the attention of the scientific historians, and, in general, is the only area that is yet at all
                    adequately treated.</p>

                    controls, and related topics.</p>

                    articles—though not many—and some documents, but the institution in that

                    </placeName> seems to have been practically "unknown" to the historians. An
                    article or two had appeared before that time, some more in that year, and in 1933 Flanders and
                    Scarborough published their studies. Both are good works, though Flanders is confined to plantation
                    slavery and thus omits a very large part of the slaveholding population from its scope.</p>
            <p>Floridians must glean a meager diet from an article by Wilbur H. Siebert, two by Dorothy Dodd, and
                    the Phillips-Glunt records of the Noble Jones's plantation. The introduction and the notes
                    of the last-mentioned work do prevent the void from being as great as it might first appear.</p>

                    for corollary attention. Davis made extensive use of tax lists, assessors' lists, and other
                    local records, as well as newspapers, planters' records, and the manuscript census
                    schedules. Several of the gaps left by the Davis book have been filled by James B. Sellars, <hi rend="i">Slavery in <placeName>

                    as well as Lewis C. Gray's monumental work on southern agriculture prior to 1860. The
                    achievement of Phillips in 1918 is indeed impressive and his <hi rend="i">Slavery</hi> will not be
                    replaced for many years—if at all. But there is need of continuing the supplementing of
                    this work and of broadening the basis of study. His <hi rend="i">Life and Labor</hi> is more mature
                    than the <hi rend="i">Slavery</hi>; it is broader and more interpretative. Gray disagrees with
                    Phillips on a number of points, but he has assembled and interpreted such an incredible amount of
                    material that his work is far more than the title might suggest.</p>
            <p>Still not all the cotton has been chopped nor all the tobacco suckered, and for the last decade and a
                    half Owsley and his students have been offering "new" or "slightly
                    used" tools for carrying on the work. These implements are a spade, fork, and abacus (or
                    maybe a calculator), and a dogged determination to plow the dirt of the various depositories of
                    local records and to clear a portion of the almost-virgin forests of the federal manuscript
                    censuses. There are sinks and quagmires in these records as in most others, and these
                    "short and simple annals of the poor" are almost incredibly long and complicated,
                    but through them—along with the long-used records—one can come nearer to the
                    true picture of the antebellum South than in any other way. The emphasis is shifted, under this
                    newer program, to a more statistical analysis and to the yeoman group, which was and is the most
                    numerous element of the population. The first fruits of this newer method—articles by the
                    Owsleys, and his <hi rend="i">Plain Folk</hi>, along with the "Notes" by Coles,
                    and the works by Weaver and Clark—attest to the soundness and desirability of continuing
                    on those lines. One must also continue the documentary and semi-documentary studies such as those by
                    E. Merton Coulter, Wendell H. Stephenson, J. Carlyle Sitterson, Edwin A. Davis, and J. H. Easterby
                    (to mention only a few) and, among other things, pursue the study of hired labor (begun by
                    Sitterson), the agricultural reform movement (with articles such as James C. Bonner's), and
                    analyze slavery as an industrial system (in the line of Jernegan).</p>
            <p>It may not be possible, or desirable, to write the <hi rend="i">one</hi> satisfactory book for each
                    state—as Flanders put it—but if the voids indicated are filled by studies
                    carried out along the lines of the most recent ones, the road to an understanding of the true
                    conditions of the antebellum South will be paved with more than good intentions.</p>

            <p>Two hymns and a song were collected by the writer in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the summer of 1935. Both the texts and the tunes of all three were

                    time.</p>
            <p>The hymns were composed and sung by members of the Rappite sect, known also at a later date as
                    Harmonists or Harmonites. The earlier and more common appellation derives from the name of the
                    leader, George Rapp, who founded the sect in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> near the end of the eighteenth century. Because of persecutions there, the sect came to
                    America, settling first in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Butler County</region>, <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, in 1803-1804. In the following year the
                    Rappites founded here the community of Harmony. Five years later the community consisted of one
                    hundred forty families or between seven and eight hundred persons. Here they continued to live until
                    1814, when they sold their holdings and bought land in what was at that time Indiana Territory. At
                    their new home they enlarged their operations in every department of business, cultivated more land,
                    raised more stock, erected larger mills and more extensive factories for the manufacture of woolen
                    and cotton goods, and extended their vineyards and the production of wine. Soon they became the
                    business center for that area. In 1825 they sold their extensive holdings to Robert Owen and removed
                    to <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Even after the death of Rapp in 1847 the Society continued to flourish, but there was
                    a steady decline in membership. In the spring of 1903 all lands belonging to the sect were sold to
                    the Liberty Land Company and the proceeds were divided among the surviving members. On December 5,
                    1905, the Society was dissolved.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <head>The Walam Olum</head>
            <p>The Indiana Historical Society is searching for documentary evidence that Dr. John Russell Ward of
                    Cynthiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, 1816-1829 was a friend and
                    botanical collaborator of Constantine Samuel Rafinesque while the latter was a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and professor of Botany and Natural History at Transylvania (1819-1826).</p>
            <p>Rafinesque, in his <hi rend="i">American Nations</hi> (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1836) published his translations of the now famous Lenape (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>) Indian Walam Olum, believed by some students of American prehistory to be an authentic
                    historical chronicle of the Lenape and significant as the migration narrative of a portion of the
                    great Algonquian Indian linguistic family. The Walam Olum consisted of bundles of sticks or pieces
                    of bark upon which mnemonic ideographs, either incised or painted in red ochre, recalled to the
                    narrators the words of the chronicle as it was passed down from generation to generation.</p>
            <p>Rafinesque reported that the original wooden pieces were obtained from the Lenape living on
                        <geogName>White River</geogName>, Indiana, in the year 1820, by a Dr. Ward, "as a
                    reward for a medical cure deemed a curiosity." Rafinesque acquired the material two years
                    later (1822) in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>; and from another individual a recital of the words to accompany the painted records.
                    His original manuscript transcribing the painted records and the words is in the Brinton Memorial
                    Library, at the University Museum, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In his references to Dr. Ward, Rafinesque gave no identifying initials, no address. Daniel G.
                    Brinton, in his great study of the Walam Olum—<hi rend="i">The Lenape and their
                    legends</hi> (<placeName>

                    </placeName>, Ward family. The Indiana Historical Society has conducted a search for Dr. Ward, and

                    Ward—Dr. John Russell Ward who was found in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName> court records at Cynthiana for the years 1808, 1809 and 1811; and later as a resident

                    </placeName>, Nicholas County, from 1816 to 1829. We also have definite proof that Rafinesque had a
                    botanical friend by the name of Dr. Ward who collected botanical specimens on <geogName>White
                    River</geogName>, Indiana, and <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-047-3-030"/> gave them to Rafinesque in the
                    year 1821. Also, we know that during the summer of 1822, the year Rafinesque acquired the Walam Olum
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Circumstantial, but undocumented, evidence points to the intriguing possibility that
                    Dr. John Russell Ward was Rafinesque's botanical friend through whom the Walam Olum was
                    preserved to enrich our knowledge of the past.</p>
            <p>The actual documentation of this relationship, important as it is in itself, is only a means to the
                    end that side by side with it we hope will be found descriptive references to the Walam Olum and
                    facts concerning the circumstances under which the painted records and the words to accompany them
                    actually passed from the Lenape through Dr. Ward to Rafinesque.</p>
            <p>Is it possible that some reader of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> has old records,
                    letters, manuscripts, Indian "painted records" or anything else relating to 1) Dr.

                                            the Board of Trustees in April, 1854, had provided for personally owned
                                            scholarships or "quietuses." Anyone who paid one hundred
                                            dollars to the treasurer of the University received a certificate
                                            authorizing him to keep one student in the preparatory and academic
                                            departments perpetually and without paying tuition. The quietus was in use

            <p>This work is the result of some thirty years of study and observation on the architectural expression
                    of the people who settled and built the Middle West. It is a connected story of architectural
                    development in the Old Northwest to approximately the period of the Civil War. Professor Newcomb of
                    the College of Fine and Applied Arts of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and Fellow of the American Institute of Architects has studied the records well, both
                    the material records—that is, the buildings which remain—and the documentary
                    material on the subject.</p>
            <p>Early chapters deal with the geographic setting and the people from Indian days to the end of the
                    pioneer period. A brief chapter is devoted to French colonial architecture manifested largely in
                    stockades, forts, residences, and churches. There is a chapter on American architectural
                    precedents— Colonial, Federal, Classical Revival, and on pioneer architectural
                    types—forts, log houses, schools, churches. The Southern influence—bricks,
                    wide central halls, classical frontal porticoes, often two-story galleries—is illustrated
                    by many examples in the southern tier of states in the Old Northwest. The Georgian and Federal
                    types, brought in largely by the <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName>-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> people, and prevailing in the areas settled by them, are also treated. Five chapters
                    are devoted to the Classic Revival as it came into the five states, and one chapter is devoted to
                    the Gothic Revival and its spread westward. One chapter treats of the communal buildings of Shakers,
                    Rappites, Zoarites, Mormons, etc. There is also a glossary of architectural terms used in the text.</p>
            <p>Naturally the buildings discussed and illustrated are the residences of the pioneer aristocracy,
                    churches, public buildings, and the like. The reviewer would have liked at least a brief treatment
                    of the typical homes and business buildings of the people of the region—people who lived
                    in neither log houses nor the more pretentious architectural forms. A few cuts or plates from the
                    more than 300 color drawings of the draftsman-artist Lefevre Cranstone, who was interested in
                    architecture above all things—everything from pigsties to <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-047-3-064"/> cathedrals and government buildings—certainly would not have
                    detracted from the book. But perhaps the most typical of Midwest buildings were not worth
                    consideration from an architectural viewpoint.</p>
            <p>The chapters which deal primarily with historical backgrounds contain numerous minor errors as do
                    several of the maps which delineate the evolution of the state boundaries, notably those on page 58.
                    The Civil War was not "the War between the States," and historians of either the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> or the Old Northwest do not "usually indulge [in] long-drawn-out records of
                    battles" (xvii). Typical of the errors is the statement, page 2, that the Old Northwest
                    "was an unbroken sea of trees." Coming from a citizen of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> this statement sounds particularly interesting, for so scarce were building materials
                    in northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in the pre-railroad era that pine lumber was even brought in from the East and sold at
                    from $60 to $90 per thousand feet. The settlers were advised, if feasible, to
                    bring glazed windowframes, doors, and interior finishing materials with them or purchase same at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>; a few houses were even prefabricated at these points and shipped around to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Territory. The most glaring error is in the title of the book rather than the text; it
                    is not proper to speak of the Northwest Territory in the French period before there was any
                    Northwest Territory, or after 1803 when the Northwest Territory ceased to exist. In the text the
                    region is properly referred to in most instances as the states "of the Old
                    Northwest."</p>
            <p>The chief value of this work, as the reviewer sees it, lies in the fact that the reader is
                    introduced, type by type, state by state, to the architectural heritage of the region. Here are
                    quickly available brief word sketches of the history and architecture of hundreds of
                    buildings—and of the architects, if any; few of importance have been omitted. Numerous
                    sketches and cuts illustrate the text and 96 full-page plates assembled in the rear supplement it.
                    Not only should this book be available to the serious student of the history and culture of the
                    region but it should be available to the unnumbered thousands of persons who have a love for and a
                    general interest in some phase of the history of the Old Northwest—to antique collectors,
                    to the short-trip tourist who likes to know something about what he
                    sees—"There's an old timer; I wonder when it was built and who lived
                    there"—and to high school students. Each and <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-047-3-065"/> every
                    one would find something of interest—and close to home at that. (The reviewer, for
                    instance, was interested to learn that a mausoleum-like Greek structure which he passed thousands of
                    times as a schoolboy was an early showplace residence —none of his teachers ever
                    mentioned that building—and that a farmhouse where his wife played as a girl was a
                    typical Greek Revival of the 1840's. Would that there were some way of putting books such
                    as this in the hands of those who need them most.</p>

                    quarters." With these words John Candler described the conclusion of the first phase of a
                    remarkable abolitionist invasion of the Old South.</p>
            <p>In September, 1853, Candler, Josiah and William Foster, and William Holmes brought to America from
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends, a lengthy document urging the abolition of
                    slavery wherever it might be found. The present volume recounts the trials and tribulations of the
                    mission as it journeyed through twenty-six states and presented its memorial to twenty-three
                    governors and to the President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. At a time when abolitionists were anathema in the South, the four English Quakers
                    called upon the Lord to "help and preserve us," and carried their message to the
                    executive officers of all the southern states except <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>, <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>From beginning to end John Candler faithfully wrote to his wife—"My Beloved
                    Maria"—the series of letters which Miss Thornbrough has edited from a notebook owned by
                    the <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-047-3-066"/> Indiana Historical Society and collated with the originals
                    at Haverford College library. Candler was a widely traveled man who had previously visited the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Portugal, <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, and the West Indies on similar missions. His eye for detail, both geographic and
                    social, was keen even if jaundiced by an ardent missionary fever. The careful minute descriptions of
                    life and travel in the midwestern and southern sections of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> form the most interesting portions of the collection. An estimated ten thousand miles
                    of travel in every type of conveyance from <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName> boats to <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> sleighs gave Candler ample opportunity to test American transportation and to pass a
                    happily restrained judgment upon it. Braving prairie fires in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    </placeName> the travelers gained a unique purview of almost every part of the country.</p>
            <p>The mission itself, particularly its reception by the governors of the various states, seems of
                    secondary importance. As might well be expected, the "Friendly mission" came face
                    to face with politicians like Governor Bigler of <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> who greeted it as disturbing to the peace, rude fellows Price of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> who seemed to threaten bodily harm, and "the Christian Governor"
                    Henry W. Collier of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> whose sincere concern over slavery was in sharp contrast to the "sad
                    sights" exhibited in the Cradle of the Confederacy. Although Candler constantly feared for
                    the personal safety of the mission, he and his fellows were uniformly better received by the
                    governors of the deep South than by any set of officials other than the occasional staunch
                    abolitionists of the North.</p>
            <p>These letters will also prove of interest to the student of American Quakerism for their description
                    of backwoods meetings and careful listing of Friends in all parts of the country. Such material
                    forms a considerable portion of the text, thanks to the widespread earlier American contacts of
                    Candler and his companions.</p>
            <p>As notes and explanatory material have been reduced to a minimum and Miss Thornbrough's
                    twelve-page Introduction includes the four-page Memorial, the letters must stand upon their own
                    merit for the general reader. Candler's style is clear and his matter interesting. The text
                    is unmarred by typographical errors but a few peculiarities of spelling have been perhaps
                    unnecessarily retained. The over-all value of the collection might have been enhanced by some
                    elucidation of <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-047-3-067"/> politics in the nation and the states, or by
                    reference to the reception of the mission in the public press—a matter which concerned
                    Candler himself more than once. Such ommissions detract little however, for as Candler wrote from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "We are here in the midst of … a slavery loving people, and feel
                    the necessity of being very cautious as to what we say… ." The mission had
                    slight political significance and the heart of the letters lies in descriptive passages like that
                    which will appeal to every Hoosier in which Candler rejoices over a sumptuous rural breakfast topped
                    by "a flowing jug of sweet cider unfermented—an excellent drink, and to a
                    thirsty man, delicious."</p>

            <p>No one who has read widely in American records of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries has failed
                    to run across many allusions to the Indians' custom of giving and receiving presents as a
                    fundamental part of their culture. To understand their point of view and act accordingly was the key
                    to success in dealing with Indians. This book is essentially, therefore, a psychological
                    interpretation of French and English attempts to win Indians to their side or to keep the Indians
                    from being lured to the rival side, in the struggle for conquest of the continent. In that contest
                    for empire the English emerged as victors largely because they had more and better presents to
                    bestow on the natives, used them well until 1760, and succeeded to a very considerable extent in
                    keeping the French from getting and distributing the presents they attempted to give to the Indians.
                    After 1760 the victors became niggardly in giving presents, and this parsimony was in no small
                    degree the cause of Pontiac's uprising.</p>
            <p>In a volume of superior manufacture and fine editorial work, the author has contributed sound
                    scholarship, wide reading in both manuscript and printed sources, and clarity of expression. Though
                    the center of attention is presents,—what <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-047-3-068"/> they were
                    and how utilized,—details of personalities and institutions are so rich that a reader
                    cannot fail to learn a large part of American colonial history, both French and English, in reading
                    the book. It would be interesting now to have the author continue his study into the decades beyond
                    1763; report on Robert Rogers' use of presents, the decline of present-giving as Americans
                    took over Indian affairs on the frontier and the relation of presents, or lack of them, to the War
                    of 1812; and pass judgment on the great fur-trading companies in their relation to the "old
                    Indian custom."</p>

            <p>In 1894 twenty years after Sumner's death, Carl Schurz started a biography of his late
                    friend. He produced the partial first draft and rough notes for an essay and later started a second
                    draft which he brought down only to 1861. This second draft has long been in the Library of Congress
                    but the first seemed lost. A few years ago the editor discovered a sizeable collection of Schurz
                    papers in private hands, among them was the lost first draft.</p>
            <p>The essay under review is an editorial arrangement of the two drafts to make as unified a work as
                    possible. The second draft with a few slight changes has been printed and joined to it are the
                    portions of the first draft and notes dealing with Sumner's career after 1861. An
                    informative introduction relates the story of the enterprise.</p>
            <p>Schurz was by temperament and political principles sympathetic with Sumner. Both were reformers of
                    the anti-slavery school and their attitudes toward President Lincoln and Johnson were similar. Both
                    urged Lincoln to free the slaves and both felt Johnson was endangering the Negroes' rights.
                    This same sympathy did not equip Schurz too well to understand some of Sumner's foibles,
                    though all things considered he does remarkably well.</p>
            <p>Sumner emerges as a complex figure, a combination of a genius and a pedant who in turn could dazzle
                    or bore a listener. <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-047-3-069"/> He lacked humor or sensitivity and was
                    extremely vain, yet he was stirred by a desire to improve the lot of mankind and courageous in
                    seeking this end. Despite his imposing physique he was a prey to nervous illness and the beating he
                    got from Preston Brooks probably contributed to his nervous instability. He made loyal friends and
                    bitter enemies. How he succeeded in the former no one seems to make clear. For when he leaves the
                    pens of Schurz and his other biographers he seems always a most unpleasant person, admire his
                    principles and his courage as one must.</p>
            <p>The editor has done a careful and painstaking job but he was limited by Schurz' limitations
                    and by the unfinished state of the work. The value of the essay is the fact that Schurz knew Sumner
                    well and could thus give his work a high degree of validity.</p>

            <p>The most impressive statistic that has come my way in the course of studying the administrative
                    aspects of World War II appeared in a newspaper story which stated that the records created by the
                    federal war agencies alone during the years of conflict would fill a ditch ten feet wide, ten feet
                    deep, and thirty-seven miles long. Fortunately, not all of the records were actually deposited in
                    such a receptacle, but unfortunately they are not all now as accessible as they might have been even
                    in the hypothetical ditch. The fact, to which anyone with the slightest experience in the use of
                    these records can fervently testify, is that the imaginary ditch becomes transcontinental miles of
                    footwork and an incredible variety of depositories when translated into actual research problems.
                    The situation has improved rapidly in recent years with the constant flow of records into the
                    National Archives, but it still remains confusing. The greatest element of confusion, until the
                    publication of the two volumes cited above, was the absence of any sort of guide to this wilderness
                    of paper. Even from the home base of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, navigation remained a trial and error process <hi rend="i">sans</hi> chart or compass.</p>
            <p>The National Archives staff has been concerned with this <pb n="306" id="VAA4025-047-3-070"/> problem
                    since the end of the war and, within the limits of a narrow budget, has been steadily creating order
                    out of chaos. <hi rend="i">Federal Records of World War II</hi> is the ultimate victory in this
                    offensive—a complete guide to the present whereabouts of federal wartime records. The two
                    fat volumes, one devoted to civilian and the other to military agencies, cover not only the
                    completed bodies of records left behind by such strictly wartime entities as the Office of Price
                    Administration and the Combined Chiefs of Staff, but the continuing series of documents created by
                    Congress, the federal courts, the regular administrative offices and the military departments during
                    the war years. Even agencies as apparently remote from war as the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Board on Geographical Names are listed. These volumes are therefore not only a guide to
                    wartime records but to the repositories of contemporary federal records in general.</p>
            <p>The records of 3,057 civilian and military agencies are located by these volumes. Brief histories of
                    each agency with special emphasis on relationships to other agencies precede the records
                    information. Bibliographical notes, citing pertinent books and periodical materials already in
                    print, are appended to nearly every paragraph. A very thorough subject index (covering 219 pages) is
                    furnished. The advantages of this elaborate apparatus of research should be obvious. Let us assume
                    that a student in Indiana wishes to begin a study of "The Role of the War Dog in World War
                    II." Sitting down in any library with these two volumes he can discover by reference to the
                    subject index that he should consult the records of three branches of the Quartermaster Corps and
                    the Veterinary Department of the Army Medical Corps for his source material. The descriptions of the
                    functions of these agencies may suggest connections with other governmental departments which might
                    be followed up. Anything important which had already been written upon his subject would appear in
                    the bibliographies. Finally, these books will reveal that nearly all of the records which our
                    researcher will want to see are deposited in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kansas City</settlement>
                    </placeName> Records Center, AGO. This information might prevent a fruitless journey of six hundred
                    miles in the wrong direction. If <hi rend="i">Federal Records of World War II</hi> also indicated
                    which of these records for security reasons are closed to public inspection it might save our hero
                    an equally profitless expedition in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, this information would be
                    far too complex and too ephemeral to include in anything but a detailed catalogue.</p>
            <pb n="307" id="VAA4025-047-3-071"/>
            <p>It might be added that these volumes under review are not such a catalogue—they are merely
                    signposts pointing to the large depositories of federal documents. Detailed inventories of many of
                    these records, particularly of those already transferred to the National Archives, do exist, at
                    least in typescript, and they will carry the researcher with confidence and accuracy to his final
                    goal.</p>
            <p>In spite of minor faults, (the fact that much of the data, representing as it does the situation as
                    of 1949, was obsolete before it appeared in print—the references in the index to entry
                    rather than page numbers—a tendency toward somewhat ambiguous generalization in the
                    descriptions of records) these volumes add immeasurably to the debt which librarians, historians,
                    government officials, and scholars in all fields owe to the staff of the National Archives.</p>

            <p>As in Europe, the air forces in the Asiatic-Pacific theater were engaged in a wide variety of
                    activities. Reconnaissance, <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-047-3-072"/> supply, maintenance, softening of
                    islands marked for assault, continued neutralization of islands which were by-passed, direct support
                    of ground troops, interference with the enemy's air and naval counter-attacks, antishipping
                    strikes, troop transport, reduction of enemy air power, and successive elimination or capture of
                    Japanese positions partially tell the story of the multitudinous activities of the air arm. The
                    imbalance between Japanese and Allied air forces was gradually reversed and preponderant air
                    superiority belonged to the latter by mid-1944.</p>

                    </placeName>, Guadalcanal Island of the Solomon group offered the last possible opportunity. More
                    than this, global strategy depended on stopping the Japanese offensive. Allied commitment in the
                    Pacific, nevertheless, was to entail "no more than the maintenance of constant pressure on
                    the Japanese foe and retention of the initiative in operations designed to win positions from which
                    a full-scale offensive might be launched immediately after the defeat of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. 131).</p>
            <p>Progress made in evicting the enemy was over " a long and painful road" (p. 204).
                    The battle for Guadalcanal; the victory in the Bismarck Sea action which General MacArthur described
                    after the war as "the decisive aerial engagement" in his theater of operations (p.
                    146); the successful assault and capture of Bougainville, the largest island in the Solomons; and
                    the acquisition of strategic atolls and islands in the Gilbert and Marshall groups prepared the way
                    for destruction of the center of activities at Rabaul, the "keystone of the Bismarck
                    Archipelago." Rather than a costly assault, attainment of air superiority made it possible
                    to effectively neutralize by air attack and then by-pass this long-feared center of enemy power.</p>
            <p>Harry L. Coles' account of the north Pacific campaign clears up the popular misconceptions
                    about the war in that theater. The crucial area was the Aleutian chain of islands, not the mainland
                    of Alaska. Further, the Japanese as well as the American objective in that area was essentially
                    defensive in nature. After a dramatic beginning at Dutch Harbor, activities in that theater tapered
                    off into anticlimax. In the last analysis, "perhaps it was the weather … that
                    relegated the Alaska-Aleutians area to the place of a relatively inactive theater" (p.
                    363).</p>

            <p>Although, generally, the present volume measures favorable with the previous ones in <hi rend="i">The
                        Army Air Forces in World War II</hi> series in uniformity of style and objectivity of
                    presentation, there are differences worthy of note. There is a noticeable change of style in the
                    chapter on "The Gilberts and Marshalls." In describing the war in the Solomons and <placeName>
                        <country>New Guinea</country>
                    </placeName> areas and vicinity, Richard L. Watson and Kramer J. Rohfleisch give one of the most
                    readable and comprehensible accounts yet to appear in the series. On the other hand the discussion
                    of "The Pattern of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>

                    </placeName> Operations, 1943" is one of the most difficult to follow. In the account
                    entitled "Rabaul and Cape Gloucester," the reader easily confuses the description
                    of the Japanese units with American units.</p>
            <p>As a whole the maps in the present volume are of great improvement and more utility, but in some
                    portions of the text one is easily lost because of a lack or inadequacy of the maps. It is hoped
                    that the future numbers in the series will continue the trend of more useful maps. The employment of
                    symbols has been reduced to a commendable minimum.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> this struggle for the people's rights had as its leader Napoleon Bonaparte
                    Broward; the weight of his influence so impressed itself on his day that it has been called the
                    Broward era.</p>
            <p>Broward's family was one of many impoverished by the Civil War. An orphan from childhood,
                    his rise to reputation and popularity was the result of his own hard work as steamboat captain on
                    the St. Johns River. When the Cuban struggle for independence materialized, Broward, then one of
                    three owners of the tug boat, "The Three Friends," turned filibusterer. He was a
                    startling success both in the amount of arms he carried to <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName> and the amount of controversy he initiated with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> authorities. That he and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> seldom pursued the same policy endeared him to his contemporaries.</p>
            <p>Political forays became part of Broward's life when he became sheriff of Duval County in
                    1891. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the county seat of Duval, presented a lusty picture in those days and Broward added
                    both vitality and variety to the scene. The author is particularly good at narrating this
                    turbulence, drawing color and humor as well as fact from his generous quotations from the press of
                    those years.</p>
            <p>By the time Broward became Governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> in 1905, he had added to his fight against corporate monopoly the project of draining
                    the Everglades, the great area of mucklands and sawgrass stretching for several million acres around
                    and to the south of Lake Okeechobee. Since many of the land, lumber, and railroad interests had
                    large unsatisfied land claims against <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> on the one hand and were liable for drainage taxes on the other, they fought the
                    enterprise. But to a man of Broward's temperament, opposition solidified determination.
                    Drainage operations started with a paucity of both knowledge and money; from the former rose the
                    many problems still unsettled today and from the latter, land speculations and in time land scandals
                    which reverberated throughout the nation. The author leaves a number of questions un-discussed <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-047-3-075"/> covering this phase of the Governor's activities.</p>
            <p>Broward's last fight was his campaign for Senator in 1912. He won but the victory soon lost
                    its point; he died before he could take the coveted seat.</p>
            <p>Mr. Proctor has narrated an excellent study of a picturesque and vital figure of <placeName>

            <p>The history of Simon Cameron's political career is in some detail widely known; not so that
                    of his relevant business career. The author here contributes to the latter, chiefly from
                    "over fifty" Cameron manuscripts in the McNair family collection lately placed in
                    the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery at <placeName>

                        Marino</country>, <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
               </placeName>. Thomas McNair
                    was in partnership with Simon Cameron, S. F. Headley, and Simon Humes "for the manufacture
                    and sale of iron (principally to what is now the <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Railroad)."</p>
            <p>Space does not permit review of all the several interesting features of this book by James B. McNair,
                    "analytical chemist and genealogist." Example: He graphically describes the
                    property of McNair and Company, later Humes, McNair and Company at Foundryville or <placeName>

                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, as a typical iron plantation. It consisted of a large acreage, a post office, a
                    mansion house, homes for workers, schoolhouse, office, store, gristmill, sawmill, blacksmith shop,
                    bake oven, fields, orchards, besides the woods, charcoal house, and furnaces—an
                    almost-sufficient unit not unlike the cotton plantation of the South (pp. 32-35). But this the
                    author fails to emphasize: labor in <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> was "free," while that in the South, which also had iron plantations,
                    was chiefly "slave"; and Cameron did not hesitate,' as late as 1846, to recommend
                    Thomas McNair to James Walker, President James K. Polk's brother-in-law, who had a slave
                    labor iron <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-047-3-076"/> establishment in <placeName>

                    </placeName> (pp. 99-101). A decade later, Simon Cameron was out-spokenly antislavery.</p>
            <p>It is much to the credit of James N. McNair that his book, though based primarily on a mere fraction
                    of the source material which ordinarily would have been created by the partnership, arouses
                    interest, accentuates issues, and yields suggestions. It may well spur people to look to their old
                    family and business correspondence, records, and papers, or to old neglected residues which were
                    thought to be worthless when the main collections, as in the case of the Cameron, were placed in
                    public repositories. May they follow McNair's example in placing their materials where
                    historical interests will be served.</p>

            <head>Personnel of the Rappite Community of Harmony, Indiana, in the year 1824</head>
            <byline>Otis E. Young<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>When the Rappites decided to leave their colony in Indiana and return to <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, power of attorney was given to Frederick Rapp to sell their property. The document
                    dated May 21, 1824, is interesting in that it reveals the names of the members of this communistic
                    sect. While the names of George and Frederick Rapp are well known, the rank and file of the
                    membership have remained in obscurity. Many of the names appear to be misspelled which may be due to
                    the copyist's un-familiarity with the names when they were recorded in the deed record
                    book. As will be noted forty could not write and made their mark.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly many persons joining the colony brought with them quite a bit of property, which was made
                    part of the common holdings. If the list of persons which follows is studied carefully, it will show
                    that there is some evidence that man and wife signed together in about fifty cases. There seems to
                    be no other logical explanation for this except that they may have been man and wife at one time. It
                    does not necessarily mean that they were living together on the date when the document was signed.
                    In signing as couples they may have felt they were protecting the investment they had made in the
                    colony. The renunciation of marriage came in 1807, before the Rappites came to Indiana. How well it
                    was enforced is not known. From time to time new recruits came to the colony from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In checking the list it also appears that men came in groups to sign, and women came in similar
                    groups, which may mean that they reported by place of residence. Interspersed among these groups are
                    the male and female in pairs, bearing the same family name.</p>
            <p>While it has been generally known that the Rappites were a closely knit group of Germans, it would
                    appear that they were even more closely knit, almost to a family basis. Such names as Rapp, Kurtz,
                    Knodel, Bauer, Schmid, Bamesberger, <list type="footnotes">
