            <p>The last thirty years of the nineteenth century formed a distinct period of literary growth in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Both quality and quantity advanced. Every section and nearly every state produced a
                    novelist of power, but greatest activity was evident in the South and West. In Indiana and
                    particularly in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, literature was a popular avenue of expression. It was the fashion to write, perhaps a
                    novel, poetry, essay, or editorial, or if not to write, then certainly to maintain a lively interest
                    in and appreciation of all things literary. Perhaps the democratic spirit and the triumph of
                    individual initiative furnish the explanation sought by historians and psychologists for the zest
                    with which the average Hoosier engaged in literary pursuits. No school lighted his path; he was a
                    pioneer. Though some were properly trained in the art, many followed it with a spontaneity that
                    matched their enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>Before the Civil War the spoken word was much more prominent in Hoosier literature than the written
                    word. Addresses by preachers, lawyers, or politicians on holidays or special occasions were the
                    characteristic literary expression.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Though here and there a poet saw his verses
                    printed in some newspaper or periodical, the publishing of books was not common at that time in
                    Indiana.</p>

                    nineteenth century, literarily speaking, was one of development. Factors which greatly influenced
                    this development were the presence of enterprising booksellers; a publishing house which grew out of
                    the bookselling business of Samuel Merrill and others (dating back to 1838), which still retains
                    Merrill in the firm name; and sympathetic newspaper editors who encouraged the fledgling writers,

                    sought to encourage creative literary activity in the form of original papers presented to the club

                    for judging the success of an organization in attaining its objective lies in the quality and
                    achievements of its membership. Meredith Nicholson, writer and member of the club, declared that it
                    "has illustrated perhaps better than any other expression of the life of Indiana, the
                    quality of the men who have dominated there in the last three decades. In a State where not to be an
                    author is to be distinguished, the members have written and read their essays in that spirit of true
                    cultivation which takes its aspirations and attainments as a matter of course, and not too

                    vexed its discussions, and it has been more interested as a society in Newman, Arnold, and Emerson,

            <p>That there was a desire among professional people to maintain and encourage literary study and
                    activity, at least within their own circle, was indicated by the large proportion of members
                    representing the various professions, such as physicians, lawyers, clergymen, and teachers. Two
                    charter members, Charles Evans, formerly of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and John D. Howland, were also interested in the development of a public library.

                    wide variety of topics to be found in their early programs indicates their breadth of interests, but
                    after the first years the subjects treated became more strictly literary in nature.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> From the beginning meetings were held in an atmosphere of considerable informality but with
                    strong emphasis on high literary standards. The frank criticism to which a paper and its author were
                    subjected not only furnished entertainment for the members, but at the same time challenged writers
                    to their best efforts.</p>
            <p>In the general field of letters during this decade, there were few writers of much importance, and

                    were not much better. Then began a period of two years of going from one small Indiana town to
                    another giving recitals in churches and schoolhouses, all the while rigidly training himself in the
                    art of impersonation.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Years later in <placeName>

                    things that count, for he once remarked to a friend, "If you want to play the part of an

                    attention was given to this in the press, though it was said he made a hit in his performance at the
                        Grand.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> In the fall a benefit was planned at the new Park Theater. He was
                    to be the featured performer and prepared for it with some misgivings. The whole thing seemed risky,
                    for the enormous sum of $50.00 must be paid for the hall.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> But Dan
                    Macauley was behind it and whatever he "undertook for other people … always

            <p>Advance publicity in the press was quite favorable, yet there was a note of skepticism. It was said
                    that he stood without challenge at the head of Indiana poets, but that "he is young, almost
                    boyish in appearance, and lacks that maturity in his methods which time and study only can
                    impart," but in time "he will take a high rank among the literary men of the
                        country."<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>Finally the day came, and Riley was a complete success. The audience paid tribute by demanding an
                    encore, then remaining until they were dismissed by Dan Macauley. Only one adverse criticism was
                    offered. Riley had apparently not fully realized the limits of the room and some in the rear seats
                    had not heard him. The audience was said to be first-class in spite of the bad weather and the

                    writer was a bit too impetuous; teamwork between them was apparently impossible and Riley became
                    somewhat subdued. Urged by his friend, Rev. Myron Reed, not to rush into print but to build up a
                    more solid reputation among central Indiana towns, he waited four years for the appearance of his
                    first book.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

                    Scarcely any program or entertainment was complete without one or more recitations by Riley.
                    Invariably it was reported that he had captured his audience, or had been enthusiastically
                    applauded, or had been requested to give one or more encores.</p>
            <p>Riley's growing popularity encouraged other writers of both prose and poetry to seek fame
                    and fortune in the literary arts and helped usher in a sort of golden age in the cultural life of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Literature and the arts were to flower in an atmosphere in which culture was valued
                    for its own sake. After the advent of natural gas and the consequent industrial activity, Hoosier
                    life was dominated by commercial and financial interests. Expressions of culture then began to
                    function more and more as tools of wealth and power to aid the newly rich to achieve social or class
                    distinction. Factors which had considerable influence on the literary culture of this period were
                    the lecture course or lyceum, the growth of libraries, and the number and character of booksellers
                    and book publishers in the city.</p>
            <p>It is difficult for the present generation to understand the power and influence of the platform in
                    this earlier period. Many elements have combined to change both the audiences and the public
                    speakers so that the type of oratory once popular is no longer fashionable or effective. In the
                    1870's and 1880's the public auditorium and the lectern were important in the
                    dissemination of knowledge and served well as social agencies also. The lecture platform fulfilled a
                    manifold purpose involving education, entertainment, and the advancement <list type="footnotes">

                    Hoosier capital in the 1870's reveals the nature of the purposes they served. Whether these
                    were achieved can, of course, never fully be known. An entertainer may grasp at once his
                    effectiveness, and he who promotes a cause can gauge somewhat the extent to which his propaganda has
                    been accepted; but the lecturer who would educate can never measure the results of his efforts
                    beyond the immediate interest of his listeners. One criterion in any public activity, however, is
                    the extent of its popularity.</p>
            <p>John C. Ridpath, the historian, stated that the real nobility of a community are those who attend
                    lectures. He described the struggles of the lecture field in the 1870's, pointing out that
                    for twenty years oratory or lecturing had been tremendously popular, especially in the wintertime.
                    With the depression of the seventies and the resulting hard times and general pessimism of the
                    populace, it seemed that lecturing became almost extinct. Great lecturers no longer appeared on the
                    platform. Later a new lyceum, more rational and more permanent, arose and flourished for a
                        generation.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> New and powerful speakers appeared to entertain and inspire

                    newspapers. The churches, theaters, and public halls were the auditoriums for lectures on science,
                    religion, art, travel, or pure hokum. It was also the era of dramatic interpretation. Hermann Linde

                    fear which gripped the upper social and economic classes. In 1874 Robert Collyer, noting a small but
                    good audience at Masonic Hall, switched his subject to "Clear Grit," expressing
                    the idea that an honest day's work would bring out one's best qualities, and that
                    the important things were home, family, and contentment.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> A little later a

            <p>By 1877 the worst aspects of the depression had somewhat subsided, and the effect is noted at once in
                    the increased number of lectures. A popular program was held at Harmonic Hall which included

                    scientific and literary topics.</p>
            <p>High on the list of causes being promoted in the 1870's were temperance and women's
                    rights, and prominent among their advocates were Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe,
                    and Mrs. Mary A. Livermore. Both Mrs. Howe and Mrs. Livermore were entertained several times by the
                    College Corner Club. Twice Mrs. Livermore surprised her audience by speaking on a literary topic,
                    not once mentioning the question of women's rights.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>

                    different sense. At that moment it constituted a reason for the series of lectures on cooking
                    delivered by Miss Juliet Corson. Behind the movement were some of the same women who were active in

                    the general effort of women of that day to find increasing avenues for self-expression. In October,
                    1879, membership totalled 130, less than half of whom were wholly interested in the

            <p>No better indication of the cultural temper and achievement of a people is readily available than the
                    growth and development of libraries. For the country as a whole, the first three-quarters of the
                    nineteenth century showed very little progress in this direction, but in the last quarter there was
                    a great increase in the number and size of libraries. An increase in population and wealth, the
                    spread of education and culture, and the work of librarians with enlarged vision all contributed to
                    this growth. The 1876 Exposition at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> , which did so much to stimulate activities in other cultural fields, had a share in
                    the development of libraries, for out of this meeting of minds grew the American Library Association
                    and the establishment of the <hi rend="i">Library Journal.</hi>

                    </placeName> had three libraries and a Library Association, but no free public library. The State
                    Library, occupying the west half of the first floor of the State Capitol with its 25,000 volumes,
                    was established in 1825, with its circulation restricted to state officials and legislators. It
                    operated on an extremely small budget furnished by action of the state legislature. The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County Library, established in 1844, had 2,000 volumes and a fund of $2,000
                    with accruing interest. The township library was an indifferent collection of about 1,000 volumes
                    under the supervision of the township trustee. Of these three, none had adequate means or reason to
                    fulfill the purpose of a public library. The basis for such an institution was to be found in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Library Association, a group of public-spirited citizens who banded together in 1869,
                    each pledged to contribute a sum of $150.00 in annual payments of $25.00.
                    Within a few months' time 3,000 volumes were collected, the circulation of which remained

                    date, 1871, financial support for a library came from a city school tax, so that legally the library
                    has always been part of the city school system.</p>

            <p>Library reports show that in 1877–1878 the aggregate number of books and pamphlets
                    circulated was 192,076, the largest figure since the library opened in 1873. The next year,
                    1878–1879, while there was a steady increase in the accessions of the library, the
                    circulation was 14,573 less than the preceding year. During 1877–1878, 2,209 new
                    registration cards had been issued while only 2,032 were issued in 1878–1879. Circulation
                    figures dropped again in 1880, and still more in 1881. The report stated further that this coincided
                    with a general falling off of library circulation throughout the country and was thought to be
                    caused by a general revival of trade and industry and a wide demand for labor of all kinds.<hi rend="sup">91</hi> At this time a relaxation of rules indicated a desire on the part of the
                    library's officers to make its book collection of greater service. Now each patron was
                    permitted to borrow three books at a time instead of one. Before this time only persons over twenty
                    were permitted to read bound volumes of illustrated papers; now, anyone, old or young, might use

                    impractical to attempt to house such a rapidly growing institution with another which was constantly
                    expanding. Two questions demanded solution—what sort of new quarters should be sought,
                    and their proper location in the city. The Circle was regarded by many as the proper site for a

            <p>During 1878–1879 while the library officers with their limited funds were searching for
                    adequate quarters to house the books and provide suitable space for patrons, two offers were made
                    concerning a new library building. Mrs. James M. Hume proposed a new building at Meridian and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> streets which would be 120 by 70 feet in modern Gothic style of brick and cut stone and
                    would provide space for 100,000 volumes. A few months later William H. English offered to erect a
                    building on the Circle, its front 40 feet wide, extending 150 feet back to the alley, and 50 feet
                    wide at the rear. Its fagade would be of iron and glass and the remainder of substantially fireproof
                    material. The library would be on the ground floor with space for school offices elsewhere in the
                    building. If the school board would accept the offer, English planned to extend the building in the
                    same style around the Circle from McKernan's residence to the church, which would make one
                    of the finest buildings in the city. He offered to donate $5,000 if the school board
                    would purchase the building, or he would lease it for twenty years at $2,400 a year,
                    which was $600 less than the rent the library was then paying.<hi rend="sup">95</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The plan was thoroughly discussed by the press and from time to time English altered his proposed
                    plans at the suggestion of the school commissioners.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> Objections and criticisms
                    were offered and more plans were desired by the board to compare with the generous offers already
                        made.<hi rend="sup">97</hi> Finally, because of the spirit of carping and misrepresentation
                    English withdrew all offers he had made.<hi rend="sup">98</hi> though he had planned ultimately to
                    give the building and grounds to the city. No further mention was made of Mrs. Hume's offer
                    to construct a building at Meridian and <placeName>

            <p>In the eighties all Indiana burned with a flame of literary enthusiasm. It was the period when
                    numerous county histories appeared, perhaps because the pioneers of Indiana had become prosperous
                    old men who were ready to pay the price for being immortalized. Some Indianans were writing novels
                    in series, such as <hi rend="i">Elsie Dinsmore, The Little Colonel</hi>, and the <hi rend="i">Brownie</hi> books;<hi rend="sup">109</hi> but more were enthusiastic about poetry.
                    "For some reason, about one Hoosier in ten writes what he believes to be poetry, whether or

                    and down in the neighborhood of the newspaper offices on Market Street. They read their compositions
                    to each other; sometimes the listener had been seized by the coat lapel and pushed unceremoniously
                    into the nearest doorway for the purpose. The writer, of course, expected his lines to be published
                    in the <hi rend="i">Atlantic.</hi>

            <p>Ben D. House was virtual poetic dictator of the Inland City in the early eighties. Meredith Nicholson

                    Nicholson declared, "If you do not in this provincial capital meet an author at every

            <p>As many as fifty literary clubs may have been functioning by the late seventies, but evidence of the
                    names of all these is not extant and to follow their development is difficult. A number are
                    mentioned in newspapers throughout the decade of the eighties, but whether they had an earlier
                    origin or how long they continued to exist is not known. The Hesperian Club is an example of one
                    which was founded earlier and must have been popular, because among the members were many prominent

            <p>In 1889, shortly after the founding of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the Indiana
                    Union of Literary Clubs, a statewide organization, was formed. Both men and women were admitted to
                    membership; and it planned annual meetings for the discussion of all questions pertaining to social,
                    educational, or literary matters. Any organization having for its objective the study of literature,
                    art, or music, was eligible to membership. By 1900 the Indiana Union joined the General Federation.
                    Since the former was a mixed group, this combination resulted in the odd situation of men as
                    legitimate members of a woman's club.<hi rend="sup">132</hi> Similarity in the aims of both

                    programs devoted largely to literary topics, though other subjects such as socialism, nihilism, and
                    various phases of education, were occasionally treated.<hi rend="sup">135</hi>

                    himself a member, once remarked that if all who belonged were to be expelled, none could hope to be
                    readmitted. A number of famous persons were entertained, including Maththew Arnold, Dean Farrar,
                    Joseph Parker, and John Fiske.<hi rend="sup">136</hi> Women were invited to participate for the

                    Once each month a regular guest night was held when ladies were invited and urged to participate in
                        discussions.<hi rend="sup">138</hi> Its meeting place during the early eighties was the Denison
                    Hotel parlors, where members sometimes remained after the program to indulge in a bit of
                    card-playing. Such a sedate group could not continue in this manner, for their wives and society
                    both frowned on such activity. So in 1884 the meeting place was changed to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Woman's Club during the eighties continued to encourage intellectual and
                    literary activities. Its early programs had been somewhat domestic in character; but during this
                    decade they became more scholarly, and plans were made for a five-year study of English as well as
                    French history.<hi rend="sup">140</hi> Membership was limited to a hundred and each year the names
                    of many prominent women were added to the list of life members.<hi rend="sup">141</hi> The problem
                    of a permanent meeting place was solved in 1891 when the organization met in the newly completed

                    status of women, and the forming of the State Federation in 1889 further demonstrated the trend.

            <p>What baseball was to other boys, history was to Claude Gernade Bowers. His was the good fortune to

                    scholars stocked the public library with good books; and encouragement was given to independent
                    scholarship. An undersized schoolboy, Bowers was a constant visitor to the public library, a young
                    scholar who dared engage the full works of Jefferson and Hamilton. Day after day he read near one of
                    the large windows, vicariously experiencing history, politics, and public affairs. In each field he
                    was to have moments of glory of his own.</p>

            <p>Bowers' interest in history germinated early. Born in Hamilton County, Indiana, on November
                    20, 1878, he spent his childhood in Whitestown and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As the only child of a merchant, he was thrown much upon himself for companionship and
                    substituted books for playmates. At the age of ten, history became his favorite reading when he
                    chanced upon a standard history of the <placeName>

                    refused at first, thinking it beyond his years, but relented and purchased her son's first

            <p>Literature was a compelling interest in high school. Eschewing sports and hobbies, he spent much time

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    enough to fill a magazine for a year, and happily took the manuscripts to a printer. When the
                    printer told them how much it would cost to publish their material, Bowers says, it "scared
                    us stiff." Forthwith they returned the manuscripts, ending their literary venture.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bowers also had a strong interest in political oratory. A partisan from the cradle, as he facetiously
                    remarks, he came from families of unequivocal politics. His paternal grandfather had been a
                    confirmed Democrat; his maternal grandfather, an original Republican who fell at Missionary Ridge.
                    The maternal line had the greater influence, for he reached the threshold of maturity thinking he
                    was a political kinsman of Alexander Hamilton. Planning a discussion of Hamilton for the state high
                    school oratorical contest of 1898, he read the statesman's complete works. To his dismay,
                    he discovered he could never agree with him on fundamentals. It was then too late to choose and
                    prepare a new topic. Rather than submerge his own principles, he confined the discussion to
                    Hamilton's role in the ratification of the Constitution.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Yet he wandered in a political no-man's land. Trying to reorient himself, he carefully read
                    the works of Jefferson, becoming a devoted Democrat and ardent Jeffersonian in the process.</p>
            <p rend="center">III</p>
            <p>While he was certain about his politics, young Bowers was uncertain about a career when he graduated
                    from Short-ridge High School in 1898. Because his father had died and left him without resources,
                    college training appeared hopeless. However, financial assistance was proffered by Addison C.
                    Harris, an attorney who once was minister to <placeName>
                        <country reg="au"> Austria </country>
                    </placeName>. Harris also promised a position in his law firm after college, but in exchange he
                    wanted Bowers' promise to stay out of politics. Though the offer assured a comfortable
                    start in life, Bowers refused to mortgage his future. Independently he began reading law in the
                    rooms of Burke and Warrum, studying history in the public library, and preparing for politics.</p>
            <p>During the two years succeeding graduation, the champion orator emerged as a budding spokesman for
                    the Democratic party. By addressing a state Democratic banquet and writing his first articles for an
                    obscure magazine, he came under the notice of Samuel E. Morss, editor of the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                        </placeName> Sentinel.</hi> Morss sent for and talked with the young man. Later, in 1900, the
                    chief editorial writer—Jacob Piatt Dunn, who was also an Indiana
                    historian—employed him as an editorial writer for the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>, which
                    had been the party's organ since 1841.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bowers was delighted with the opportunity of the editorial page. Without a scintilla of guidance or
                    training, he relied upon his great store of reading—especially of eighteenth and
                    nineteenth century oratory—in developing a method and style of his own. Neither then nor
                    subsequently was he a reporter.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> After two years in this occupation, he

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> as he had earlier impressed <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Within fifteen months after his arrival as an unknown newspaperman, he was nominated
                    unanimously for Congress at the age of twenty-six.</p>
            <p>Knowing that 1904 would be a landslide year for Theodore Roosevelt, and lesser Republicans along with
                    him, Bowers was reluctant to run. But politicians persuaded him he would obligate the party if he
                    would campaign, because a good congressional candidate would help the local ticket. With that
                    prospect, he accepted the nomination. For seven weeks he spoke twice daily throughout the
                    seven-county district and wrote editorials at night by lamplight in country hotels. Though defeated,
                    he at least had the satisfaction of having run far ahead of the ticket. Two years later the party
                    repaid its obligation. In 1906, a more auspicious year for Democrats, he was again nominated
                    unanimously for Congress, but he lost by a narrow margin.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, he secured a political position the same year, beginning an eleven-year absence from
                    the editorial room. Because of party considerations, he accepted appointment on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Board of Public Improvements, serving from 1906 to 1911. From first to last he was
                    unhappy in local politics.</p>
            <p>An opportunity to escape the narrow municipal field came in 1911—the same year that he
                    married Sybil McCaslin, who was to bear his only child, Patricia. John W. Kern defeated Albert J.
                    Beveridge for the <placeName>

                    year with Kern for the experience and then resign, Bowers found himself trapped by political
                    circumstances. Kern became Democratic leader of the Senate during the first Wilson administration,
                    and was absent from the office for days at a time because of caucuses, conferences, and floor

                    </placeName> and America, his talent demanded expression, and his restlessness yearned for an

            <p>Voracious reading led to a book on British address,<hi rend="sup">13</hi> which aroused his interest

                    Clark, he was introduced to an Irish audience that took him for its own. For the next ten years he

                    Kern's office he wrote his first volume—<hi rend="i">Irish Orators</hi>,
                    published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1916, in the author's thirty-eighth year. Publication

            <p>At the same time, Bowers found his way back to a newspaper. After Kern was defeated for re-election

                    historians had been unjust to Jackson's Kitchen Cabinet, he consulted Beveridge, who
                    remained a personal friend despite political differences. In Beveridge's suggestion that he
                    survey the party conflicts of the Jackson period<hi rend="sup">17</hi> he found his literary
                    challenge. When at last he had completed a two-volume work, <hi rend="i">Party Battles of the
                        Jackson Period</hi>, he submitted the manuscript to Houghton Mifflin, who were to be his
                    publishers until 1950. In seeking an appraisal of the manuscript, the publisher sent it to William
                    E. Dodd, himself a Jeffersonian, who was then teaching history at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Dodd recommended publication and became one of the author's strongest
                    champions. Before publishing the book, Houghton Mifflin insisted that it be pared to one volume,
                    despite the strong objections of Dodd, who felt the work deserved the broader canvas of two volumes.</p>
            <p>The unabashed partisanship, flowing style, and extensive research of <hi rend="i">Party Battles</hi>
                    drew national recognition and enthusiastic reviews in 1922. In the <hi rend="i">

            <p>With <hi rend="i">Party Battles</hi> Bowers embarked upon a career as an historian of crisis,
                    choosing his themes from the "critical periods" of history: the triumph of
                    democracy over aristocracy in the Jackson period, the epochal conflict of Jefferson and Hamilton,
                    the retrograde decade after the Civil War, the election and administrations of Jefferson, and an act
                    from the French drama of 1789.</p>
            <p>Coincidentally, he was elevated in his profession. Editors of the <hi rend="i">

                    explored their era in detail.</p>
            <p>The result was one of his favorite books—<hi rend="i">Jefferson and Hamilton, The Struggle
                        for Democracy in America</hi> (1925). While he had seemed self-conscious in a new discipline
                    with <hi rend="i">Party Battles</hi>, his handling of <hi rend="i">Jefferson and Hamilton</hi> was
                    comfortable and confident. Conceiving that both men had been essential in creating the nation and
                    that enemies and idolaters had created myths about each, he sought to tell the story of their
                    struggle "with complete justice to both."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> His
                    two-dimensional writing re-created the figures of the era and the era itself.</p>
            <p>Scholars recognized it as a significant study by a man who was at home in the period and knew his
                    characters down to their slightest peccadilloes. Samuel Flagg Bemis judged that Bowers had surpassed
                    James Parton—the biographer of Jefferson—in both knowledge and accuracy, and
                    incidentally, called on him three years later to help write the chapters on William M. Evarts in the
                    seventh volume of <hi rend="i">The American Secretaries of State and Their Diplomacy.</hi> Nathaniel
                    W. Stephenson found it "a brilliant, confident book that bowls over the general reader, and
                    leaves him gasping with delight." J. Fred Rippy thought the characters were overdrawn and
                    the period overdramatized in an otherwise "great book."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>Despite full-time participation in a competitive profession that leaves little energy for other
                    writing, Bowers was indefatigible in writing books of fresh appeal; indeed, his total production has
                    exceeded that of many professional historians whose academic assignments theoretically allow time
                    for research. In 1927 he edited the <hi rend="i">Diary of Elbridge Gerry, Jr.</hi>, mildly received
                    as a welcome but minor addition to historical literature. Then he mined the ever-rich Civil War and
                    Reconstruction period.</p>
            <p>Combining careful scholarship with a revisionist viewpoint toward Reconstruction, he fashioned <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era, The Revolution after Lincoln</hi> (1929). Recasting familiar characters
                    in new roles of hero and villain, he rode the riptide of the iconoclastic twenties and caught the
                    public fancy. His sometimes enraged tale of Reconstruction commanded a Literary Guild sale of
                    100,000 copies, three other editions, and the scrutiny of scholars.</p>
            <p>Preferring to recognize Bowers as the foremost American practitioner of something called personal
                    history, but not as a professional historian, Arthur Schlesinger, Sr., found the book admirable.
                    Nathaniel W. Stephenson was disappointed by the tone of <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> after the
                    promise of <hi rend="i">Jefferson and Hamilton.</hi> He said it was "an historical
                    misfortune" that so capable a man should be "an historian turned
                    advocate." Nevertheless, he hesitated to protest all the conclusions, because much in the
                    book was sound, and he recognized that the collection of additional dispassionate data might in time
                    establish the Bowers interpretation.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From a western viewpoint, James C. Malin gave it a high place in Reconstruction historiography. He
                    wondered, however, whether it was just to consider "carpetbaggism" an exclusive
                    southern custom since western states also were then governed by gentlemen with taking ways.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Other critics found it "an unforgettable record of an unforgivable

                    had been something of an idol in earlier years, and his career as <placeName>

                    </placeName> Senator from Indiana further won the admiration of Bowers. Devoting himself to a
                    scholarly biographical study, Bowers produced <hi rend="i">Beveridge and the Progressive Era</hi>,
                    another Literary Guild selection. Building upon extensive documentary materials, he told the story
                    from Beveridge's viewpoint—the viewpoint of a Republican. By thus laying aside
                    his own partisanship, which had been honestly exhibited in earlier books, Bowers stepped into a new
                    literary milieu. Unable to brandish the bull-whip of political attack, he restricted himself to
                    portraying Beveridge as orator, statesman, and biographer against the background of his times. The
                    greater reserve of <hi rend="i">Beveridge and the Progressive Era</hi> forced a sacrifice of a good
                    part of the indignation and zest that marked the earlier books, but through it another side of
                    Bowers' talent was displayed. It was the work of a historian able to subordinate his own
                    political prejudice in making a systematic examination of a historical subject. The book fully

            <p>Besides fighting the political battles of an age gone by, Bowers fought the party battles of his own
                    age. In the Democratic state convention of 1918—where his old friend Senator Samuel M.
                    Ralston started an abortive third-term movement for Woodrow Wilson<hi rend="sup">29</hi>—he was chairman of the platform committee. To him came an emissary from the
                    President, bearing three or four resolutions dealing with postwar measures, which Wilson wanted
                    adopted, their White House origin secret—a difficult assignment, to be sure, but Bowers
                    carried it off.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> For the 1920 Democratic state convention he delivered the
                    keynote speech.</p>
            <p>As an orator he was in frequent demand. Drawing upon his wide knowledge for something to say and upon
                    his artistry with words to say it effectively, he made audiences forget he was a "homely
                    little runt."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> He worked the same magic in the keynote address at the
                    National Democratic Jackson Day banquet in 1928. When Bowers finished speaking, he received the
                    compliment supreme from Will Rogers who rose and said: "There isn't any use of me
                    or anybody else sayin' anything more. That little fellow stole the show!"<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jackson Day speech was but a prelude to a greater oration. Needing a man who could whip them into
                    a frenzy of party devotion, the Democrats called on him for the keynote speech at the national
                    convention in <placeName>

                    Too, the Spanish experiment with a republic might provide new insight for the student of the early
                    American republic. But any hope of rest was shattered by the Civil War which began in 1936. When the
                    unrest and violence commanded the concern of other governments, Bowers walked the streets of Madrid
                    in old clothes and slouch hat. Returning to the embassy, he placed a direct call to Secretary of
                    State Cordell Hull with a personal report on what the people of the streets were saying. During six
                    years in Madrid he established a reputation as "a careful, painstaking executive,"
                    and was a consistent supporter of the Loyalists, whose government he saw as a democracy opposing

                    at home through correspondence with party leaders, including President Roosevelt. His personal

                  <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Roosevelt asked Bowers to make the nominating speech in 1932, but the
                    latter's personal situation forced him to decline, and he voted for Al Smith. However, the
                    Roosevelt-Bowers relationship remained close. The President personally requested Bowers to conduct a
                    cross-country speaking tour in 1936 (to which Bowers had previously objected, thinking it was not
                    proper for a diplomat to do so), but the Spanish Civil War forestalled it. In 1940,
                    Bowers—again on the ground of propriety—declined an invitation to make six
                    campaign speeches. During his years abroad, Bowers remained in correspondence with Roosevelt, and
                    the last letter he received from the President was dated and signed on the morning of the
                    President's last day. Bowers agreed with the drastic measures taken by the New Deal to
                    revive the nation's economy, knowing that Roosevelt thought he was saving the capitalistic
                    system in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, with which Bowers also agreed. Likewise, Bowers says that he has maintained cordial
                    relations with Harry S. Truman. Looking back now, Bowers can sum up his reactions to the New
                    Deal-Fair Deal as a feeling that it was a time of revolutionary movements and inescapable changes
                    which made the New Deal-Fair Deal programs necessary. For him, it was a choice between reform and
                        revolution.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    to animate a period, its people, and its spirit, Bowers concentrated on the political contests and
                    their implications for America. A fairly popular book which went through five printings, it drew the
                    usual commendations. A member of the House of Commons wrote the <placeName>

                    received enthusiastically by reviewers who knew he had re-created an atmosphere and long-forgotten
                    people, and it had a large sale in South America.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

               <hi rend="i">Young Jefferson</hi>, the skimpiest of the political books, completed a Jefferson

                    fiery, perhaps more scholarly. Again the work suffered by comparison with the earlier Bowers. Yet it
                    was generally received with favor by scholarly reviewers, who nonetheless thought it still
                    fashionable in the forties to invoke the Menckenistic reservations of the twenties. Referring to
                    "plushy prose," Richard Hofstadter decreed that "within the limits of his
                    particular medium, which is long on romance and the merely personal, and somewhat short on sharp
                    historical insight, Mr. Bowers has, however, done a fairly good job." Conversely, Howard
                    Fast thought the Jefferson trilogy "makes one of the most thoughtful and profound
                    investigations of our history ever undertaken by one man." Looking at the three works in
                    whole, Carl Bridenbaugh found them "most influential in shifting popular conceptions
                    concerning the founding of the Republic." With much to criticize in detail, Bridenbaugh
                    decided the trilogy in general was of "prime value," although he suggested,
                    "Perhaps someone could edit Mr. Bowers for us."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

                    Bowers capitalized upon research in the French archives, where his daughter Patricia helped, in

                    reviewers gave it something distinctly less than rave notices. However, Bowers says, "The

            <p>Bowers' later works show a decided change in style. Where the first several moved with the
                    impassioned pleading of an advocate at the bar, his later ones moved at a new
                    pace—slower, more circumspect, more judicious. An analysis of the cause of the change
                    must await a definitive biography, but several speculations suggest themselves now: His writing may
                    have been affected by a diplomat's habit of thought, more judicious than the partisan habit
                    of an editorial writer. Or he may have had less time to assimilate his material. Or he may have been
                    working with materials from a less familiar setting.</p>
            <p>His latest book, <hi rend="i">My Mission to <placeName>

                    first in Madrid and rewritten twice in Santiago, it draws upon his official dispatches, diary,
                    travels, and observations during a six-year period. It is a climactic achievement of a notable
                    career: a historian who left the study to help make the history of his times.</p>

            <p>Claude Bowers approached his work in the spirit of a crusader. Intensely devoted to liberty and
                    popular sovereignty, he early interpreted American history as a contest between privilege and
                    democracy. Representing the distortions of Federalist and Republican historians, he presented a
                    fresh picture with fully digested material in becoming the outstanding historian of Democratic
                    presidents. With the singleness of purpose of a debater in rebuttal, he sought to redress the
                    balance in favor of Jefferson, Jackson, and Johnson.</p>
            <p>Looking at Jefferson, on whom he has done his best work, he found the philosopher of <placeName>

                    methods in government. Moreover, he believed, the Jeffersonians won office by appealing to the
                    economic and political interests of the people, not to their passions.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The accession of Andrew Jackson he viewed as overturning the aristocrats and intellectuals as the
                    source of political power, replacing them with the articulate people. Recognizing that party
                    politics in the modern sense began with Jackson, he conceded and defended the origin of the spoils
                    system as being so adaptable to party rank and file that politicians of all parties have used it.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Bowers perspective, prejudice against Andrew Johnson had fed on enormous falsehoods. After
                    examining the details of Johnson's life, he concluded that Johnson had not been a traitor
                    to the Republican party, because he had always been a Democrat; that he held steadfastly to his view
                    of the purposes of the Civil War; and that he certainly was not a drunkard.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Presenting a revised view at a time other historians also were revising the Reconstruction story,
                    Bowers was not content merely to state the facts as he saw them. On the contrary, he called earlier
                    historians to account, reserving especial sarcasm and ridicule for John B. McMaster and Henry
                        Adams.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Carrying his resentment into his own day, he wrote in a book review
                    that some American leaders were supposed to be sacred from candid analysis, but they all happened to
                    be Federalist or Republican.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did not always regard Federalists and Republicans as sinister villains, however. He respected
                    Hamilton's political genius and statesmanship; indeed, he said Hamilton's distrust
                    of democracy is easier to understand than Jefferson's faith. Even the Federalist party he
                    could view as the most brilliant and most attractive, in terms of leadership, that <list type="footnotes">

                    because they did not understand the spirit of their times, did not seek contact with the common man,

                    assumption of state debts and location of the national capital.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> But in later
                    works many of the grays gave way to sharp black and white. He flailed Chief Justice John Marshall
                    for appearing at a dinner with Burr just before he was to preside at the latter's trial.
                    But he had no criticism for President Johnson who appeared at a reception given by Chief Justice

                    Mirroring his absorption of historic address, the sentences are fulsome, evocative, and emotional on
                    occasion. Rhythmically, they resemble the cadence of Macaulay, a kindred spirit in aim and
                    interests. Borrowing also from the lexicon of the editorial writer, he employs repetition and
                    innuendo to emphasize Henry Adams' "quaint" interpretation of history,
                    and to suggest turpitude in the making of John Marshall's "midnight

                    <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-052-3-048"/> he shapes trivial detail into vivid descriptions, essays
                    sometimes forming entire chapters which he calls portraits—"Andrew Johnson: A
                    Portrait," "Hamilton: A Portrait."</p>
            <p>Some of the portraits stand alone as monuments of the essayist's art. In a portrait he
                    explores every facet of a man's character—background, intellectual endowment,
                    dress, habits, sincerity, and other attributes. Yet he does so in a refreshing, matter-of-fact
                    manner, shunning the gobbledegook of psychological analysis. What he intends is a re-creation of
                    each man—"warts and all." Shown both in repose and disheveled in the
                    sweat of conflict, the figures of American history lose their austerity and remoteness. Under
                    Bowers' hand they emerge as ordinary beings who "lived in houses, danced, gambled
                    and drank, flattered and flirted, gossipped and lied, in a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> of unpaved streets and sticky black mud, made their way to night conferences through
                    dark, treacherous thoroughfares, and played their brilliant parts in a bedraggled, village-like
                    capital … peculiarly crude and filled with grotesque incongruities."<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His conception of history embracing both Emerson (history is biography) and Belloc (history is
                    melodrama), Bowers never loses his sense of the dramatic. Using the novelist's third person
                    point of view, he establishes contact with the reader who is conducted to legislative gallery and
                    racetrack to see the men of history at work and play. A true narrator, he never loses the thread of
                    the story, never leaves impact to chance. The reader also feels the presence of the author as a
                    convivial guide.</p>
            <p>Bowers' pages are enlivened by his own expressionisms and sardonic humor. For example:
                    "Here let us enter and pay our respects to His Excellency Robert K. Scott of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    something clammy in his humor—like a surgeon joking at his job."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Picturesque language restores the spirit of the moment. For example: "the bung

            </p>
            <p>His books are organized with precision. Opening with a brief, concise, and pungent preface, he
                    announces his purpose and partiality. Better than most, he knows the work that is expected of a
                    preface, and he makes it a succinct, interesting essay. The book proper is built around topical
                    chapters, following a general but not always specific chronological progression—in this,
                    his greatest weakness is that dates are not always indicated. The chapters are composed of a series
                    of descriptions of men or events in close focus—almost an episodic
                    treatment—set apart by Roman numerals. Beaded on narrative string, the vignettes often
                    are literary gems, such as the description of John Randolph, the boy who looked like an old man.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still, there are occasional frailties in his style. Enthusiasm leads to overstatement and romanticism
                    on occasion, as when he has William B. Giles setting forth on a trip with his Negro slave,
                    "no doubt kicking, cursing, and loving him all the way."<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
                    Sometimes the reader reacts negatively to the frequent parallels of American developments and
                    episodes of the French Revolution. The only serious complaint against <hi rend="i">The Tragic
                    Era</hi>, in a criticism written for the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi>, was the
                    strident style and continuous indictment.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, no critic can gainsay that Bowers achieves the purpose announced in the preface. Here he has
                    a distinct advantage over the historian who presents facts with finality but neglects to let the
                    reader know what beliefs he holds. Thus one is forced to read such a historian carefully and warily.
                    But, forewarned by knowledge of Bowers' sentiments and reassured by many direct quotations
                    in the text, one can read him in relaxed comfort.</p>
            <p rend="center">IX</p>
            <p>Bowers' methods are those of a careful scholar and literary artist who taxes himself with

                    completing all notes before ever fashioning a line.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Research is more than
                    gathering and assessing the significance of facts; he does not cease until able to visualize his
                    subjects. Nor is he content to create a mental picture of them with their materials alone. No, he
                    even wants to know the kind of wine and brand of snuff preferred by their associates.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> He enjoys writing history more than he enjoys any of his numerous other activities. For
                    him, writing is relaxation, but it is hard work, too. He writes each book at least three
                    times—the first draft rapidly, the second for proportion, the third for publication.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is a synthetist, not content to add a brick and splotch of mortar, but desirous of erecting a
                    noble literary edifice. In re-creating a period, he must work on a broad canvas, pulling together a
                    composite picture from biographies, autobiographies, diaries, correspondence, newspapers, memoirs,
                    congressional debates, contemporary pamphlets, and magazines. While the original material of the
                    monographic historian is conspicuous by its brevity in the Bowers bibliography, one notices the
                    works consulted emphasize published personal papers. However, original material was used without
                    stint in <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> and <hi rend="i">Pierre Vergniaud.</hi> Bowers has high
                    respect for newspapers as source material, but he uses them in their best adaptation—for
                    descriptions and as an indication of the rumors, anger, and feeling of the age. For he feels that
                    actual historic truth is no more important than what participants believed was the truth.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His books are well documented. Sometimes he will show the reader how he critically evaluates sources.
                    In describing Jefferson's person, he notes that the report of a woman without objectionable
                    prejudice is preferable to that of an embittered enemy. Again, in describing public men of the
                    1830's, he notes that the remarks of Miss Harriet Martineau and Mrs. Margaret Bayard Smith
                    are in harmony.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

                    </placeName> City where his life follows the pattern of fifty years—writing, lecturing,
                    and speaking—Bowers refuses to closet himself from the main currents of life. With
                    Polybius, he feels the historian should be a man of action. Further, he thinks a man actively
                    engaged in the affairs of today is better able to understand the affairs of yesterday. He has
                    observed that historians of the cloister, finding a document issued by a public man in explanation
                    of conduct, are apt to consider it as final authority. Actually, he says, the man of affairs,
                    politician, or journalist knows these documents often are camouflage. Bowers wants to see the
                    letters exchanged at the time the document was prepared as well as the memoirs of after years.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> While his critique has some merit, it does not give proper weight to the
                    historian's internal criticism.</p>
            <p>Summing up his work to date: Bowers thinks <hi rend="i">Party Battles</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jefferson
                        and Hamilton</hi> introduced a new method that has been adopted rather widely. Prior to his
                    work, he finds, most books on Jefferson were hostile; since his work, later writers have treated
                    Jefferson with greater respect. Likewise, he thinks <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> helped change
                    northern opinion of Reconstruction. He disavows an original intent to defend Johnson, but in writing
                    honest history he found—and, to his satisfaction, proved—that Johnson was a
                    great man, a courageous defender of the Constitution. Since <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi>, he
                    believes, historians have treated Johnson more respectfully.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> However, a
                    contrary opinion must be noted: Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr., denies that the Johnson of Bowers is
                    essentially different from the Johnson of Dunning, Rhodes, and Oberholtzer.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>
                    One critic said Bowers is in rebellion "against the sort of historical writing that merely
                    analyzes, merely understands … and his own aim is to arrive at an imaginative
                        understanding."<hi rend="sup">72</hi> Some few commentators have challenged his
                    interpretations and conclusions, but none his accuracy or choice of sources.</p>

            <p>In evaluating the work of Claude Bowers, one cannot ignore his popular standing. Whereas eighteen of
                    the sixty best histories of 1920–1950 average about seven thousand sales each,<hi rend="sup">73</hi> Bowers averaged about thirty-two thousand sales with each of the eight books
                    published by Houghton Mifflin between 1922 and 1945—from <hi rend="i">Party Battles</hi>
                    through <hi rend="i">Young Jefferson.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">74</hi> If the contrast means anything, it
                    means the American public is interested in and wants to read history, provided the historian
                    troubles himself to write for them as as well as for his colleagues.</p>
            <p>Bowers took that trouble. He found and used the formula for the compound of accurate history and
                    entertaining narrative in fifteen books and at least nine articles—"history as

            <p>When the motor car was still a novelty, as you traveled about in the Midwest, you would often see, as
                    you approached some village, a more or less battered signboard by the side of the road. On the board
                    you might notice an advertisement for the grocery, the bank, the drug store, the hardware store, the
                    drygoods store, and the blacksmith shop. At the top of the sign appeared the name of the village and
                    just beneath it these words, "The hub of the universe." You would smile at that,
                    but it was no joke to the people who lived there. Here their fathers had lived and died and here
                    they were buried. From this place they looked out on the affairs of the world and viewed the stars
                    at night. Here the sun rose and set. It was the hub of the universe to them. A distant Tennyson
                    might complain, <quote rend="blockquote">

                    will be merely a set of problems in historical study. The time may come when some future historian
                    may not even find our century interesting.</p>
            <p>This universal human frailty, to imagine our perspective the favored one, besets the historian as
                    well as the scientist. I am not a historian. I doubt if I could pass an eighth grade examination on
                    the history of Indiana without considerable cramming. But I welcome this opportunity to speak to
                    people interested in history in order to voice a protest against a popular caricature of science.
                    The popular notion has it that the scientist simply makes his mind blank, opens his eyes and ears,
                    and lets the truths of nature pour into his empty mind and form themselves into general ideas. Rid
                    yourselves of all prejudice; lay aside all preconceived notions;—how often we hear that
                    kind of advice. Generally, it seems to me that that is precisely the time to hang rather tightly to
                    some of your prejudices, for the man who speaks wants to make you the easy victim of some ideas that
                    will not stand too close a scrutiny. At any rate, that is not what the scientist does when he enters
                    his laboratory. Before such a vacant mind nature will always maintain a stony silence. She never
                    answers questions until they are asked and part of the growth in science consists in learning to ask
                    the right questions. A scientist has an hypothesis to test, a prejudice if you please. He knows that
                    if his hypothesis is correct he can deduce certain consequences and among them there will be one
                    that can be tested by experiment. And the curious thing is that for any given problem quite a wide
                    variety of hypotheses may be confirmed. Which one of them the scientist chooses to test reflects his
                    interest, his previous notions, his bias.</p>
            <p>It was our American pragmatists, Charles S. Peirce, William James, and Josiah Royce, that first saw
                    this clearly. Royce used to say that any idea is a plan of action. All thought reflects an interest
                    on the part of the thinker. The pure intellect is a myth. One's idea of sword, pen, fly
                    rod, hammer, and so on, always includes the knowledge of how to use them. "Ideas of things
                    never consist of mere images of the things, but always involve a consciousness of how you propose to
                    act towards the things of which you have ideas."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Knowing what <list type="footnotes">

                    clearly observing our attitude towards those facts, our estimate of their value, our response to
                    their presence, our intentions with respect to our future relations with these facts."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Or as William James put it with his brisk language: "If you want an
                    absolute duffer in an investigation, you must, after all, take the man who has no interest whatever
                    in its results: he is the warranted incapable, the positive fool. The most useful investigator,
                    because the most sensitive observer, is always he whose eager interest in one side of the question
                    is balanced by an equally keen nervousness lest he become deceived."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The historian is no exception. Without some preconceived notion, some symptom of a philosophy of
                    history, some bias, he is utterly helpless. You might give him the keys to the census bureau in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> with access to all the census reports that have been taken since 1790. But without some
                    interest, where would he begin? A biased historian is better than a completely
                    "objective" historian, simply because an objective historian cannot be a historian
                    at all. Or to take an illustration that comes home more closely to you all, suppose you were to
                    write a history of southern Indiana, Indiana south of the old national road between the years 1850
                    and 1860. Where would you begin? Would you start searching for letters written during that period?
                    For what would you look in them? You would scour newspapers, court records, church records, observe
                    the price of land? But you would have millions of such records to scan. Why would you turn to them?
                    But if you have a thesis to prove or disprove, say, that since most of the people in southern
                    Indiana were not more than a generation out of <placeName>

                    parts of the country, then you could begin to work. To be sure, if a historian is not a fool, that
                    is a dogmatist, he will be willing to modify his assumptions from time to time, as his own
                    discoveries may dictate. But again and again I have heard the philosophy of history decried as an
                    obstacle, or worse, as a meaningless preoccupation, for the objective historian. We repeat, the

                    dressed up and has no place to go.</p>
            <p>In his recent book on <hi rend="i">Christianity and History</hi> Herbert Butterfield has made much of
                    the difficulties of writing history. He writes: "Amongst historians, as in other fields,
                    the blindest of all the blind are those who are unable to examine their own presuppositions, and
                    blithely imagine therefore that they do not possess any."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> We shall be
                    reminded that historians have agreed on certain canons for the discovery of fact. But the discovery
                    of all such fact as can be agreed upon by historians is not yet history. It is only the skeleton of
                    history. All such facts demand something more for their understanding—the wild,
                    complicated story of the inner life of innumerable people. From Butterfield again: "History
                    deals with the drama of human life as the affair of individual personalities, possessing
                    self-consciousness, intellect and freedom. Imagine human beings without these three things and you
                    will find it difficult to write historical narrative at all … And the historian deals
                    with historical events not as though they were things which could be mechanically and externally
                    explained but as they come out of personalities and run into personalities; so that the insides of
                    human beings have to be brought into the discussion—mind and motive, hope and fear,
                    passion and faith have to come into the question—before we can begin to connect one fact
                    with another and understand anything at all."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> And you can reach the
                    reality of the men and women you study in history only when you realize that you have assumptions,
                    that like the midwestern villager who called his town the hub of the universe, each one of us sees
                    through his own eyes.</p>
            <p>It is likely that any two of us could soon unearth some places where our assumptions differ. So with
                    two historians. And in such cases it is relatively easy for us to become aware of our assumptions,
                    and to recognize that they give our work a bias. But the baffling side of this question is not where
                    we differ, but where we agree. For deep down beneath our differences are the assumptions about which
                    we never <list type="footnotes">

                    aware of them. And here the assumptions of a whole generation are apt to be alike and if so, they
                    are extremely hard to uncover. The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once observed that no
                    generation can become conscious of its deepest and most universal assumptions; it takes a later
                    generation to bring them to light.</p>
            <p>Thus in the later Victorian era, in the period up to the outbreak of the first world war, men just
                    took it for granted that they could look forward to progress. Some of us grew up in that period:
                    while there were individual puzzles about our own future, we gave no worry to the future of mankind.
                    All was secure and stable. I find that young college men stare today with open mouth when I try to
                    explain that mood to them. We were sure not only of safety and peace in the future, not only of
                    industrial and technological progress, but we were on a sort of moral escalator as well which would
                    presently take us to the land of promise. One eloquent clergyman—whose name has been
                    forgotten—about the turn of the century described it thus: "Just over the crest
                    of the hill, the promised land stretches away to the far horizons, bathed in eternal
                    sunshine!" It may be that that generation was under the early spell of Darwinian
                    evolutionism. And they looked back incredulously to an earlier generation that did not share their
                    faith in progress. All we can say today is that the world does not look the same to us. It is likely
                    that no child of today will live long enough to see the return of anything like the placid comfort
                    of late Victorian life. Instead, as Nicholas Berdyaev, Russian historian, put it not long before his
                    death: "We are entering into the realm of the unknown and the unlived, and we are entering
                    it joylessly and without much hope. We can no longer believe in the theories of progress which
                    deceived the minds of the nineteenth century and made the near future seem always to be better, more
                    beautiful and more desirable than what had gone before."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Ferdynand Zweig, formerly of the University of Cracow, in a recent book lays stress on what he calls
                    the "collective social subsconsciousness," which embodies the assumptions of a
                    given period and society. Thus he thinks the marginal <list type="footnotes">

                    atmosphere of the second half of the nineteenth century. Because our own period is interested in
                    planning for a maximum national income, Zweig thinks we have a special advantage in understanding
                    the mercantilist period. But when the basic assumptions are changed then the theories based on those
                    assumptions are no longer relevant. "When the age passes and the assumptions become hollow
                    and empty, the generalizations resemble a deserted palace, visited by tourists and students of
                    history and culture."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these assumptions dictate the interests of the historian. Things that seem important to one
                    generation become trivial to another. That is why good histories have to be rewritten every
                    generation or two. And some day to the discerning historian, the history of histories will become a
                    revealing portrait of the changes in the human mind.</p>
            <p>This is all I have to say about the writing of history. But before closing I should like the
                    privilege of making two brief observations. The social studies would better not lose sight of the
                    perspectives that make the individual what he is. There is some good in statistical studies. They do
                    help to locate problems, but so far as I have found they never solve them. The kind of research that
                    goes on in many colleges of education today is a logical monstrosity. Behind all the statistics are
                    living human beings with their living interests. The social studies had better be aware of that
                    fact. Let me illustrate by supposing two lawyers, one the attorney for a corporation and the other
                    for the union with which that corporation bargains. Let us further suppose that there has been a
                    long record of trouble and that our two lawyers are personal friends. Suppose they go off together
                    to be alone for a weekend at a quiet hotel in the mountains, in the hope that they can work out a
                    basis of future understanding. They will need, of course, all the economic information about the
                    financial position of the company, how the wages of the workers compare with other similar
                    companies, and so on. But this will not be enough. Each man will also need a sympathetic and
                    imaginative insight into the interests that find expression in the theory of the other man, and an
                    honesty in acknowledging his own. It will not be easy to <list type="footnotes">

                    same language. Wherever vital interests are involved, the semantic difficulty can be met only on the
                    moral level.</p>
            <p>And now may I confess my own bias in writing this paper? I believe that individual human beings are
                    priceless, of immeasurable importance. I further believe that in our society we are in grave danger
                    of losing most of the priceless gifts that genuine individuals can bring forth: in science, in
                    industry, in politics, in art, and in religion. Our society, with its worship of bigness, its
                    gigantic currents, its curious fear of novelty, its demands for conformity, is in danger of
                    destroying the individual and thus of destroying itself in the end. I am told, for example, that in
                    the younger grades of some of our public schools if a boy develops some curiosity or interest that
                    takes him off by himself, he is to be discouraged: he needs adaptation to the group. And if he
                    persists in following this private interest he becomes a problem child: the parents are notified
                    that he requires psychiatric treatment. Of course, we need to learn to live and work with other
                    people and the best time to learn that is in early childhood. But can the price be too high? If we
                    suppress all special interests, and turn out of our schools a race of identical intellectual twins,
                    what have we done?</p>
            <p>You see, I am defending the right of our midwestern villager to be different, to call his place the
                    hub of the universe, if he so believes. My protest against the so-called objective scientist is just
                    that he depersonalizes the human being. The individualism for which I plead is not that of the
                    pirate, who wants no rules to inhibit his banditry, but that of the loyal citizen. For the measure
                    of any civilization is not how many motor cars it can make and sell in a given year, but how many
                    free and creative individuals it can accommodate.</p>

            <p>Through the courtesy of Ruskin College, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, I have received permission to publish two manuscripts in which the historian Charles
                    A. Beard recalled at the request of latter-day Ruskin College officials how in 1899 he had helped
                    another American, Walter Vrooman of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, found Ruskin Hall, a center for British workingmen's education.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beard had been graduated from DePauw University in 1898, and in the fall of that same year he arrived
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> to undertake graduate study in history. Aroused by Vrooman's plans for a labor
                    "college," young Beard persuaded his advisor Frederick York Powell, Regius
                    Professor of Modern History at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and several prominent trade unionists as well to lend support to the project. In fact,
                    it appears that Beard was far more responsible for the actual success of Vrooman's plans
                    than was Vrooman.</p>

                    </placeName> to pursue advanced studies in English and European History, I met Mr. Walter Vrooman
                    who had come to the University with a double purpose in mind—to study philosophy and to
                    found a new type of labor movement. Our first meeting was followed by many long conversations about
                    the political and social questions of the day. In the course of these discussions, Mr. Vrooman
                    expressed the conviction that we were at the verge of a great political uprising on the part of
                    labor throughout the western world and that it was the duty of "educated" persons
                    [to] prepare for it. With respect to the several groups that claimed to speak for
                    labor—socialists, individualists, and trade unionists—Mr. Vrooman could
                    scarcely be called a partisan. He repeatedly said that capitalists and workingmen wasted more each
                    year in strikes, lockouts, bickerings, and inefficient organization than the total amount of the
                    surplus values over which they were presumably <list type="footnotes">

                            <p>Vrooman, who was five years Beard's senior, had written <hi rend="i">Government

                                </placeName>, 1897). In the former he defined progress as the "rescuing [of]
                                human affairs from the domain of chance and making them subservient to law."
                                (p. 5). The competitive system of economics had, according to Vrooman, already been
                                destroyed in recent times by the "principle of combination"; the real
                                issue of the times lay between paternalism and democratic socialism. Although the
                                "centralized money power" of modern capitalism had temporarily gained
                                control of political institutions, Vrooman insisted that the "whole trend of
                                our times is toward some form of fraternal socialism." <hi rend="i">(Ibid.</hi>, 10). "I believe," he wrote, "that there is now
                                sufficient existing concrete socialism in the world to give a substantial foundation for
                                the hope that the brotherhood of man, the true cooperative commonwealth shall one day be
                                realized." <hi rend="i">(Ibid.</hi>, 12).</p>
                            <p>Although Vrooman's influence upon Beard's social convictions has been
                                exaggerated, it has not yet been noticed that Vrooman's view of history is
                                essentially that which Beard would present in his <hi rend="i">Industrial
                                Revolution</hi> (<placeName>

                                practices; both had the same optimism concerning the future effects of the
                                "socializing forces" then emerging. The difference between Vrooman and
                                Beard is that Vrooman's writings were explicitly socialistic while
                                Beard's were not.</p>

            <p>On surveying the ground early in the next year, we found that we had numerous endorsements from labor

                    program of studies had been outlined, the scheme of management completed, a project for a
                    correspondence school formulated, a number of students enrolled, and a corps of teachers and
                    lecturers engaged. At last on February 22, 1899, Ruskin Hall was formally opened. Since that time
                    the history of its development appears in its records and achievements.</p>
            <p>The second manuscript was sent by Charles Beard to Lionel Elvin, principal of Ruskin College, on
                    December 18, 1945. Despite certain duplications of the first manuscript, it supplements

            <p>Professor F. York Powell, then Regius Professor of Modern History, received me cordially, talked with
                    me about my backgrounds and interests, and helped me to plan my program of studies. Through his good
                    offices I was soon elected a member of the Stubbs History Club and met several young Englishmen who
                    made me feel at home. Within a few days, I had many acquaintances and was happily settled in my
                    lodgings at 11 Grove Street, ready for work and intellectual adventures.</p>
            <p>Very soon, on an occasion which I do not recall, I met an American who had come to study philosophy
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Walter Vrooman. I had known something about his family in the States and was
                    acquainted slightly with his brother, Carl Vrooman, who later served under President Wilson in the
                    Department of Agriculture; but this was my first meeting with Walter.</p>
            <p>Mr. Vrooman and I had many interests in common, particularly economic theory and the labor movement
                    in the Old World and the New. Strange to relate, he had an idea that in the coming years the Briton
                    and the Slav would collide and that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would be forced to cooperate in turning back the Slavic tide! We often discussed that
                    subject. Mr. Vrooman also believed that the labor movement would become increasingly powerful in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and that the labor leaders of the two countries should go beyond trade union interests
                    and equip themselves for statesmanship. He was convinced that this cause could be aided by
                    establishing a labor college in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with branches in various parts of Great Britain, and by establishing similar
                    institutions in the States. Out of this undertaking, he thought, the workers of the two countries
                    could be brought into a better understanding of their historic role.</p>
            <p>Mr. Vrooman and his wife then lived on Banbury Road and they made a practice of having friends in for
                    tea. At these teas, Mr. Vrooman's ideas were discussed and within a short time several
                    persons expressed a willingness to cooperate in launching the project for a labor college (or
                    "hall" as we called it then) in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After a tentative plan had been drawn up, I presented it to the Trades Union Council
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, held a long discussion with members of the Council, and won their enthusiastic
                    endorsement. Through <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-052-3-067"/> members of the Council I was invited to
                    speak at several places in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> and explain the design for a labor college.</p>
            <p>Alas, owing to my failing memory, I cannot recall the names of all the men and women who were early
                    interested in the project. But I remember that before or soon after Ruskin Hall was opened in St.
                    Giles, in February, 1899, the following friends had been gathered together in support of the
                    project: H.B. Lees Smith, Mr. [A. J.] Hacking, Mr. Scott, Miss [Mary Payne] Giles, and Mr. Hird.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Later, Mr. Wilson came to aid as secretary general (if my memory serves me
                    well). Doubtless somewhere in the archives of the College may be found the names of the first
                    teachers and the courses they offered.</p>
            <p>Besides giving a course in English history,<hi rend="sup">11</hi> in which references were often made
                    to American institutions, I took charge of organizing the correspondence school, with the heroic
                    assistance of Miss Giles. It was our hope thereby not only to serve young labor people who could not
                    come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> but also to discover talents through correspondence, so to speak. Before the Spring of
                    1899 came, we had a number of men in residence, several night students from the city of <placeName>

                    sentiments in this respect. But in time we felt that we had to decide whether to fix our home for

                    conclusion in the Spring of 1902 that it was "now or never," that we
                    "belonged" at home. So, in April or May of that year, we sailed on the <hi rend="i">Campania</hi> for the New World, wiser for our happy experiences in <placeName>

            <p>The letters were written to Thomas Edgar Garvin, 1826–1912, who was a prominent lawyer of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the 1850's. The friendship between Denby and Garvin lasted throughout their

                                    deprived me of some days of your society, I hope you found it pleasant. My own
                                    journey to Peking was attended with no remarkable incident, and was altogether
                                    agreeable. I was received in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> and his Court were at Hiroshima, so I missed some Court festivities.
                                    The Secretary of State regretted this circumstance. No where in my absence, either
                                    at home or abroad, did I meet with such genial hospitality as your own. No where was

                                    great deal to restore me to health. I cannot too earnestly thank Mrs Garvin and
                                    yourself, and Cunningham, Edgar, Dunkerson, Morris, and their dear wives, for their

                        <p>It goes without saying that since I arrived I have been a prominent actor in the

                                    and roll in presents, but, unfortunately, or otherwise, I can take nothing from <placeName>

                                    </placeName> except her empty thanks. A man of your well known
                                    benevolence—having attained a position in which you no longer care to cut
                                    into a "fund"—will clearly appreciate the pleasure it
                                    gives me to practice high international law with two great countries for
                                    charity—and <hi rend="i">nary</hi> fee in sight!</p>
                        <p>Long ere you read these lines you will know the result of the labors of which you
                                    have now the inside. If peace comes I made it—if war goes on I have done
                                    my best to stop it. <placeName>

                                    and then I wired <placeName>

                                    </placeName>'s agent. I have made history all alone, and I hope I have made
                                    fame. Whatever betides I shall always find my chief delight in the society of you
                                    and yours.</p>

                        <p>When I got your letter—which is the second, I think, you ever sent
                                    me—I was struck with the similarity of ideas to those expressed in mine.</p>
                        <p>You spoke of the employment of myself as negotiator between <placeName>
                                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                                    </placeName> almost in the same tone as I wrote thereof. I have often noticed that
                                    when after a long interval one writes to a friend he writes at the same time and the
                                    letters cross each other, but I have, also, often noticed that nothing of the kind
                                    happens.</p>
                        <p>It is quite natural that the same causes should operate on two persons apart from
                                    each other at the same time. I have sometimes tried to put the thing to practical
                                    uses and have always failed. However, I hope that this theory or some other will
                                    induce you to write again and often.</p>
                        <p>I have twice brought the two oriental nations [together] after very great and
                                    annoying labor. The first time the Chinese deceived me by substituting their own
                                    letters patent for those that I had prepared. The second time I took the precaution
                                    to wire to <placeName>
                                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                                    </placeName> copies of the letters in Chinese and English—and when they
                                    made some slight objections to the verbiage I wired them amended as suggested in the
                                    two languages. I hope Li Hung Chang<hi rend="sup">5</hi> will stick and that peace
                                    will result.</p>
                        <p>In many ways war annoys the foreigners in the Far East. My colleagues—all
                                    but one—have marines here. I have not brought mine up from Tientsin.
                                    Should the Japanese march on Peking I will order up marines to
                                    protect—not myself particularly—but the seventy or so
                                    Americans—men women and children who are at Peking. Our danger will come
                                    if at all from disbanded soldiers. Mean time Peking is perfectly quiet. A company of
                                    Chinese soldiers armed with spears and swords are at my gate—but they
                                    would probably run from a mob. I have received many thanks from the Chinese
                                    Government—among them an autographic letter from the
                                    Emperor—and much commendation from the foreigners for my efforts for
                                    peace. Several erroneous despatches by wire have been sent from Peking as to my
                                    utterances. Discredit all such—I wire nobody but the Dept and I do not
                                    talk. Love to all.</p>

                    </placeName> County was no longer the focal point in central Indiana that it had been during the
                    first years following its formation in 1819, when many residents of the surrounding area had to go
                    there to obtain their marriage licenses. In the March, 1956, issue marriages from the first record
                    book (1819–1822) were printed; the June issue contained the marriages from Book A
                    (1823–1826); while in the present issue marriages from the first 221 pages of Book B
                    (1825–1833) are printed. Although the dates of Books A and B overlap there does not seem
                    to be any duplication of names. Persons using the series should watch for variant spellings of
                    family names. Book B is the first in which the pages are numbered.</p>

                    Giddens. (<placeName>

            <p>In the past twelve months nearly a dozen books have been published on various aspects of the
                    petroleum industry, several of them major works by mature scholars. The range of these studies
                    encompasses almost every phase of the industry, from the history of individual units and
                    oil-producing regions to specialized monographs dealing with the economics of oil production,
                    distribution, marketing, and transportation. The result of this major addition to our knowledge of
                    the development, structure, and operation of one of the world's leading industries has
                    caused historians, economists, and educated laymen generally to pause and reappraise some of their
                    long-accepted views on the growth of the industry and its relationship to the operation of the
                    American and world economies. One of the works which will contribute materially to our knowledge of
                    the American oil industry is Paul H. Giddens' history of the <hi rend="i">Standard Oil
                        Company (Indiana).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a notably comprehensive record of a major mid-western industrial enterprise. Though the theme
                    is the growth of a business, Giddens' concept of business history is far from a narrow one.
                    There is valuable material here for the social, political, and economic historian as well as for the
                    specialist in business and entrepreneurial history. Indeed, some specialists may question the wisdom
                    of having included so much that is not specifically the primary domain of the business historian.
                    Although everyone may not agree with the author's choice of material and allocation of
                    space, everyone will profit from reading this work carefully.</p>
            <p>Organized in 1889 as a manufacturer of refined petroleum products for the Standard Oil combination,
                    Standard of Indiana continued almost exclusively in this capacity until the 1892 reorganization of
                    the Standard Oil Trust. One of the immediate effects upon the Indiana company of this regrouping of
                    interests was to increase the company's capital <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-052-3-084"/> stock,
                    thus facilitating its acquisition of several companies with marketing agencies in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> , <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and northeastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. From that time until 1911, when the Standard Oil combination was dissolved by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Supreme Court, Standard of Indiana experienced a period of remarkable growth and rapid
                    expansion. At the time of the Trust's dissolution the Indiana company owned three
                    refineries and marketing facilities representing investments of $11,725,000.00 and
                    $7,956,508.32 respectively, but it did not own one piece of crude oil-producing land or
                    any pipeline facilities.</p>
            <p>The history of Indiana Standard since 1911 is largely the story of physical growth, corporate
                    expansion, and functional diversification. By mid-twentieth century the Company had become a great,
                    almost totally integrated oil company "engaged in every phase of the oil business from
                    drilling wild cat wells to selling gasoline."</p>
            <p>In the limited space available here it is impossible even to begin to cite the many fresh insights
                    and acute observations which Giddens sets down on internal corporate changes, industrial
                    developments, and public policies. What was the actual effect of the 1911 dissolution upon the
                    constituent companies? How was separation achieved? What problems did it involve? To what extent
                    were the former members of the combination "independent" after 1911? Why did
                    "active competition" among the newly independent companies take so long to
                    materialize? These are just a few of the important questions that are raised and answered in this
                    book. Heretofore much of the evidence on such questions as these was incomplete, and the commonly
                    accepted explanations not always based upon careful research. By judicious use of private company
                    sources and the extant public record, Giddens supplies, often for the first time, a more complete,
                    certainly more realistic, understanding to many of these long-debated questions.</p>
            <p>One of the more interesting sections of this history is Giddens' description of early
                    petroleum technology and the role of pure and applied science in the development of the modern
                    industry. The problem of manufacturing Lima crude, "pole cat oil," as it was often
                    called because of its offensive odor, is an example of the author's ability to make a
                    technical <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-052-3-085"/> and complex subject interesting and informative. In
                    discussing the various important technical and scientific innovations in the petroleum industry,
                    Giddens is always careful to avoid technical jargon which can easily confuse the general reader. The
                    style is always lucid, often interesting.</p>
            <p>The new material and interpretations which the author sets forth in this work are of wide import and
                    of vital significance not only to the specialist, but to everyone who is interested in coming as
                    close to the truth as possible. The history of the <hi rend="i">Standard Oil Company (Indiana)</hi>
                    is a good example of the important information that can be derived from a judicious and
                    discriminating use of a large collection of private papers, augmented and checked by a careful
                    survey and evaluation of the public record.</p>
            <p>Giddens has written a careful and detailed account of the second largest oil company and the fourth
                    largest manufacturing corporation in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Within these pages there is much valuable information on many of the problems and
                    issues involved in the administration of a large corporation. Certain of these are treated more
                    fully than others. It is difficult, for example, to get a clear picture of the various financial
                    policies employed over the years and their total effect upon the expansion of the business. Costs,
                    profits, and the employment of capital resources are not always clearly set down. More tables and
                    charts graphically pointing out such matters would have been very helpful. Although the author is
                    careful to indicate how much Standard of Indiana's success resulted from the high quality
                    of its management, the evolution and formulation of long-range policy is often not readily apparent.
                    While labor relations in the oil industry have been far more tranquil than in many others, the
                    reason for this might have been more fully developed. But these are minor criticisms, and are in no
                    wise meant to detract from the overall high quality of this work. Most readers will find what they
                    are looking for in this book. The combination of a fascinating story and a felicitous pen
                    disciplined by careful research has produced a good book well worth the reader's time.</p>

            <p>This is a study of one aspect of free enterprise. Professor Allan G. Bogue has written the first
                    full-scale account of the western farm mortgage business in five states during the last decades of
                    the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>The sources in the bibliography presage the achievement in the monograph. A fair-minded picture of
                    the eastern investor has been presented (pp. 7–75). Equally balanced and even more vivid
                    is the picture of the middleman (pp. 77–204). But the farmer who actually used the money
                    shares his fewer pages with the analysis of two townships and remains a shadowy figure (pp.
                    205–261). Unfortunately this part of the study was made without the representative
                    personalities that gave a sympathetic understanding of the investor and middleman.</p>
            <p>During the period studied by Professor Bogue, in fact until the federal government regulation after
                    1932, in spite of state laws to regulate there were enough unscrupulous men engaged in loaning money
                    that all in the business suffered in reputation. Fortunately the author has centered his study on
                    the men with ability and character who are the main support of any constructive activity.</p>
            <p>Investors, such as John and Ira Davenport, loaned their own money and made repayment a main aim. The
                    rates of interest, analyzed in four tables, were 10 per cent to 17 per cent before 1879; moreover
                    there were such additional costs to the borrower as the commission. As would be expected, there were
                    numerous foreclosures; but later, when the rate dropped to 7 per cent, foreclosures practically
                    ceased. Legal rates, expenses, risks, competition, and what the borrower was able to pay set the
                    rates. Money was loaned for from one to five years to finance not more than one-third of the value
                    of such investments as livestock, equipment, and land; or to tide over bad times. Much depended upon
                    the character of the man to whom the loan was made and the purpose was to help him as well as to
                    have a return on the money loaned. Foreclosure was a last resort, sometimes with a low return of 2.5
                    per cent on the investment.</p>
            <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-052-3-087"/>
            <p>The middleman, who was represented in this study by J. B. Watkins, had to be able to serve both
                    investors and borrowers. Funds were obtained both in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. One of the ways investors were located was through the religious press; newspapers and
                    agents were also used. Emphasis was placed on rising land values, the policy that loans should not
                    exceed one-third of the value of the property, the policy that loans were made only to resident
                    farmers for productive purposes, and, sometimes, the guarantee of interest and principal by Watkins.
                    Borrowers were located by newspapers, circulars, and agents. The agents, who received a commission,
                    also made the important inspection to evaluate the risk. For it helped to secure the business if
                    rates were lower than those of competitors, and this meant that in order to make money the security
                    had to be good. Drought, distance, unfavorable publicity, inspection of land titles, adjusting
                    rates, and fraud by both agents and borrowers tested the ability of the middleman. Violent
                    competition resulted in incorporation in 1883 and then a period with substantial surplus.
                    Nevertheless, spreading interests over too wide an area, purchasing too much land, and depression
                    resulted in receivership for the Watkins Land Company in 1894. Watkins was not dishonest but used
                    the provisions of the law to save part of his fortune.</p>
            <p>The last two chapters show the use made of credit in two townships. Probably of most interest to
                    Hoosiers will be the possible application of this method to their townships.</p>
            <p>The summary gives a convenient statement of the welcome contribution of Professor Bogue. Future
                    studies should give more attention to what has often been considered the main weakness of the
                    mortgage system before the Federal Land Banks in 1916: the failure to provide for a gradual paying
                    of loans over a reasonable period.</p>

            <p>This is a comprehensive and scholarly study of the emergence and development of the national union in
                    the latter half of the nineteenth and early years of the twentieth <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-052-3-088"/> century. Professor Ulman examines the forces which gave rise to the
                    national union and which conditioned the development of its structure, governing institutions, and
                    economic policies. From a detailed analysis of the constitutions, convention proceedings, and
                    journals of five national unions he presents a graphic account of how these unions, through a
                    process of trial and error, worked out acceptable solutions to the many problems which accompanied
                    the formation of a national union.</p>
            <p>The study is divided into seven parts. In Part I a survey is made of important historical and
                    economic developments during the latter half of the nineteenth century which influenced the growth
                    and structure of the trade union movement. Professor Ulman singles out for examination the following
                    factors: (1) immigration, (2) the extension of markets, (3) innovation, (4) the big firm, and (5)
                    business conditions. Ulman feels that Common's theory that the expansion of markets was
                    primarily responsible for the growth and character of trade unions requires amplification.
                    "Specifically, it fails to account for the absence of national unions in some industries
                    which had national markets" and it "also fails to account for the presence of
                    national unions in industries which did not have national markets." (p. 45).</p>
            <p>In Part II Ulman shows how (in the absence of a national market for products) the existence of a
                    national market for labor proved, in fact, to be a sufficient cause for the rise of national unions.
                    He finds that during the period in which the first national unions emerged the geographic mobility
                    of labor was economically more important in terms of the geographic range of its effectiveness and
                    the percentage of the working population engaged in migratory activity than in preceding periods or
                    in more recent times. Though local unions were reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the
                    increased geographic mobility of labor, it posed certain inescapable problems which could only be
                    handled by a national union.</p>
            <p>Part III is concerned with the extension of national authority over the initiation and conduct of
                    strikes. Ulman finds that while the presence of a national fund was in some cases sufficient to
                    bring about national control over strikes, this was not always the case. Other factors such as
                    skill, the nature of the market, benefits, the age and date of formation of the national union, and
                    the scope of employer relations <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-052-3-089"/> were important, not only in the
                    extension of national control over strikes but in the establishment of strike funds.</p>
            <p>Part IV deals with the evolution of the governing institutions of the early national unions. As a
                    frame of reference Ulman gives a brief summary of British experience. He then shows how the power
                    and authority of the executive gradually increased with the acquisition of power by the national
                    union. The local unions sought, with little success, to maintain control over the national union and
                    the executive by investing superior powers in various institutions such as the convention of
                    delegates and the executive board, and by providing in some instances for the referendum and the
                    direct election of officers.</p>
            <p>The "foreign affairs" or relationships of the national union with outside
                    organizations are covered in Parts V and VI. Part V deals with jurisdiction and federation. Here
                    Ulman has examined the economic aspects and implications of jurisdiction and the national
                    unions' relations with—and ultimate dominance over—both local and
                    national federations. In Part VI he considers various aspects of the national unions'
                    relations with employers. An examination is made of union attitudes and reactions toward certain
                    employer wage and output practices and of the development of bargaining strategy and policies with
                    reference to strikes, union work rules, national collective bargaining, equal pay, and so forth.</p>
            <p>In Part VII Ulman presents a reappraisal of two leading theories of the labor movement (those of
                    Commons and Perlman), and a sketch of a different hypothesis, in part alternative and in part
                    supplementary to the other theories. He finds both theories inadequate in certain important respects
                    and is particularly critical of Perlman's stress on the "psychology of the working
                    man" in explaining American labor's ultimate choice of collective bargaining.</p>
            <p>In his foreword to this book Professor Sumner S. Slichter points out that, though there have been
                    excellent histories of particular national unions and good studies of different aspects of union
                    government and selected union policies, there has been lacking a comprehensive study such as this.
                    He feels that Ulman's study "will quickly win recognition as one of the most
                    competent and distinguished books on American industrial relations." (p. x). Professor

            <p>During the past few years British historians have been engaged in a publishing project "to
                    make generally accessible a wide selection of the fundamental sources of English history."
                    Under the general editorship of David C. Douglas, <hi rend="i">English Historical Documents</hi>
                    will cover in thirteen volumes the years from Anglo-Saxon times down to the beginning of World War
                    I. The four volumes under review are the only ones that have already been published. In setting
                    forth the aim of the series, the general editor notes that there has been a tremendous accumulation
                    of primary historical materials over the past fifty years in many scattered periodicals and volumes.
                    Oftentimes the student and the non-specialist scholar have had difficulty in obtaining these
                    authorities. There is need, therefore, for a large-scale series that will bring together in one
                    place a "comprehensive corpus of evidence" relating to specific historical
                    periods.</p>
            <p>The large scope of the series (the four volumes thus far published range from 867 to 1014 pages)
                    makes it possible to print the documents in full wherever it is feasible to do so. In this respect
                    the series differs from traditional source books which often contain only brief extracts of key
                    documents. Another basic feature is the sketching of the main outlines of the period covered by each
                    volume in a general introduction and the inclusion of shorter introductions for particular groups of
                    documents. One of the very useful features of the series is the inclusion of selected annotated
                    bibliographies which accompany the introductions.</p>
            <p>In the case of Volumes I and II the editorial tasks have been particularly demanding. This is true
                    because numerous Anglo-Saxon, Latin, or Old French texts, normally incomprehensible <pb n="307" id="VAA4025-052-3-091"/> to many readers because of the language barrier, have been given fresh
                    and authoritative translations. For example, approximately two hundred pages of Volume I have been
                    allotted to the translations by editor Dorothy Whitelock of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and
                    Bede's <hi rend="i">Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation.</hi> In Volume II, which
                    is mainly concerned with the causes and consequences of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> Conquest, similar extensive translations of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, as well as the
                    Domesday Book, are provided. In addition, a forty-page pictorial representation of the Bayeux
                    tapestry has been wisely included in this volume. Such heavy reliance as this upon a few lengthy
                    contemporary accounts, supplemented by many shorter documents, distinguishes Volumes I and II from
                    Volumes VIII and IX. No such preponderance of any one document is apparent in Volume VIII, edited by
                    Andrew Browning and covering the later Stuart period. This is perhaps an indication of the greater
                    number and richer variety of materials which have become available to scholars in the early modern
                    period.</p>
            <p>The Browning volume deals primarily with Restoration institutions: the monarchy, Parliament, and the
                    church as well as the revolutionary settlement following 1688. The great variety of historical
                    materials, plus the age's penchant for character sketching, make it possible to present
                    some leading personalities as they were viewed by their contemporaries such as Gilbert Burnet, John
                    Dryden, John Evelyn, and Samuel Pepys. Quite properly, a rather lengthy section is devoted to public
                    finance, for this was the fundamental dilemma which plagued the Stuarts throughout the century and
                    allowed disaffected religious elements to make known their grievances in Parliament. Another section
                    on trade and plantations conspicuously avoids documents referring to the American colonies except
                    for a few parliamentary statutes such as the Navigation Act of 1660. The reason behind this
                    editorial decision was to eliminate duplication, for this volume is one of three (the other two
                    being the forthcoming Volumes VII, <hi rend="i">1603–1660</hi>, and X, <hi rend="i">1714–1783)</hi> which will chronologically parallel the one volume in the series
                    solely devoted to American colonial development from Jamestown to the Declaration of Independence.</p>
            <p>Volume IX, <hi rend="i">American Colonial Documents to 1776</hi>, edited by the project's
                    lone American historian, Merrill Jensen, <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-052-3-092"/> will be of particular
                    interest to teachers and students of the American colonial period. Apart from the introductions and
                    bibliographies, the book is divided into eight major sections which tend to stress political and
                    economic factors more than social and intellectual forces. They are (1) the foundation of the
                    English colonies, (2) the evolution of colonial governments, (3) the economic development, (4)
                    population and labor, (5) religion and education, (6) expansion and social discontent, (7) British
                    colonial policies and the growth of colonial opposition, 1763–1773, and (8) the coming of
                    the War for American Independence, 1773–1776. The documents themselves, 179 in number,
                    are arranged chronologically under topical sub-sections of each of the eight major sections. This
                    organizational principle is on the whole quite satisfactory and consistently followed. However, the
                    editor decided to subsume under other unrelated topics the various plans for colonial union which
                    occurred at widely divergent times. For example, the Galloway Plan of Union (1774) is adequately
                    treated under "The First Continental Congress" and the Dominion of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> (1688) under "British Policy and Colonial Government." This
                    organization may account for the omission in the volume of two plans for colonial union: the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> Confederation (1643) and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Plan of Union (1754).</p>
            <p>Inevitably, this volume will be compared with existing collections of colonial material such as the
                    relevant pages of Henry S. Commager's <hi rend="i">Documents in American History</hi>,
                    Samuel E. Morison's <hi rend="i">Sources and Documents Illustrating the American
                        Revolution, 1764–1788</hi>, and such specialized collections as Miller and Johnson,
                        <hi rend="i">The Puritans.</hi> Most of the important documents in the Commager book have been
                    included in the Jensen volume except for the Quebec Act of 1774. Although the Morison collection
                    contains only about one-half as much material as Jensen's for the period
                    1763–1776, nevertheless the former contains excerpts from some important pamphlet
                    material which the latter does not. Some of these tracts, among the finest examples of colonial
                    political thought, are the <hi rend="i">Letters from a Farmer in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                        </placeName> to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies</hi>, James Otis' <hi rend="i">The Rights of the Colonies Asserted and Proved</hi>, and James Wilson's <hi rend="i">Considerations on the Nature and Extent of the Legislative Authority of the British
                    Parliament.</hi> The <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-052-3-093"/> Morison volume, then, remains useful as a
                    supplement to this new book. This is even more true of the Miller and Johnson volume on Puritanism.
                    Professor Jensen does include a very brief extract from Roger Williams' <hi rend="i">The
                        Bloudy Tenent, of Persecution</hi>, which is a unique and important contribution to early
                    American political thought. However, it is not at all representative of the federal covenant
                    theology of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> Puritanism, of which there is no representative selection. And yet to have included all
                    of these omissions would have meant editing another volume.</p>
            <p>A large number of the documents printed in the Jensen volume have been published in historical
                    collections before. In most cases the editor has chosen to reprint these texts rather than obtain
                    microfilms of the originals. Certainly, in the case of some manuscripts, there would be little point
                    in repeating, for example, the recent fine editing by Julian Boyd of the Declaration of Independence
                    or Morison's <hi rend="i">Of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                        </placeName> Plantation 1620–1647</hi> by William Bradford. Yet some of the printed
                    documents, both pamphlet literature and official papers, were edited many years ago—a
                    few, more than a hundred years ago—and by much less distinguished editors. On the other
                    hand, a small portion of the material, primarily dealing with the economic development of the
                    colonies, has been taken directly from the manuscript collections of the Public Record Office and
                    Her Majesty's Stationery Office. Included in these documents are about twenty pages of
                    statistical tables on colonial commerce.</p>
            <p>No two historians, of course, can agree on the same documents to be included in a work of such
                    magnitude as this one. Some would put more stress on relations with the Indians; others would omit
                    trade statistics. In the main, however, most of the important documents are included, and this
                    volume will be indispensable for the colonial historian. Indeed, the whole series, when it is
                    finally completed, will be, despite its high cost, a distinct contribution to English and American
                    historical studies if only because of the convenience of having the important documents assembled in
                    one place.</p>

            <p>Paul M. Angle has certainly succeeded in producing a unique work; namely, a history of a historical
                    society which is witty, readable, and, at the same time, informative and factually accurate. He has
                    accomplished this result by a skillful selection of letters, documents, and news clippings which he
                    allows to speak for themselves, with but brief introductions and comments. It is a work of stark
                    impressionism, done with broad strokes and in vivid colors. In consequence, it communicates to the
                    reader a sense of identification with events in the life of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> which no dry chronological record of the minutiae of society records could possibly
                    accomplish. It stimulates the imagination of the reader to cooperate with the author to amplify his
                    pungent comments. There is a laugh on nearly every page.</p>
            <p>Of course, no one could tell the tale of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Historical Society in the first century of its life (1856–1956) without

                    </placeName> history in this fabulous era when <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was transformed from a crude trading village set in a wilderness to a mighty
                    metropolis; the true capital of the Middle West; the financial center of the richest empire the
                    world has even known; and a formidable cultural and educational venture.</p>
            <p>The only astonishing phenomenon is that, considering the vast effort necessarily expended in this
                    century by the citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the material realm, they had energy left to cultivate the arts and foresight to
                    document their history in the making by supporting so generously their historical society and
                    accumulating the documents, letters, books, and records which perpetuate their experiences.</p>
            <p>In the great <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> fires of 1871 and 1874 the Society's building and all of its original
                    collections were destroyed, including two thousand volumes of sermons with which the more pious
                    early inhabitants seem to have endowed the library. But the Society arose from the ashes, and in the
                    ensuing seventy-five years has accumulated a distinguished library and collection of invaluable
                    historical source material contained in a beautiful building of noble proportions, in <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-052-3-095"/> which likewise is housed a museum which displays &amp; visual

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s history. The vigilance of the Society's officers is to be
                    commended, particularly in their solicitation in 1882 of a gift of the Lincoln papers then in the
                    custody of Robert Todd Lincoln, who, in his reply to the Society (August 27, 1882) made one of the
                    most colossal understatements of all times when he said: " 'In reply to your
                    letter of August 7th respecting the custody of letters and documents received and preserved by my
                    father and mother, I have to say to you that the idea of placing them in the custody of the
                    Historical Society would strike me with favor if there were anything of sufficient consequence to
                    include in such a collection. …' "</p>
            <p>While the Society acquired none of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> papers, we are relieved to learn that it has one of his razors. Amongst its more
                    gruesome artifacts are the bones of John Lalime, one of the earliest settlers of <placeName>

            <p>This is a book designed to attract the general reader. Unfortunately in the writing of history the
                    number of failures to accomplish this task are much more numerous than the successes. When the works
                    of perhaps our greatest literary historian are out of print it seems necessary that new readers
                    should be given the opportunity to sample his writing in the hope that they will beg for more.
                    History need not be dull, as Parkman demonstrates again and again. Samuel E. Morison has selected
                    chapters from Parkman's study of <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-052-3-096"/>
                    <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the New World in an effort to make the era live again in the mind of the reader. In
                    this task he has succeeded admirably.</p>
            <p>Some historians may find fault with Morison's selections but in this reader's
                    opinion the choices are excellent. The continuity of the volume is remarkable. One may follow the
                    story from the description of the Indian tribes in their native habitat and the coming of the French
                    to the fall of the French at Quebec in 1759. Whole chapters are presented sometimes in sequence
                    rather than excerpts. There is no selection from <hi rend="i">The Conspiracy of Pontiac</hi> but
                    this seems justifiable from the standpoint of the continuity of the story.</p>
            <p>The selections may be divided conveniently into four parts. Group number one includes a description
                    of the early settling. Following the picture of the Indian tribes from <hi rend="i">The Jesuits</hi>
                    one is led to the story of early French exploration and settlement. Individuals such as Champlain
                    seem alive through the magic of Parkman. The role and trials of the Jesuits are vividly illustrated
                    through the story of the martyrdom of Father Jogues. A second division includes selections from <hi rend="i">The Old Regime in <placeName>
                            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> portraying life in the area. Trade, industry, marriage, morals, manners,
                    feudalism, government—all aspects of life in the era are described. From here Morison
                    decided to turn to the westward movement through the eyes of La Salle. All this prepares the reader
                    for the final story of the struggle for control of North America between the French and the English.
                    The sack of Deer field, the siege of Louisbourg, and the battle on the plains of Abraham are all
                    epic narratives of this contest. Parkman's scholarship, imagination, and literary qualities
                    make this a thrilling presentation that grips and holds the attention of the reader.</p>
            <p>These chapters are preceded by an exceedingly interesting introduction by the editor.
                    Morison's admiration and defense of Parkman is evident yet he presents a clear picture of
                    the historian and the man. An interesting description of Parkman in 1871 written by
                    l'Abbé Casgrain is included. Many of Parkman's notes are omitted since
                    the book is designed for the general reader, but Morison has added some of his own, including
                    corrections of fact and summaries of new research and conclusions. The bibliography includes an
                    account of the various editions of Parkman's works and a summary of the sales of these
                    volumes.</p>

                    (Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice Hall, Inc., 1956, pp. ix, 358. Preface and illustrations.
                    $5.00).</head>
            <p>This volume will appeal to the general reader because it is a typical success story and deals with an
                    activity that involves practically all consumers of food. The historian will be interested for an
                    additional reason since the book will be one more addition to the list of volumes dealing with
                    American business institutions and their founders.</p>
            <p>The personal record of William K. Kellogg is presented in an interesting and forthright narrative and
                    the author, while treating his subject with understanding and sympathy, does not hesitate to point
                    out the limitation of this self-made "rugged individualist." Powell underlines
                    some of the faults of William K. Kellogg by telling the story of his estrangement from a brother, a
                    son, and a grandson. His older brother, John Harvey Kellogg, won fame as the founder of the Battle
                    Creek Sanitarium and the promoter of health foods. William, who began his successful career as an
                    aid to the widely known John Harvey Kellogg, soon broke with him on questions of policy. The younger
                    brother by virtue of a court decision was permitted to use the Kellogg name in his advertising.</p>
            <p>It was with the caption: "The Original Has This Signature—W. K. Kellogg"
                    that the great advertising campaign of corn flakes was launched. William K. must be credited with
                    sound judgment in the use of advertising, but he never displayed equally sound judgment in
                    recognizing his brother's important, if unwilling, contribution to the popularity of the
                    trade name. William K. Kellogg's estrangement from his son and his grandson underlines a
                    quality of willfulness that seems to mark many self-made men. As an employer he had a high sense of
                    loyalty to his workers and dealt justly with them but the relationship never developed into one of
                    personal friendship. Even his immediate aids and advisors never penetrated the barrier caused by an
                    apparently conscious desire to keep all "employees in awe of him."</p>
            <p>In his last twenty-five years W. K. Kellogg turned his attention to philanthropy and established a
                    foundation "for improving the health, happiness and well being of children and
                    youth." This part of the story is told with sympathy and understanding in the final
                    chapters of the book. Those <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-052-3-098"/> readers interested in more details
                    can find them in <hi rend="i">The First Twenty-five Years—W. K. Kellogg Foundation
                        1930–1955</hi>, published in Battle Creek, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in 1955.</p>
            <p>Powell gives only brief attention to the relation of the Kellogg organization to other companies or
                    to the retail phase of the business. An unpublished history of the company, which the author lists
                    in his "Acknowledgement," would probably fill this gap.</p>
            <p>The book is written in simple and direct style, the text is excellent, and the illustrations are well
                    selected. The author indicates that the work was designed for the general public, but this
                    explanation does not satisfy the scholar's need for an index and bibliography.</p>

            <p>In every presidential election year the American people have campaign documents of various types
                    through which they can become acquainted with the candidates and issues of the campaign. When the
                    President seeks another term, he naturally runs on his record. Merlo J. Pusey's <hi rend="i">Eisenhower the President</hi> is a campaign document but a first-rate one. The author,
                    who won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Charles Evans Hughes, knows how to tell a story. He
                    has a readable style and in the Eisenhower administration he has a story worth telling.</p>
            <p>The present regime in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> is pictured as one of clean politics and fair play and is contrasted with the dirty
                    politics and foul play of the Democratic administrations. Although the author does not admit it,
                    both of our major parties have their honest leaders and their corrupt spokesmen. When the reader has
                    finished <hi rend="i">Eisenhower the President</hi>, he should turn to the May issue of <hi rend="i">Harper's Magazine</hi> and read Warren Unna's article, "Republican
                    'Give-aways': The Charges and the Facts." The contrast is appalling.</p>
            <p>"Probably no President," says Pusey, "has ever done more than Eisenhower
                    to promote good causes, to help people in distress, to cheer the victims of misfortune, or to lift
                    the general morale of the people." (p. 99). Evidently, the return <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-052-3-099"/> to work of about one-third of our employables beginning in 1933 was
                    forgotten. Much will be made in the ensuing campaign of Republican prosperity. One looks in vain in
                    this book for any mention of approximately 30 per cent decrease in farmers' income since
                    1952 and for any indication of the more than 40 per cent increase in little business failures in the
                    same time. These facts may presage trouble ahead.</p>
            <p>In foreign affairs the difference between the Taft and Eisenhower wings of the Republican party is
                    labelled as merely "differences of degree," whereas the contrast was fundamentally
                    that between isolationists and cooperationists. Nowhere, perhaps, in Mr. Pusey's book is
                    his thesis of Republican "light" contrasted with Democratic
                    "darkness" more obvious than in his treatment of Dulles and his predecessor
                    Acheson. When Dulles became Secretary of State Acheson had already hurled the unfortunate South
                    Koreans to the Communist wolves. Dulles, however, "with a fabulous store of knowledge and
                    wisdom," is pictured as having prodigious energy and a superb technique in deflating the
                    Soviet bluster. Such is the nature of this campaign document. Certainly, the author would not
                    contend that he has written an objective book. As Republican campaign propaganda it is excellent.
                    Otherwise it has no reison <hi rend="i">d'être.</hi>

            <p>This brief history of Indiana Central College, located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was written at the request of its Golden Anniversary Committee. The material is
                    divided into five sections: The Origin and Growth, 1902–1905; Building Period,
                    1915–1930; Progress, 1931–1944; The New Era, 1944–1955; In
                    Retrospect. Within each section the author discusses such topics as administration, departments and
                    faculty, and student life.</p>
            <p>Indiana Central College is one of the younger church-related institutions of the state. Founded by
                    the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, the college was incorporated in 1902 and its doors were
                    opened to students in 1905. Higher <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-052-3-100"/> education was not new to the
                    church, however, for Otterbein College in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> had been established in 1847. The author also states that the "institutions
                    which might be considered predecessors of Indiana Central were <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Roanoke</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bourbon Seminaries, North <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, and Hartsville College." (p. 3).</p>
            <p>The struggles of Indiana Central are typical of the small college with inadequate financial support.
                    Not infrequently statements such as these are found: "By 1912 the college required a
                    substantial loan in order that it might continue." (p. 15). "It was voted that the
                    teachers would be paid … in cash or in notes with six per cent interest." (p.
                    19). Such an entry is found frequently in the minutes of the Executive Committee. "On
                    December 30, 1915, Indiana Central College was $80,000 in debt." (p. 27).
                    "By 1920 the campaign had succeeded in gaining pledges totaling $333,000.
                    Unfortunately … a considerable number of the pledges in this campaign and subsequent
                    campaigns were just promises and nothing more." (p. 28). In 1931, $190,000 were
                    borrowed at 6 per cent interest.</p>
            <p>A better day came, however, following World War II. In 1945 the last of the mortgage indebtedness of
                    the school was paid off, and the merger of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ with the
                    Evangelical Church was helpful in providing better support. In 1947 the college was accredited by
                    the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The campus has grown from eight
                    acres to fifty-nine, and building facilities have expanded accordingly. Starting with seventy-four,
                    student enrollment now not infrequently reaches the five hundred mark. Of the thirty-two full-time
                    faculty members, about half of them have the doctor's degree. Throughout the years, the
                    purpose of the college—that of providing an institution of higher learning in a Christian
                    atmosphere—has remained.</p>
            <p>This reviewer has little to offer in the way of adverse criticism. To say that here and there the
                    English could have been improved is merely to say what is true of much writing. Some questions that
                    may arise in the reader's mind are not answered, but the work cannot be judged as a full or
                    definitive history for it was not intended to be such. Very little, if anything, is said, for
                    instance, about religious problems which the school might have had on the campus or in its <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-052-3-101"/> relation with the supporting church, and one wonders whether
                    these were inconsequential.</p>
            <p>The author and Indiana Central College are to be congratulated for publishing this work, brief though
                    it is. Our church-related colleges have made an invaluable contribution to American civilization,
                    and historians and others will welcome this additional contribution to our cultural history.</p>

            <p>Any history of a denominational college is the history of a group of dedicated people. The story of
                    the growth and development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> College is no exception, as shown in this book written by a retired faculty member of
                    the school. Author Umble traces the patterns of the college's life from 1894 through 1954.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> Institute with only a few of its students high school graduates, with a shifting
                    student population, and always with problems of finance. For years, another of its major problems
                    was the question of its relationship to its conservative sponsor, the Mennonite church. Gradually,
                    the various difficulties worked themselves toward solution as the college gained both denominational
                    and lay recognition as an institution worthy of support.</p>
            <p>As is usual in such cases, the support never equaled the demands; nevertheless the school moved onto
                    firm and stable footings. Leadership made this possible: President Byers, Hartzler, Kauffman, Yoder,
                    and Miller are but a few of the men to be remembered. Underpaid and overworked faculty members,
                    devoting their lives to the ideals of the college, should also be listed in full, for without their
                    services the present strong and influential educational institution could not have developed. They
                    have nobly served under the college motto: "Culture for Service."</p>
            <p>The use of footnotes and citations, and the organization of material in this book may disturb the
                    professional historian. Still, the work is adequate for the lay person for <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-052-3-102"/> whom it is intended. It is sure to be a source of great pride and
                    warmth to those who have personal associations with this school.</p>
