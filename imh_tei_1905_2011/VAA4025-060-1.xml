                    </placeName>. That acute observer of the national scene, Theodore Roosevelt, watched with growing
                    alarm the multiplying signs of unrest. "The dull, purblind folly of the very rich men;
                    their greed and arrogance … and the corruption in business and politics," the
                    chief executive complained to Secretary of War William Howard Taft in March, 1906, "have
                    tended to produce a very unhealthy condition of excitement and irritation in the popular
                        mind…."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Even Congress responded to the new temper of
                    the country. The first session of the Fifty-ninth Congress witnessed the adoption of three
                    epoch-making pieces of legislation: the Hepburn Act, the Pure Food and Drug Law, and the Meat
                    Inspection Act. These laws, a perceptive newspaperman observed, represented "a radical
                    departure from previous governmental methods. In each case there is a marked tendency toward the
                    centralization of power in the <placeName>

                            upon the author's research. For a documented account, see John Braeman,
                            "Albert J. neveridge: From Imperialism to Progressivism" (Ph.D.

                    <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-060-1-006"/> The turmoil of the 1890's—the bloody strikes,
                    the lengthening bread lines, the free-silver heresy—had left an indelible impress upon
                    his mind. "This is the hour," he had lamented to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Union League Club on Washington's Birthday, 1895, "of
                    opinions unsettled, of vagaries abounding, of lawlessness infecting the very air we
                        breathe."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The election of 1896, Beveridge thought, marked a
                    turning point in the nation's history. Should the silver-tainted Democracy win, he feared
                    there would be no safety for property, no security for person. "Elect Bryan," he
                    warned his fellow countrymen, "and reap the harvest of destruction, drink the wine of
                    dissolution and tell history that we are another one of liberty's failures, another <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The immediate threat was repulsed. But Beveridge saw grave dangers ahead for the republic. Safety lay
                    in looking outward—in joining the race for empire underway around the globe. Overseas
                    expansion was indispensable to revive prosperity. Without new markets abroad for the surplus of
                    factory and farm, he warned, America faced a grim future of ever worsening depression culminating in
                    revolutionary upheaval. No less vital was the psychological fillip the country would receive from a
                    boldly expansive policy. War was "the divine instrument of progress" that would
                    break down the walls that had grown between classes and restore the discipline wanted for national
                        greatness.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The Spanish-American War more than fulfilled these hopes. With
                    the outbreak of hostilities came that national solidarity for which Beveridge longed. "It
                    is an hour," he rejoiced, "when men who thought they hated one another at the
                    ballot-box will find that they love one another on the battle-field. It is an hour when a master
                    event has found and struck the key-note of harmony between labor and capital."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>The American people had gone to war supposedly to free <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName>. But a few saw beyond the immediate event. "The first gun of our war for
                    civilization," Beveridge told a cheering audience two days after the formal declaration of
                    war, "will be also the morning gun of the new day in the Republic's imperial
                    career." The Hoosier politician pictured for his listeners a string of dependencies
                    "flying our flag" stretching from the Caribbean halfway around the globe to the
                        Philippines.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In the campaign that fall, he fanned the imperialist spirit.
                    There must be no retreat from the Philippines, he cried. "We can not retreat from any soil
                    where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> has unfurled our banner; it is ours to save that soil for liberty and
                        civilization."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The nation, in his opinion, could not escape its
                    destiny; nor could Albert J. Beveridge. "I would," he confessed, "rather
                    take part in organizing our colonial system than to do anything else on this earth." Not
                    the man "to idly sit and witness the procession of events," he ran for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate;<hi rend="sup">10</hi> and his triumph against heavy odds marked him as a
                    political tactician of the first rank and made him overnight a national figure.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his first term in the Senate (1899-1905), Beveridge devoted his major energies to wrestling with
                    the problems of empire—the <placeName>
                  <country>Philippines</country>, <country reg="pr">Puerto Rico</country>
               </placeName>, the isthmian canal, and Far Eastern policy. At home, his
                    overriding concern was to safeguard his position against his party rivals within Indiana led by
                    fellow Senator Charles W. Fairbanks. During the McKinley years, Fairbanks had had the inside track
                    with the White House. But with McKinley's death, the balance shifted as Beveridge jumped on
                    the Roosevelt bandwagon. So ably did he play the political game that he forced his factional rivals
                    to abandon further opposition to his reelection. No issues were at stake; no antagonistic
                    philosophies divided the factions. For Beveridge stood, in his own eyes, as "the most
                    earnest of those who resist demagogical attacks upon property and property
                        rights…."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Beveridge's record during his first term in the Senate—his championship of the
                    protective tariff, his support of the ship subsidy bill, his opposition to the stringent antitrust
                    provisions of the Littlefield bill—marked him as a staunch defender of the time-hallowed
                    planks of the Grand Old Party. Even more reassuring was his repeated warning lest the American
                    people be misled by demagogues preaching class hatred. "The great truth of the
                    hour," he told a bankers' gathering, "is this—the real
                    interest of every American citizen is the true interest of every other American citizen, the
                    ultimate good of any class is the final good of all."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The ruling

                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>—saw in the new Hoosier senator a promising find. Beveridge looked to Allison
                    as an admired guide; and his relationship with Orville Platt was almost that of father and son. In a
                    signal honor for so junior a member, Beveridge was named along with Aldrich, Allison, Spooner, Mark
                    A. Hanna of <placeName>

            <p>But no political leader can afford to lose touch with public sentiment, and Beveridge prided himself
                    on his instinctive knowledge of the aspirations of the man in the street. Despite the sweeping
                    Republican triumph in the 1904 elections, he saw grounds for disquiet. The election represented no
                    popular mandate for the GOP as a party. "The country went Rooseveltian rather than

            <p>Most ominous was the increase in the Socialist vote in 1904. Again the specter of class warfare, even
                    social upheaval, loomed before the republic. His own impulses deeply conservative, Beveridge
                    understood—unlike so many of his fellow Republicans—that unbending
                    standpattism was self-defeating. There were abuses demanding reform; there were grievances wanting
                    relief. Unless the Republican party faced these new problems with the same boldness as its founders
                    had faced the slavery issue, Beveridge feared the end would be disastrous. "We
                    must," he warned the Indiana Republican State Convention in the spring of 1906, <quote rend="blockquote">

                    passed the Hepburn Railroad Rate Act, the Pure Food and Drug Act, and the Meat Inspection Law. In
                    all three fights, Beveridge was on the progressive side. His support of President Theodore Roosevelt
                    in the bitter struggle over the railroad law made him the target of a bitter attack on the floor of
                    the Senate by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Beveridge was instrumental in

                    industrial and social order has developed…." The principle, he explained,
                    "is this: When any business becomes so great that it affects the welfare of all the people
                    it must be regulated by the Goverment of all the people."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    about the impossibility of standing pat. But he saw with dismay how many of his fellow Republican

            <p>That was not for Beveridge. On the stump that fall, he called for an inheritance tax, tariff

                    returns gave further evidence of how the wind was blowing. The Democrats recorded marked gains. Even
                    more alarming was the sharp increase in Socialist activity. "You have no idea", he
                    wrote publisher Frank Munsey, "how profound, intense and permanent the feeling among the
                    American people is that this great reform movement shall go on."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                    There would be no swinging back of the pendulum. "The truth about it is", he told
                    Roosevelt's private secretary, "that this general movement of reform has only
                        begun."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the streams flowing into the ground swell of reform was what Arthur S. Link has called
                    "the social justice movement." In the 1890's appeared the professional
                    social worker and with the professionalization of social work came, as Robert H. Bremner has
                    brilliantly shown, a new approach to poverty. This was "a factual generation."
                    Discarding the traditional shibboleths, the pioneers of "scientific philanthropy"
                    went out and gathered the facts about poverty, its extent and its causes. In light of these facts,
                    the older conception of poverty as a penalty for individual faults was no longer tenable. Poverty
                    was a social phenomenon—the result of circumstances beyond the control of the
                        individual.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> It <list type="footnotes">

                    league's purpose was "to bring the power of consumers to bear upon the improvement
                    of working conditions" through publicity. Consumers were urged to buy only those white
                    goods having the National Consumers' League label as a guarantee that the goods were
                    produced under decent working conditions. But from the beginning the league's members saw
                    that legislation was also needed. Under Mrs. Kelley's leadership, the league engaged in
                    campaigns against tenement sweatshops, starvation wages, excessive hours, and child labor. So
                    widespread was the evil of child labor, and so powerful the interests profiting from its
                    continuance, that Mrs. Kelley decided a separate organization must be set up devoted to the cause.

                    photographed the children at work. The first fruits of the agitation was the adoption of a
                    compromise bill in 1903. The law was a modest one: the age limit was twelve years, a loophole
                    permitted the working of ten-year-olds "to support a dependent parent," and there
                    was no provision for enforcement or inspection. Despite these shortcomings, a beginning had been

                    boasted a membership of almost 400,000 women. The federation's chief objective as listed in
                    its constitution was "literary, artistic, or scientific culture," but with the
                    passage of time the organization spoke ever more loudly upon public affairs. The fourth biennial
                    convention in 1898 unanimously adopted resolutions calling for maximum-hour laws for women and an
                    end to child labor. After the turn of the century, the tempo of the federation's activity
                    upon the child labor front increased. Its Child Labor Committee urged "that every woman in
                    the General Federation should be a 'committee of one' to use all possible
                    influence against anything which dwarfs the minds and bodies of the children." Local clubs
                    set up their own child labor committees, and in state after state, women's clubs
                    spearheaded the fight for more stringent legislation.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>Ever attuned to the public mood, Theodore Roosevelt took up the question. In his annual message of
                    December, 1904, he asked Congress to authorize an investigation by the Bureau of Labor into labor
                    conditions throughout the country and especially into "the conditions of child labor and
                    child-labor legislation in the several States." When Congress failed to act, the chief
                    executive renewed his request the following year.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> When some lawmakers objected
                    that the Census Bureau could handle the job, the President insisted that the bureau was not the
                    proper agency for the task. He did not want a mere collection of statistics, he explained.
                    "I want to have some man who is cool-headed, but who has a genuine knowledge of and

                    Labor, Dr. Charles P. Neill, professor of political economy at Catholic University and a pioneer
                    social worker, was "peculiarly fitted" for the job. But for this very reason, many
                    congressmen balked and no action was taken before the end of the first session of the Fifty-ninth
                    Congress in July, 1906.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

                    by the Bureau of Labor—was insufficient. "The public," the Indiana

                    Congress. A national law, he told the President, was required to deal with this nation-wide evil.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> On the stump that fall, Beveridge called for a national child labor law as a
                    "must" to safeguard the nation's "citizenship." At
                    stake was the national well-being. "We can not," he proclaimed, "permit
                    any man or corporation to stunt the bodies, minds and souls of American children. We can not thus
                    wreck the future of the American Republic."<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mixed motives animated the Indiana lawmaker. He was outraged by the inhumanity of child labor. His
                    own youthful drudgery in the fields and lumber camps paled beside the harsher fate suffered by tens
                    of thousands of children in the crowded factories and sweatshops. As he looked more deeply into the
                    extent of child labor, he reported to Albert Shaw, he found it "even a more serious evil
                    than was supposed." There were tens of thousands of young men and women "whose
                    bodies have been injured, minds have been stunted and whose very souls have been
                    dulled…." Nor were these ills limited to the present generation. Themselves
                    crippled in mind and spirit, these victims of child labor "produce children who are more or
                    less degenerate."<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beveridge was an ambitious man, eager for the spotlight, with his eye on the presidency. Leadership
                    of the fight against child labor promised the popular acclaim he craved.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The
                    dictates of party advantage added their voice. No Republican could wish the Democrats to gain the
                    credit for espousing so popular a measure. "I am holding my breath," he confessed
                    to Roosevelt's private secretary, "for fear of seeing an announcement any day that
                    some Democratic Congressman or Senator will propose just such a law." Even more alarming
                    was the danger that the archdemagogue of the day, William Randolph Hearst, "will beat us to
                    it." The Indiana lawmaker warned that Hearst's "magazines have been
                    making a specialty <list type="footnotes">

            <p>But more than thoughts of partisan advantage moved him. As an American nationalist, the Hoosier
                    senator feared for the republic's future unless action were taken. Let this country take
                    heed from the example of Britain, he warned. The thousands of men found physically unfit during the
                    Boer War showed how child labor had undermined British manhood. With the loss of its virility had
                    come ever more bitter internal discord. Should this country suffer the same fate? Child labor, he
                    saw, breeds "an ever increasing army of haters of society at
                        large…."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Therein lay the gravest threat to American
                    institutions. "When these children grow up and understand how they are ruined for
                    life," he lamented to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspaper publisher John C. Shaffer, "there is developed the classes which we
                    all fear and have reason to fear."<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The individual states, in Beveridge's opinion, could not halt the cancer. Under the existing
                    "clumsy, ineffectual tangle of state statutes," the most progressive state
                    remained at the mercy of unfair competition from the least enlightened one. Only a national law
                    could work.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Beveridge saw no constitutional bar. Even in his most standpat
                    days, he had believed "that whatever may be essential to the development of the
                    people's nationality lies latent in the Constitution's general terms, awaiting the
                    necessity of events to call it into action."<hi rend="sup">60</hi> He conceded that
                    "a federal statute can not be passed directly controlling the factories and mines in the
                    States. That is the province of the States." But the Meat Inspection Act showed the way.
                    That law barred uninspected meats from shipment in interstate commerce. Why not apply the same ban
                    against goods made by child labor? Congress has, the Indiana senator held, "absolute power
                    over the railroads, boats, ships and other agencies of interstate commerce and unlimited powers

            <p>His child labor bill differed from the Meat Inspection Law in one detail. That law had placed federal
                    inspectors in each packing house. But Beveridge realized that a child labor bill providing for
                    on-the-spot federal inspection of nearly every plant throughout the country could never pass
                    Congress. So he tried a different tack. His bill forbade any carrier from transporting in interstate
                    commerce the products of any mine or factory that had not filed an affidavit that no children under
                    fourteen years of age were employed. Stiff penalties were prescribed for violations by the carriers
                    or for the filing of a false affidavit by the factories or mines. Enforcement was left in the hands
                    of the local federal attorneys.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> "There is no question
                    whatever," he told presidential secretary William Loeb, Jr., "about the
                    constitutionality of this law. Neither is there any question about its being practical. Neither is
                    there any question about the fact that it is absolutely the only way we can reach the subject by
                    national statute."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Looking for support, Beveridge turned to the National Child Labor Committee. At a special meeting of
                    its board of trustees on November 23, he appeared in person to explain his bill and ask for the
                    committee's support. After "an animated discussion," the decision was
                    postponed until December 6. A copy of the bill was sent to the full membership of the committee
                    along with a questionnaire asking for "an expression of opinion" for the
                    board's guidance on "what action, if any, should be taken in this matter by the
                    National Committee as a committee."<hi rend="sup">64</hi> On December 5, Beveridge formally

            <p>At the meeting of the board of the National Child Labor Committee on December 6, the discussion was
                    heated. The opposition was led by Robert W. De Forest. A wealthy corporation lawyer turned
                    philanthropist, De Forest was president of the Charity Organization Society of <placeName>

                    without on-the-spot federal inspection. "Practically, every employer would make a
                    certificate, and every carrier would carry, and conditions would remain the
                    same…." There was, he added, "grave doubt about the constitutionality
                    of this bill." Most importantly, De Forest warned that to support federal legislation in a
                    field properly belonging to the states would handicap the committee in its work in the South where
                    the worst child labor abuses were found. "I think," he told the board,
                    "our influence in the South would be seriously impaired by giving our official approval to
                    a measure which many Southerners will think of the Force Bill variety."<hi rend="sup">66</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A resolution to the effect that the committee was not at present ready to endorse any pending bill
                    for federal regulation of child labor was defeated. Thereupon the trustees voted to endorse the
                    Beveridge bill, "believing that it will establish a National standard to correct the evils
                    of child labor in their important National aspects … and will tend to establish equality
                    of economic competition without minimizing State responsibility."<hi rend="sup">67</hi> The
                    gains at the state level had been dishearteningly slow. Even before Beveridge had raised the
                    question, some members of the committee had begun to doubt the advisability of relying upon action
                    by the individual states. The introduction of his bill crystallized this feeling. <list type="footnotes">

                            true—both North and South, of all the States, with very few exceptions. The
                            reason for this impotency is largely attributable to the opposition of manufacturers who
                            fear inter-State competition, and in part is due to the poverty of the States in supplying
                            the necessary machinery, such as factory inspection, to carry out legislation of this kind.
                            The Federal Government, on the contrary, can establish a national uniform standard which
                            equalizes competitive conditions, and the Federal Department of Justice has ample resources

            <p>Beveridge was the featured speaker at the annual convention of the National Child Labor Committee the
                    following week and made a stirring appeal for his bill. The enthusiastic gathering of over four

            <p>Disappointments followed, however. One was the failure of organized labor to rally behind the bill.
                    Beveridge's announcement of his intention to introduce a child labor bill led to a spirited
                    debate on the question at the convention of the American Federation of Labor in mid-November. A
                    resolution was presented that the federation endorse adoption of a national child labor law. But the
                    AFL leadership, headed by Samuel Gompers, in its devotion to self-help through trade-union action,
                    looked askance at the proposal. The AFL ideal remained the impartial policeman state: a national
                    child labor law might possibly set a dangerous precedent for federal interference in labor
                        questions.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> The resolution as amended by the resolutions committee and
                    approved by the convention called for "the enactment of a law in the several states
                    prohibiting the employment of children under sixteen years of age.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although some individual union leaders endorsed the national bill,<hi rend="sup">75</hi> the AFL
                    officially continued to remain aloof. In his report to the 1907 convention, Gompers hedged on the
                    question. Opinion remained divided on the wisdom of action by Congress, he told the delegates. Until
                    further evidence clarified the issues, his only recommendation was that the federation back passage
                    of a model child labor law for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName>. The convention reaffirmed the federation's commitment to state action for
                    dealing with child labor.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> This refusal by the AFL to back his bill weakened
                    Beveridge's hand. When the Hoosier senator wrote the President that "organized
                    labor is overwhelmingly for this bill—militantly for it," Roosevelt retorted
                    that he had spoken with <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Even more disappointing than the aloofness of organized labor was Roosevelt's refusal to
                    lend his support. In his annual message of December, 1906, the President reiterated his plea that
                    Congress authorize an investigation by the Bureau of Labor into the conditions of labor of women and
                    children to "help toward arousing the public conscience." But he affirmed that
                    "each State must ultimately settle the question in its own way…." There
                    was one place, he indicated, where Congress could and should act. That place was the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName> where the constitutional authority of Congress to act was unquestioned. A model child
                    labor law for the District, the chief executive told the lawmakers, would provide a standard for the
                    states to follow.<hi rend="sup">78</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The message came as a sharp disappointment to Beveridge. To save face he told newspapers that the
                    President favored the national bill but was away in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Panama</region>
                    </placeName> and had heard about Beveridge's plans too late to include a recommendation in
                    the message.<hi rend="sup">79</hi> Haunting the White House, he pleaded with the President to send
                    Congress a special message urging the passage of the bill. Roosevelt seriously considered the
                        possibility.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> But he decided against doing so: organized labor was
                    lukewarm; the leaders of the child labor movement were divided; he himself had doubts about the
                    bill's constitutionality; and he well knew the opposition the bill would face in Congress.
                    Unwilling to risk his prestige in a losing fight, the chief executive made up his mind not to back
                    the measure. Passage of the bill authorizing the Bureau of Labor to make an investigation of the
                    laboring conditions of women and children, he wrote a House leader, seems "to me
                    … the only way of practically accomplishing anything on this subject

            <p>Although Congress did, late in January, 1907, authorize the investigation by the Bureau of Labor,
                    Beveridge scorned the action as a largely meaningless sop to outraged public opinion. "The
                    evidence is before the Senate," he complained, "of the slow murder of these
                    children, not by the tens or hundreds, but by the thousands. But let us not
                    'hasten' to their relief 'too fast.' Let us
                        'investigate'…."<hi rend="sup">82</hi> Nor did he regard
                    with enthusiasm the proposal of a model child labor bill for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName>. Child labor in the District was hardly the problem that existed in more heavily
                    industrialized areas. A model bill for the District, he insisted, would prohibit child labor in the
                    place with the least child labor.<hi rend="sup">83</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His strategy was to force the Senate to go on record for or against his bill. In such a showdown, he
                    hoped, few lawmakers would dare vote no. But his bill remained pigeonholed in the Committee on Labor
                    and Education. To bypass the committee, Beveridge took the floor on January 23, 1907, when the
                    Senate had the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName> bill under consideration and offered his bill as an amendment to the pending measure.
                    For three days, January 23, 28, and 29, he read descriptions, supported by affidavits, of the extent
                    and inhumanity of child labor in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">84</hi> With industry grown nation-wide in scope, he declared, the
                    states could not handle the problem. If one state prohibited child labor while others refused to do
                    so, manufacturers in these other states gained an unfair competitive advantage. Unless his bill were
                    adopted, children throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would continue to suffer from the backwardness of the least progressive states.
                    "We all hear talk about the dangers of a certain 'lower class,'"
                    Beveridge admonished his fellow senators. "Had we not better do something to stop the
                    production of that 'lower class,' that 'dangerous class?'

                    "junior supreme court," Beveridge denounced the report as
                    "absurd." The purpose was to head off action on his bill "without giving
                    the courts of the country a chance to pass on the questions at all." The same cry was
                    raised against every reform that threatened the ill-gotten profits of "some unrighteous

                    Pennsylvania, the silk mills of the East, the sweatshops and the railroads that carry their

            <p>To answer the constitutional question Beveridge prepared a lengthy brief defending the
                    constitutionality of his bill. The power to regulate interstate commerce, he argued, involves the
                    power to prohibit any article of commerce from interstate commerce. Such was the generally
                    understood meaning of the word "regulate" at the time the Constitution was
                        adopted.<hi rend="sup">94</hi> There were presently upon the statute books, he pointed out,
                    "no less than seventeen laws prohibiting various articles from interstate
                    commerce." As for the objection that the article prohibited must be injurious in itself,
                    Beveridge noted that Congress in 1905 had forbidden "the transportation in interstate
                    commerce of gold and silver goods with the words 'U. S.
                    Assay'…." No constitutional objections had been raised against that
                    measure; "it was passed," he explained bitterly, "in the interest of a
                    few cheap jewelry manufacturers of <placeName>

            <p>Repeated decisions of the Supreme Court, he insisted, had confirmed the "absolute
                    power" of Congress over interstate commerce. In <hi rend="i">Champion</hi> v. <hi rend="i">Ames</hi> (1903), the famous <hi rend="i">Lottery</hi> case, the Supreme Court by a five to
                    four margin had upheld the authority of Congress to bar lottery tickets from interstate commerce
                    "for the purpose," Beveridge quoted, "of guarding <hi rend="i">the people
                        of the <placeName>

                    tickets from interstate commerce, then why not child-made goods? The decision in <hi rend="i">Champion</hi> v. <hi rend="i">Ames</hi>, Beveridge believed, "absolutely
                    settled" the question of the constitutionality of his bill."<hi rend="sup">97</hi>
                    "There can be no question … that we have the unquestioned power," he

            <p>Although the Fifty-ninth Congress ended without further action on child labor, Beveridge was not
                    discouraged. The struggle in <placeName>

                    he had encountered had increased his alienation from the standpatters in the GOP. In their
                    blindness, Beveridge believed, the reactionaries blundered toward socialism. "I

                    <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-060-1-032"/> When he had first introduced the bill, Beveridge confessed, he
                    thought it would take at least five years to pass. But progress had been so fast, "that I
                    am now hopeful of getting it through the Senate this session of Congress and through both houses at
                    the following session."<hi rend="sup">105</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An unexpected setback, however, was in the offing. The mainstay of Beveridge's support had
                    come from the National Child Labor Committee. But many on the committee remained unreconciled to the
                    national bill. The issue was raised anew when Edgar Gardner Murphy resigned from the committee early
                    in 1906 in protest against its endorsement of the bill. In reversing the committee's former
                    stand against federal legislation, "the Board," Murphy complained, "has
                    departed from a compact which I regarded as inviolable."<hi rend="sup">106</hi> Reflecting
                    deep-seated Southern ideas, Murphy denounced federal intervention in a sphere which he thought
                    properly belonged to the states. The recent gains at the state level, he insisted, had been
                    substantial. The states had not been so negligent as to require federal action. "There is
                    not a social or industrial evil in the whole catalogue of iniquity which the States are meeting with
                    perfect legislation and complete efficiency. Shall we therefore," he asked, "turn
                    over the police functions of the States wholly to the federal power?"</p>
            <p>The bill, Murphy continued, was an unconstitutional invasion of the reserved powers of the states.
                    Even if the bill were constitutional, its effectiveness was doubtful. The bill would not touch the
                    thousands of children making goods for sale within a single state. Without provision for on-the-spot
                    federal inspection, the law would be ineffective and unenforceable. Nor did the bill include the
                    detailed regulations about night work, maximum hours for children over fourteen, and compulsory
                    education required for the fullest protection of the child. Federal legislation bypassing the
                    states, he warned, would lead "to local apathy, which will largely arrest the process of
                    local education" indispensable for further advances. Most importantly, the
                    committee's endorsement of the bill <list type="footnotes">

                    Florence Kelley alerted Beveridge that summer, "a very active subterranean propaganda

                    on and is going to be a 'go,' " he protested to a leading social worker.
                    "It would be absurd for the National Child Labor Committee to abandon it in the middle of
                    the fight." The senator personally appealed to influential members of the committee for
                    their backing.<hi rend="sup">114</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the members voted, eighteen to ten, to withdraw the committee's endorsement. To
                    reconcile Beveridge's backers, the resolution was reworded so as not to mention his bill by
                    name. The revised resolution unanimously adopted by the board provided that "the National
                    Child Labor Committee will for the present take no further action with reference to National
                    legislation" until the investigation underway by the Bureau of Labor was completed and shed
                    more light on the question.<hi rend="sup">115</hi> "I don't like it,"
                    Samuel McCune Lindsay wrote Beveridge, "but., it was the best we could
                        do…".<hi rend="sup">116</hi> Although the resolution was worded to save the
                    senator's face, the import was unmistakable. "You have won out," Robert
                    W. De Forest congratulated Edgar Gardner Murphy.<hi rend="sup">117</hi> "The practical
                    effect of the resolution … is to bind the National Committee during the present session
                    of Congress to take no action in the matter of Federal legislation," Owen R. Lovejoy, the
                    committee's new secretary, wrote Murphy. The committee would confine its energies to
                    working at the state level pending completion of the investigation by the Bureau of Labor.<hi rend="sup">118</hi>

            <p>This setback was followed by another rebuff from the White House. Throughout the fall, Beveridge had
                    bombarded the President with letters urging him to come out in support of the national bill. The

                    against child labor was, Beveridge wrote Roosevelt, "distinctly a part of your national
                    statesmanship. And it is in this national statesmanship that you are doing your greatest service to
                    our country and upon that national statesmanship your name will live in history." The time
                    was ripe. The newspaper and magazine exposures and the work of the National Child Labor Committee
                    had touched the public conscience. "NO legislation you could propose to Congress will be so
                    righteous, or <hi rend="i">anywhere near so popular as this measure.</hi>" To endorse his
                    bill, the senator pleaded, "is wise statesmanship and it is good politics."<hi rend="sup">119</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beveridge's appeals failed to move the President. In his annual message of December, 1907,
                    Roosevelt urged the adoption of an inheritance and income tax, the national incorporation and
                    regulation of interstate businesses, the fixing of railroad rates on the basis of physical
                    valuation, the establishment of a postal savings bank, the limitation of labor injunctions, and the
                    extension of workmen's compensations and of the eight-hour day.<hi rend="sup">120</hi> But
                    he boggled at endorsing the national child labor bill. He questioned the extent of its popular
                    support, remained doubtful about its constitutionality, was skeptical of its effectiveness, and even
                    challenged the facts and figures about child labor that Beveridge had presented. If the states
                    refused to meet their responsibilities, the President warned, Congress would have to act. But before
                    doing this "it ought certainly enact model laws on the subject for the Territories under
                    its own immediate control."<hi rend="sup">121</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Undaunted, Beveridge introduced his bill the first day of the session, His strategy remained as

                    Committee appealed to him not to offer his bill as an amendment. "We are very
                    anxious," Owen R. Lovejoy wrote the senator, "that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName> bill shall be acted upon promptly and … think it is a tactical error to
                    combine the two."<hi rend="sup">123</hi> A similar appeal came from the White House. To
                    offer the national child labor bill as an amendment, Roosevelt warned, would backfire and frighten
                    the Senate into shelving the District bill again. "The wise thing," the chief
                    executive admonished Beveridge, "is to get what is imperatively needed and can be had, and
                    not to throw it away in making what is certain to be an unsuccessful effort to get something else in
                        addition."<hi rend="sup">124</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At first, Beveridge was adamant. The District of Coumbia bill, he replied to the secretary of the
                    National Child Labor Committee, "is for all practical purposes a mere fake."
                    Adoption of the District bill, he maintained, "instead of aiding the cause will delay it
                    for many years." While Congress waited for the states to follow its example, "the
                    murder of innocents will go on."<hi rend="sup">125</hi> Pressure from the White House,
                    however, brought him around. Although agreeing not to offer his bill as an amendment when the
                    District bill came up, the Hoosier lawmaker made no secret of his feelings. He supported the
                    District bill, he told the Senate, "not because it will effect anything of great
                    consequence, but because it is a step, however short, in the right direction…."
                    Although he doubted its efficacy as an example, Beveridge recognized that it was "at least
                    an affirmative moral action upon the part of the National Legislature." The fight for a
                    national law would go on. "Let no person deceive himself," he warned his fellow
                    senators. "This bill, applicable to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName>, where the evil does not really exist, will not assuage the wrath of the American
                    people against what is the real infamy that has awakened the conscience of the nation; nor will it
                    in the remotest degree quiet that conscience.<hi rend="sup">126</hi>

                    </placeName>, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Education, a promise that the

                    "without recommendation" the bill would go on the calendar for Senate action.<hi rend="sup">128</hi> No report, however, was forthcoming. His hopes dashed, the Indiana senator
                    was furious.<hi rend="sup">129</hi> But there was nothing he could do. The time was not yet ripe, he
                    sadly concluded: "We will have to wait a while for more ammunition in the way of
                        facts."<hi rend="sup">130</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the issue was dead for the time being, he had not fought in vain. Beveridge's
                    agitation of the question, the secretary of the National Child Labor Committee found, had prodded
                    Congress into swift approval of both the <placeName>

                    the working conditions of women and children. The publicity given his bill had awakened millions to
                    the plight of the working child. Even at the state level, gains were reported as opponents of the
                    bill hastened to forestall congressional action by improving state laws.<hi rend="sup">131</hi>
                    Taking advantage of the increasing popular interest, the National Child Labor Committee launched a
                    new campaign in the South. Beveridge gave this effort his blessing. But he continued to insist that
                    the problem could be dealt with only by a national law. "It is the sheerest
                    folly," the Hoosier senator reiterated, "to waste the efforts of thousands of

            <p>By 1914, most of the leaders of the child labor movement had come to this conclusion. Twenty-two
                    states still permitted children under fourteen to work in factories; twenty-eight allowed children
                    under sixteen to work more than eight hours a day; and twenty-three had failed to adopt adequate
                    restrictions upon night work. The gap between the more progressive states and the more backward ones
                    was growing wider, not narrower. Despite the opposition of many of its Southern members, the
                    National Child Labor Committee reversed its former reversal and again gave its support to a national
                    child labor law. The American Federation of Labor, the American Medical Association, the National
                    Consumers' League, and the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in <placeName>
                        <region type="state">America</region>
                    </placeName> joined in backing the committee's bill. Scant progress was made, however,
                    until the presidential election year of 1916. Hoping for the votes of the progressive-minded,
                    President Woodrow Wilson pushed the bill through Congress.<hi rend="sup">133</hi> In this moment of
                    triumph, the chief architect of the new law recalled how he had come to Washington ten years before
                    to work for the first national child labor bill. Senator Beveridge, Alexander J. McKelway declared,
                    "deserves to be remembered as the pioneer in the field of federal regulation" of
                    child labor.<hi rend="sup">134</hi>

            <p>Much has been written in recent years about the nature and significance of early twentieth-century
                    progressivism. An interpretation that has gained wide currency holds that progressivism was a
                    middle-class movement looking primarily to the protection and increase of individual economic
                        opportunity.<hi rend="sup">135</hi> This interpretation is not without substance. <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="35" id="VAA4025-060-1-039"/> There was this aspect of progressivism, and many of its most
                    articulate spokesmen did take as their hero "the little man on the make." But
                    there was another side to the movement too—and on that side can be traced the beginnings
                    of the modern welfare state. The advances made at the state level were striking. The years between
                    the turn of the century and America's entry into the first world war witnessed an
                    unprecedented expansion of social welfare legislation in the states: child labor laws, maximum-hour
                    laws for women, the first minimum-wage laws for women, and workmen's compensation laws.<hi rend="sup">136</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gains at the national level were less spectacular. There were, as Theodore Roosevelt explained,
                    "very many excellent men … sincerely opposed, on grounds that at least deserve
                    weighty consideration," to the entrance of the federal government into a sphere
                    traditionally reserved to the states.<hi rend="sup">137</hi> But the logic of events increasingly
                    overrode constitutional scruples. With the growth of industry on a nation-wide basis, the new
                    problems arising in its wake lay beyond the reach of the individual states. The national government,
                    many people believed, was the only agency that could meet the challenge. Therein lay the larger
                    significance of Beveridge's fight for a national child labor law. Its adoption, Arthur S.
                    Link observes, "marked a turning point in American constitutional history—the
                    use of the commerce power to justify almost any form of federal control over working conditions and
                    wages, questions hitherto regarded as being within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                    states." The act passed in 1916 was "the first step toward a potentially
                    comprehensive national social and economic regulation under the commerce power."<hi rend="sup">138</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That regulation became a reality under the New Deal.<hi rend="sup">139</hi> But the foundations had
                    been laid during the progressive era—and Albert J. Beveridge had played a key role in
                    preparing the ground. A line can be drawn from his pioneering <list type="footnotes">

                    constitutional arguments to the New Deal of the Democratic Roosevelt. The prevailing orthodoxy views
                    this development in terms of a liberal versus conservative dichotomy. But the Indiana senator looked
                    at the question from a different angle. His program was, he believed,

                    explained it: "Real conservatism is common sense applied to human conditions; spurious

            <p>This sarcasm emphasized not only the sectional rivalry that attended all internal improving in
                    Indiana but also the need of money. As the abortive efforts at <geogName>Ohio Falls</geogName> had
                    demonstrated, canal construction called for five- and six-figure sums of ready cash that were
                    difficult to collect from farmers and merchants, however eager they were. Money was scarce in the
                    early 1820's, when the whole country wallowed in the slough of a serious depression.
                    Governor William Hendricks, reminding the legislature in 1822 that nation-wide hard times had
                    "put the balance of trade largely against the western country, and produced general and
                    individual distress," cautioned against appropriating borrowed money for improvements:
                    "to these objects, great as they are, the fostering hand of government cannot be extended,
                    while its finances are embarrassed by a state debt."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the time being, then, the Whitewater Canal remained merely a hope. According to local historians,
                    in 1822 or 1823 delegates from six southeastern counties met at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harrison</settlement>

                    </placeName>, to discuss the feasibility of a canal; furthermore that the line was surveyed in
                        1824.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> No convincing evidence indicates that either meeting or survey
                    occurred at any of those times. Nevertheless, events in the making gave the cause impetus. When a
                    business revival in 1823 started the upswing that ended in the next depression fourteen years later,
                    times were more favorable to expensive projects. From the outset, Whitewater improvements advocates
                    were preponderantly in favor of a canal rather than any other form of highway, but that bias is not
                    surprising. They were only reflecting a view that was about to become overwhelmingly persuasive in
                    the Middle West.</p>

                    "The more I reflect on the plan I have proposed, the more thorough is my conviction, not
                    merely of its practicability, but that it must eventually supersede every other mode of conveyance,

            <p>The governor, likewise Robert Livingston and Gouverneur Morris, all with their hearts set on a canal,

                    take over. Thereafter, to stave off collapse, canal men fought a long rearguard action, a procedure

                    minor concern, for the delegates concluded: "there scarcely exists a doubt of the

            <p>Lawmakers were agreeable. Apparently they seldom objected to granting a charter to any organization
                    that professed to be a company. On January 21, 1826, the legislature legalized the Whitewater Canal
                    Company; the charter provided for a capital stock of forty thousand shares at $25 each,
                    authorized a board of seven directors (to be elected annually by stockholders) to transact all
                    business of the company, and permitted the company to receive land or money from the <placeName>

                    </placeName> government or from any other state. It was stipulated, on penalty of nullification of
                    the act, that the company either commence the canal within two years after incorporation or
                    "give to the legislature satisfactory evidence of their intention to prosecute and complete
                    the said canal…." The state reserved the right to purchase one fourth of the

            <p>By the first of July, James Shriver, heading a corps of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    officials. A week later the survey began, but it was only partially completed. On record is a letter
                    from Governor Ray to Shriver suggesting that the engineer begin his surveys in the northern part of
                    the state. At the same time that Whitewater men agitated for a canal, strong voices in the north
                    urged a channel to unite the Maumee and <geogName>Wabash rivers</geogName>, a project that evolved

                    Perhaps Governor Ray was yielding to political pressure when he said to Shriver: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    apparently made no formal report. Governor Ray's message to the eleventh session of the
                    Indiana legislature mentioned only vaguely "a corps of Engineers," who
                    "entered the state during the last spring, with the view of operating here, with the
                    worthy, but <hi rend="i">now</hi> deceased Mr. Shriver at their head…. to enquire into

                    said nothing about the results of that inquiry. Shriver's successor, Major Asa Moore, also
                    died shortly thereafter, and for the time being the unfinished Whitewater survey remained that way.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, though incorporation of the Whitewater Canal Company seemed a herald of immediate
                    action, the usual difficulty of amassing sufficient capital by stock subscriptions upset the scheme.
                    In January, 1827, the legislature amended the charter, the chief change being an extension of the
                    time limit for starting construction to three years from the first Monday in February.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> This gesture was generous but useless. Those eastern capitalists supposed to have been
                    eager to buy stock either had been mythical or had become coy for no money to speak of came the
                    company's way and no shovel dug. Time ran out as southeastern canal affairs floundered and

                    </quote>In his message to the twelfth session of the Indiana legislature in December, 1827, Governor
                    Ray touched upon his favorite theme. "Railways," he said, "are rapidly
                    bearing away the palm of usefulness, from actual experiment, from all other commercial
                    facilities…. Their cost for the same distances, and constructed on the same natural
                    surface, would be … about half that of a canal."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>Legislators unfortunately ignored the governor's hint that, if heeded, might have kept the

                    brusque assurance that "every consideration of usefulness, practicability, durability, and
                    economy, point to canals, and render it obviously inexpedient to waste time upon the subject of
                        railways."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Canal men were in the majority; they had the power
                    and, as they thought, the evidence. The already famous Erie exerted an irresistible magic. In its
                    first full year of operation, Clinton's waterway earned $687,976.68 in tolls,
                    and in the following years the annual income climbed steadily.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> These figures
                    were too dazzling to resist, and they caused mischief in the Middle West. Optimists, seduced by the

                    that there were 1,600 farms in each or 16,000 farms in all. These farms, he figured, would transport
                    enough flour, salt, pork, oats, and other products to pay in tolls annually an average of
                    $19 each or a grand total of $304,000. Subtracting $76,000 for
                    carriage, $50,666 for collection and repairs, and $60,000 for interest at 5

                    commencement of a career of Improvements that will ultimately overwhelm the state with
                    debt." Pointing out that the Whitewater Canal would benefit only eight counties, he said
                    that the other sixty-one would all clamor for money, the result being a state debt of eighteen
                    millions requiring yearly interest of $900,000, "a pretty considerable sum for a
                    young state to pay annually for Nothing!" He maintained that the canal would be hard to
                    keep in repair and that it would not enhance property values as much as people thought. Farmers, he
                    believed, would do better to haul produce by wagon over good roads. Hutchen insisted that <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>In the light of strong canal sentiment in the southeast and elsewhere, it is worth noting that on the
                    Fourth of July, 1834, Indiana citizens had their first ride on a railroad. The legislature having

                    horses—but it was a railroad and a portent. By the summer of 1834 at least thirteen
                    Indiana rail lines had been incorporated and the following year the general assembly chartered four

            <p>When the engineers in the Whitewater Valley completed their survey in December, 1834, they
                    recommended construction of the canal. The 76-mile line was difficult, a fall of 491 feet
                    necessitating 56 locks, 7 dams, and 12 aqueducts over 10 creeks and twice across the West Fork of
                    the Whitewater River. At several points hills forced the line into the river, which would have to be
                    enlarged on the opposite side. The <list type="footnotes">

                    alarming creaks and groans and even showed signs of breaking down. By the end of 1838 the state debt
                    was over $5,000,000; Jesse Williams figured that within another year the total would be
                    $7,000,000 and ultimately $23,000,000.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The famous system

            <p>The company needed those thousands and about twice as much for a very expensive job. In the

                    aqueducts, and a number of bridges, culverts, and water weirs; the estimated cost was over
                    $15,000 per mile. But expense rarely calmed canal mania, which prospered on faith and a
                    firm devotion to installment buying: i. e., with a dribble of cash in hand—say
                    $25,000, which is about what the <placeName>

                    payments. That procedure was routine among canallers in Indiana. This time the company relied on the
                    opinion of Colonel Simpson Torbet, resident engineer, who had predicted that the canal was certain
                    to earn $33,250 a year. <placeName>

                    approximately 1,300 miles of improvements authorized by the mammoth system bill, the state, at a

            <p>Some three years later the company reduced tolls, but whether that gesture increased receipts is
                    difficult to say. Precisely how much traffic the canal carried and what its earnings were are
                    impossible to determine from fragmentary records. Let it be recalled again that in 1834 James
                    Conwell had calculated an annual net canal profit of $117,000. Intermittent reports,
                    however, indicate that gross receipts never came close to that figure and that returns were far from
                    commensurate with the agricultural wealth of a valley productive enough to have yielded those
                    thousands, if not more. Had the canal operated without interruption, and had it enjoyed more
                    confidence among producers, it might well have lived up to Conwell's expectations. In
                    reality, it was a loser for investors although, like all other canals, of considerable benefit to
                    shippers. For March, 1849, the company secretary announced income from tolls and water rents of
                        $7,200.<hi rend="sup">98</hi> Apparently he considered that sum a fairly good one,
                    but, even if receipts continued at that rate for a year, the total would have been scarcely enough
                    to pay debts and to cope with the devastation likely at any time to ride the crests of those
                    destroying rivers. Since the canal rarely enjoyed a full year of uninterrupted navigation, annual
                    gross revenue was probably not ever more than $40,000, a generous guess. Although the
                    rivers were reasonably quiescent during 1849, a cholera epidemic tied up boats and minor freshets
                    caused havoc sufficient to keep parts of the canal out of action a large part of the season and, of
                    course, to dissipate receipts as fast as they came in.<hi rend="sup">99</hi>

                    implies that the Whitewater, when not overrun by too much water, suffered from not enough. Of the
                    two evils, boatmen evidently preferred to scrape through by the aid of brawn and curses rather than
                    to be kept off by floods. No structure of earth or timber was a sure bulwark against high water

                    valley streams. However firmly beams were spiked and bolted, trussed and reinforced, a freshet

            <p>In September, 1852, a culvert collapsed at Ross' Mills, and five thousand yards of earth
                    dropped out of the bank. In December, down came another turbulent rise that dismantled bridges, tore
                    up dams, and, as the Laurel <hi rend="i">News</hi> put it, "suspended navigation till
                    nobody knows when," the high water being "but little lower than the great freshet

                    contracts and although water again reached Laurel six months later, friends of the canal had little
                    fight left and no money. The company, as if shocked into a coma by the unequal struggle, became

                    interests is not clear nor why farmers might not use it to become more modern than they had ever
                    been. A railroad would not affect the status of all those farmers who had kept on transporting by
                    wagon instead of by canal, which they could not depend on anyhow because it was often out of order.
                    At least four serious floods in six years were not sound arguments for spending more money on
                    repairs. The views of the <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi> demonstrated the inviolability of a fixed idea.

                    appointment of a receiver to take possession of all canal property for the benefit of the plaintiff.
                    Judge McLean, possibly the same man as the arbiter in the previous hearing, appointed a receiver but

                    men, perennially hopeful despite realities hard enough to obliterate hope, never more exhilarated
                    than when collecting donations for a ditch that was beyond salvage.</p>
            <p>The effort was abortive. About the same time as the proposal for canal restoration originated, a
                    thousand or more valley residents petitioned the legislature to enact a law permitting a railroad to
                    be built on the line of the Whitewater Canal. The assembly complied. At a called session in
                    November, 1865, it passed an "Act to authorize Railroad Companies to occupy and use for
                    railroad purposes the property of Canal Companies, with their consent," the measure
                    guaranteeing the protection of water power for the benefit of lessees.<hi rend="sup">110</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About three weeks later C. C. Binkley, president of the White Water Valley Canal Company, sold the
                    line once more to Lord, this time for $137,348.12. That was the end of the canal as a
                    means of transportation. Two years later the towpath became the roadbed of a rail line between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Thus the Whitewater Canal ceased to be a highway of commerce, although it continued to
                    serve a number of mills and to develop hydroelectric power for almost a century thereafter. As
                    recently as 1953 the Indiana Flood Control and Water Resources Commission recommended that the canal

                    </placeName> be converted into an enclosed conduit to serve manufacturing plants there.<hi rend="sup">111</hi> As a profit-making work, the ditch thus fulfilled its destiny, although in a
                    manner very different from that envisaged by its early supporters.</p>

            <p>A fundamental problem in a democracy is how to wage war effectively within the bounds set by the
                    Constitution. Every war in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history has been accompanied by protests on the part of the civilian population over
                    alleged constitutional violations and infringements of personal liberties. This was notoriously true
                    of Indiana during the Civil War. Recent scholarly works by Kenneth M. Stampp and Frank L. Klement
                    have questioned the tradition that Indiana was honeycombed with treason and full of Southern
                    sympathizers. Few states contributed as heavily to military victory for the Union cause as did
                    Indiana. But if Klement's definition of Copperheads as "avid critics of the
                    Lincoln administration" is accepted, then it must be admitted that Copperheads were
                    numerous within the Democratic party.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most Indiana Democrats were willing to support a war to preserve the Union but insisted they were
                    fighting to preserve "the Union as it was." They were conservatives alarmed over
                    the revolutionary tendencies set in motion by the war. They frequently accused the Republicans, who
                    were in power, of using the war for the purpose of carrying out a revolution and perpetuating
                    themselves in power. As states' rights disciples of Jefferson and Jackson these Democrats
                    were horrified at the increasing centralization of power in the hands of the federal government, and
                    they were strongly opposed to such economic measures of the wartime Congress as the protective
                    tariff, the national banking law, and the issuance of greenbacks. They were hostile to abolitionists
                    and opposed to the Emancipation Proclamation and to the conversion of the war into a crusade against
                    slavery. Finally they were bitter against both the Lincoln administration and the state
                    administration of Governor Oliver P. Morton for <list type="footnotes">

                    Indiana Supreme Court. In 1858 he was re-elected. While serving on the court he also taught law at
                    North Western Christian University (now <placeName>

            <p>During the fifties he brought sharp criticism upon himself for two decisions. They reflected two
                    characteristics of Perkins' philosophy which were to recur in his later
                    decisions—an insistence upon strict construction of constitutional provisions and
                    opposition to restraints upon personal liberty and the use of private property. The first decision
                    concerned a law enacted in 1855 which absolutely prohibited the manufacture and sale of intoxicating
                    liquors except for medicinal, mechanical, chemical, or sacramental purposes.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    Perkins declared the law unconstitutional on several grounds but principally because it violated
                    personal and property rights. Liquor distilleries were property, he declared, and the legislature
                    could not by a general law "annihilate the entire property in liquors in the
                    state." He cited the constitutional limitations against taking property without just
                    compensation and asked: "What…is the right of property worth, stripped of the

                            Perkins and Smith. At the next session of the legislature Whitcomb again submitted the name
                            of Perkins, and the senate confirmed the nomination on December 30, 1846. At this same
                            session Whitcomb twice submitted the name of Smith and the senate twice refused to confirm
                            the appointment. In December, 1847, Whitcomb once again nominated Smith, and on January 21,
                            1848, his nomination was finally confirmed. Whitcomb was a Democrat as were Perkins and
                            Smith, while the two judges whom they were replacing were Whigs. Indiana, <hi rend="i">Senate Journal</hi> (1845-1846), 488, 533-34; Indiana, <hi rend="i">Senate Journal</hi>

                            Beebe case Perkins spoke for the entire court. In an earlier and little known case he had
                            released a man who had been arrested for breaking the 1855 prohibition law. The man sought
                            release on a writ of habeas corpus. Perkins in granting the release declared the law
                            unconstitutional. He admitted that the legislature could regulate the liquor business but
                            denied that it could prohibit it completely. His reasoning foreshadowed his opinion in the
                            Beebe case. "The right of liberty and pursuing happiness secured by the
                            constitution," he said, "embraces the right, in each <hi rend="i">compos

                    law of 1855 which authorized incorporated cities and towns to levy taxes for the support of public
                    schools within their borders.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> He declared that the law violated the portion of
                    the state constitution which made it the duty of the legislature to provide for a "general
                    and uniform system of common schools wherein tuition shall be without charge and equally open to
                    all." He insisted that in order to meet the requirement of uniformity the school system
                    must operate equally in the city and the country. The provisions enabling municipal corporations to
                    levy a special tax for school purposes made it possible, he said, for the legislature to shirk its
                    duty of maintaining the schools and would lead, he maintained, to a system of schools which were not
                    uniform. On a petition for a rehearing of the case he reiterated the same argument and also declared
                    that the law violated the constitutional provision (Article IV, Section 22) prohibiting the
                    legislature from passing any local or special law for the support of common schools. He held that
                    the law was local because it operated on only a portion of the people and property of the state and
                    permitted one scale of taxation for some school districts and another one for other districts.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>While on the bench Perkins continued to be an active Democrat, frequently writing letters to the
                    press and making political speeches. He was strongly opposed to the antislavery tendencies of the
                    Republican party. In a speech at <placeName>

                    have been avoided by compromise. In a newspaper article in July, 1861, he expressed his fear that
                    "in the prosecution of the war, we may build up a great consolidated military and
                    enormously costly government, which will necessarily deprive us of many of the liberties we have
                    enjoyed in the past." But he said that the South would receive no support from the
                    "ever Union-loving Democracy of the North" and that it was the duty of Democrats
                    "to aid the war so long as the Administration determines to prosecute it constitutionally

                    opposed to the Emancipation Proclamation, which he regarded as a flagrant violation of the
                    Constitution. In January, 1863, Perkins declared the war, as it was being conducted, a failure and
                    appeared to be favorable to an armistice. But a few months later he was calling for the
                    "speedy conquest of the South, so that the war and the strife may
                    cease…" and people "turn their attention to the question of reclaiming
                    their lost liberties, and reestablishing the plain economical republican government which our

                    court which attempted to thwart the governor's plans to take the state's financial
                    affairs into his own hands. The acrimonious 1863 session of the General Assembly, in which the
                    Democrats had a majority, had come to an end without passing an appropriation bill, Towards the end
                    of the session the Republican members had halted the enactment of all legislation by bolting and

                    law and liable to be tried by military authorities. Such persons were denied the privilege of the

                    writ of habeas corpus whenever in his judgment the public safety required it and relieved military
                    officers from the obligation of answering the writ. The act also gave immunity and the protection of

            <p>Democratic members of the 1863 Indiana legislature vehemently protested military arrests and
                    introduced several bills designed to curb them. In the lower house a resolution was passed which
                    condemned military arrests as "acts of tyranny, a flagrant violation of the rights of the
                    people, as unwarranted by the laws of the Constitution," and demanded that "all
                    such arrests shall hereafter cease." A committee created by the house held hearings and
                    examined witnesses in forty-three cases of military arrests. The report of the Democratic majority
                    of the committee found that persons had been "taken into custody upon frivolous
                    pretexts," and that persons had been arrested whose only offense had been the expressions
                    of opinions derogatory to emancipation. "Those who spoke boldly, as freemen ought to
                    do," the majority asserted, "were seized, deprived of liberty, and refused a

                    enlisted men. "This order must be rigidly enforced," he informed Wilcox.
                    "Anyone violating it will be severely punished. I have noticed with surprise, many
                    intoxicated soldiers in our streets. This evil should and must be stopped." Wilcox
                    thereupon issued an order which prohibited all persons engaged in the sale of liquor from making
                    sales to enlisted men and warned that violation would lead to severe punishment. Joseph Griffin, a
                    saloonkeeper, was arrested and imprisoned by Wilcox for disobeying the order. He did not apply for a
                    writ of habeas corpus, but after he was released he brought suit against the captain for false

                    possessed "summary police powers" to deal with all matters affecting the good

                    of Indiana prohibited the bank from refusing to redeem its notes in gold or silver, but, after

                    treasury notes. When the question as to the right of the bank to refuse payment in gold reached the
                    highest state court, it obviously created a dilemna for Judge Perkins, who wrote the majority
                    opinion. It is clear from his language, that, as a loyal Jacksonian and strict constructionist, he
                    viewed the legal tender notes with extreme distaste and thought the act of Congress unconstitutional
                    but feared the results if he rendered an opinion to that effect. He asserted that Congress could
                    exercise only such powers as were granted expressly or incidentally by the Constitution and added
                    "that if the proposition just stated is not true in every particular, then is our
                    government practically one of unlimited powers, and the constitution a delusive bauble."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Nevertheless Congress had issued treasury notes and declared them legal
                    tender and thereby had clearly exceeded its powers in Perkins' view. The judge revealed his
                    dilemma when he admitted that "the disastrous consequences to the country that must follow
                    a denial of the validity" of the legislation, "press hard upon the judiciary to
                    sustain the violation of the constitution, if it be such…." But, on the other
                    hand, to sustain it would "create a precedent for further usurpations." He got
                    himself out of the difficulty by declaring that if the Indiana court were the court of last resort,
                    "the preservation of the constitution, in its letter and spirit, should be an object
                    outweighing…all considerations of temporary inconvenience." The final
                    determination of this question, however, did not lie with the state court but with the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Supreme Court. Therefore, with obvious reluctance, Perkins upheld the act of Congress
                    making the treasury notes legal tender. "Such will be the ruling of this Court,"
                    he declared, "till the Federal Court shall determine the question otherwise."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>In a brief dissenting opinion Judge James M. Hanna met the issue more forthrightly and held
                    unconstitutional the act of Congress making treasury notes legal tender. "Professing to be
                    guided by the plain teaching of the constitution, and knowing in judicial decisions no higher
                    law," he declared, "I can not accord with the conclusion of the Court."
                    He found "that by the constitution the right is not vested in Congress to make a paper
                    named a legal tender in payment of private debts."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two years later, when another case involving legal tender came before the court, Perkins cast aside
                    the restraint he had shown in 1862 and flatly declared that Congress had no power to pass such
                    legislation, but at the same time he again avoided overruling the lower court, which had upheld the
                    validity of the legal tender act.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The case arose out of the question of
                    whether a promissory note, made after Congress had declared the treasury notes legal tender, could
                    be paid in them. The holder of the note refused to accept greenbacks and demanded payment in gold or
                    in treasury notes of a value equivalent to the market value of the gold, because the notes had
                    depreciated. In the <placeName>

                    debtor had agreed to pay a horse, "the measure of the plaintiff's recovery would
                    have been the value of the horse." He asked: "Has this act [of Congress] so far
                    changed the law of contracts as to make a tender on such a contract good when the paper is 47 per
                    cent below par?"<hi rend="sup">33</hi> The county court upheld the plaintiff's
                    demand for the amount of the note but charged him for court costs since a legally valid repayment in

                    contracts less than half of the stipulated value. Furthermore, the act operated "as a fraud
                    on the public creditors and a hardship upon the honest public servants, by depreciating and debasing
                    the currency." Moreover the legislation had the effect of enabling the government to take
                    forced loans "without interest, against the will of the lender," and with
                    repayment of but part of the principal in depreciated currency.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Perkins denied
                    that the power to make paper money legal tender was incidental to any other power of Congress. It
                    was not incidental to the power to borrow money because the power to borrow does not imply the power
                    "to make forced loans, to take the citizens [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] property without his
                    consent, and without just cornpensation."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> It was the intention of the
                    framers of the Constitution, he contended, "to withhold this power of supplanting natural

                    never before been considered. They announced that they were "unanimous in holding an
                    opinion entirely different from that heretofore given by the learned judge

                    opinion that the legal tender act could be upheld under the power of Congress to borrow money and to
                    make all laws "necessary and proper" for carrying out the express powers of

            <p>While Perkins apparently lacked the temerity to declare the legal tender law inoperative, he did
                    invalidate a portion of the wartime internal revenue act on the grounds that it had the effect of
                    encroaching upon the freedom of state courts. The law required the payment of a stamp tax on legal
                    documents and declared invalid those documents to which the stamp was not affixed. In a case

                    the power of Congress to levy direct taxes, duties or imposts, and excises; instead, it was

                    legislation." The federal government might, he thought, take most of the property in a
                    state by taxation if exigencies required it, but it did not have the right, "by direct or

            <p>Perkins and the other Democratic justices were defeated in the 1864 election, which marked the
                    beginning of several years of Republican ascendancy in Indiana. But Perkins enjoyed a kind of
                    vindication—by both the voters of Indiana and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Supreme Court. In 1876 he was elected once more to the Indiana Supreme Court and was
                    serving on that bench when he died in 1879. More significantly, some of the constitutional doctrines
                    he had expounded during the war were affirmed by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Supreme Court in the postwar period. The same arguments which Perkins had used in the
                    Indiana legal tender cases were used by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase in <hi rend="i">Hepburn</hi>
                    v. <hi rend="i">Griswold</hi>, which declared the legal tender legislation of 1862

                    Perkins himself reversed his position on paper money in the postwar years. Like most western

               <hi rend="i">The Populist Response to Industrial America: Midwestern Populist Thought.</hi> By
                    Norman Pollack. (<placeName>

            <p>Populism was not retrogressive. It did not seek to return to an agrarian past. It faced up to the
                    realities of industrial and social change that came in the nineteenth century, and it sought
                    solutions to the problems resulting from that change. In its criticism of American capitalism and in
                    its program, Populism stands revealed as a truly radical force—that is the fundamental
                    thesis which Professor Pollack presents in this important little book. In support of his argument he
                    introduces evidence drawn from a wide variety of sources found largely in state libraries and in
                    other collections in the Middle West. While he focuses on middle western Populist thought, however,
                    he does not hesitate to make generalizations about the movement as a whole.</p>
            <p>Elaborating on his view that "Populism was a progressive social force" (p. 12),
                    Pollack shows middle western Populists concentrating their attention on problems arising from
                    industrialization. They opposed monopoly and the inequality of wealth which they thought resulted
                    from monopoly. Yet they were concerned with the consequences of economic power and not with the
                    personalities or motivations of captains of industry and finance. Their criticism, Pollack contends,
                    did not reflect a conspiracy theory of history but a desire to alter society in a radical direction.
                    Following the lead of Chester M. Destler, he shows how they sought to form a farmer-labor coalition.
                    That such a coalition failed to come about he attributes to labor conservatism rather than to any
                    reluctance on the part of Populists to pursue radical objectives.</p>
            <p>How radical was Populism? Pollack notes that Populists were not Marxists, but he is impressed with
                    parallels between the Populist and Marxist analyses of industrial society: both groups viewed
                    industrial capitalism as a force which alienated man from man; both saw tramps and vagabonds as a
                    symbol and a result of this alienation; both treated ideology as stemming from dominant group
                    interests; both attributed the same economic features to capitalism; both believed that capitalism
                    developed by a dialectical process and both thought in terms of a class struggle. Populist
                    radicalism is also evident in the rivalry between the People's party and the Socialist
                    Labor party. The attacks made by Socialist Labor leaders on the Populists were, according to
                    Pollack, sectarian attacks. Even the policy of fusion, which culminated in the nomination of Bryan
                    by the People's party, is here interpreted as a means of saving radicalism and not as a
                    capitulation to the Democrats.</p>
            <p>This is a stimulating book, one that provides a corrective to the view that Populism was
                    retrogressive and to the view that Populists were opportunistic and anti-Semitic crackpots. It does,
                    however, have its limitations, as Pollack himself recognizes. Because he does not attempt <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-060-1-102"/> to deal with southern Populists, his generalizations must be qualified.
                    More important, running through the book is the suggestion that Populism had an organic existence
                    apart from the individuals who contributed to it. While he admits that some Populists were more
                    "grass-roots" and more "rank-and-file" (whatever this means)
                    than others, the author seems to minimize individual differences in developing the theme of Populist
                    radicalism.</p>
            <p>Individual differences were nevertheless important. Bryan was nominated by the People's
                    party in 1896, as Pollack argues, because enough radical Populists believed that fusion served the
                    radical cause. Yet the consensus was not complete, and in part because of disagreements within the
                    party Tom Watson received the vice-presidential nomination in place of Arthur Sewall,
                    Bryan's running mate on the Democratic ticket. If the primary aim of Populists was to save
                    radicalism by defeating McKinley, it is difficult to see how they might have thought that
                    Watson's nomination could help them achieve their objective.</p>
            <p>Pollack demonstrates that most middle western Populists regarded the silver issue as a means to a
                    larger end. Yet he does not fully appreciate one of the significant realities of 1896: that the
                    silver forces had developed effective organizations which Populists were unable to control. One
                    finds in this work little recognition of the fact that—the silver issue as an economic
                    matter aside—the strength of silver organizations was one of the problems Populists had
                    to face. Certainly one finds no indication of why the silver movement became important independent
                    of Populist support.</p>
            <p>Although Pollack does develop his basic thesis with skill his book raises some significant questions.
                    The author does not pretend otherwise; he describes it as "a tentative first step toward
                    the more comprehensive analysis of industrial America" (p. 1). If this is a hint that he
                    will eventually attempt such an analysis himself, historians can look forward to the appearance of
                    what promises to be a major work.</p>

            <p>John J. Crittenden was a member of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> assembly, governor of that state, representative in Congress, cabinet official under
                    three presidents, and a "president-maker." Five times he was elected to full terms
                    in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate (and to the unexpired term of Henry Clay) and was offered appointments to the
                    Supreme Court by John Quincy Adams and Abraham Lincoln. Yet it was ninety-nine years after his death
                    before a scholarly biography of this rather remarkable man appeared.</p>
            <p>This is a good biography: the research was extensive and intensive, the writing is clear and
                    unambiguous, and the balanced evaluations <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-060-1-103"/> seem well justified by
                    the evidence. It is somewhat ironic—but in keeping with the nature of the subject of the
                    work—that Crittenden on the printed page should still play a role secondary to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and subordinate to the events of the later years of his own life. Kirwan speaks of the
                    irony in the life of Crittenden; perhaps he did not intend so clearly to perpetuate it.</p>
            <p>The volume is divided into three "books" which bear the headings, "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s Lieutenant," "Party Leader," and "The
                    Patriot." In the first, Crittenden is overshadowed by Clay; in the second, covering
                    approximately the ten years following the election of 1844, Crittenden periodically receives star
                    billing; in the third, he is the chief actor who sacrifices any and all personal ambition at the
                    altar of his "only passion," the preservation of the Union.</p>
            <p>Crittenden's ability, his military record, and his connections with the "great
                    families" of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> were factors in his rapid political rise and continued success. He seems to have been
                    nearly always guided by principle and by his devotion to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>. It appears that he may have wanted to become president, but as long as there was a
                    possibility of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s candidacy he suppressed what ambitions he may have had. With <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s failure in 1844, Crittenden became the congressional leader of the Whigs and
                    devoted his energies to grooming Zachary Taylor. When <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> did become a candidate for nomination, Crittenden ceased his activities in
                    Taylor's behalf but the long, intimate relationship of the two Kentuckians cooled.
                    Crittenden's work for Taylor seems to represent a departure from principles—a
                    prostitution to availability—and Kirwan says that it was "almost a bizarre
                    spectacle … to see a man as knowledgeable and as devoted to party as Crittenden choosing
                    and grooming for the Presidency one as ignorant of party principles as Taylor" (p. 478).</p>
            <p>Crittenden was not always a party man. He supported Stephen A. Douglas in the Lecompton controversy,
                    and he viewed the rising Republican party as a threat to the Union. He was a Constitutional Unionist
                    in the late 1850's and denounced both major parties for their actions on and reactions to
                    the slavery issue. He devoted every fiber of himself to his famous compromise proposals of late
                    1860, but the failure of Lincoln to give his approval to these helped send them down to defeat.</p>
            <p>A very able lawyer, a warm friend, a devoted family man, a superior debater and speaker, an almost
                    unparalleled lover of the Union, Crittenden might well have risen to greater heights had he been
                    more politically conscious of the "imperative now."</p>

            <p>Critical opinion concerning Dreiser has often tended toward extremes: he is a careless writer of
                    chaotic sociological novels or a producer of immoral stories (some years ago the Indiana State
                    Library <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-060-1-104"/> refused to purchase any of his works), or he stands at
                    the top of American fiction. It is encouraging, therefore, to encounter a book which avoids these
                    excesses, carefully analyzing his fiction to determine frankly its faults and virtues. Such a study
                    is this readable yet scholarly work by Charles Shapiro. Though fairly short, it claims to be the
                    first book devoted entirely to Dreiser's fiction rather than to his life. Works other than
                    fiction are disregarded.</p>
            <p>Shapiro's purpose, as indicated in the Introduction, is "to understand all of
                    Dreiser's novels in terms of underlying themes which serve as foundations for each book
                    …. to demonstrate that Dreiser was an artist with a purpose, a writer who conceived and
                    executed his work as a result of that purpose. Seeing America as a country emerging from its youth,
                    he was concerned about a culture which … perverted the worthwhile institutions of the
                    society and robbed the individuals of the chance to live up to their full, inherent
                    potentialities" (p. xiii).</p>
            <p>Dreiser is viewed as one of the best American novelists, who powerfully presented his attitude toward
                    our national life through carefully planned, artistic, and beautiful novels. Thus, in <hi rend="i">Sister Carrie</hi> several persons are corrupted by the claims of a false American dream; and
                    in <hi rend="i">Jennie Gerhardt</hi> two families, each decent but of widely different social
                    levels, decay because of social pressures. The trilogy composed of <hi rend="i">The Financier, The
                        Stoic</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Titan</hi> portrays the futile ruthless-ness of American
                    business life; <hi rend="i">The "Genius"</hi> studies the forces harming the
                    creativity of the artist; and <hi rend="i">The Bulwark</hi> shows the failure of religion adequately
                    to solve problems when morality and business collide. <hi rend="i">An American Tragedy</hi> is the
                    epitome of all Dreiser's fiction because in it are found all the themes of his other
                    novels. The short stories are inferior, for they often seem to be compressed novels, demonstrating
                    defects more easily. For example, "Free" is an artistic failure. Throughout
                    Shapiro's book, Dreiser's qualities are seen as concern with sadness, bitterness,
                    human failure, and yet courage amid tragedy—all mixed with a feeling of wonder and
                    sympathy for the characters, though not necessarily approval.</p>
            <p>Although Shapiro's judgments are not always new, they seem to be valid, as in his contention
                    that the <hi rend="i">The "Genius"</hi> is a failure and <hi rend="i">An American
                        Tragedy</hi> the most successful novel. Now and then someone may disagree, as, for instance,
                    with the statement that <hi rend="i">The Financier</hi> is "the best fictional study of the
                    American businessman" (p. 44). But Shapiro gives fair coverage of Dreiser's
                    faults, such as pompous preaching, over-moralizing, awkward, sophomoric passages, boring asides, and
                    failure to capture speech patterns. The author gives evidence of wide reading of other Dreiser
                    critics, from whom the reader may think that he quotes too copiously. Yet, though the book may not
                    add spectacularly to knowledge, it is an important, compact addition to Dreiser criticism.</p>

            <p>Two friends, prosperous, articulate and well-traveled English farmers, were each discontented with
                    his own circumstances and mutually concerned about the plight of English farmers in 1816. Ready to
                    move elsewhere, they selected the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as the only country left for immigration. George Flower, the younger of the two,
                    extensively scouted the newly chosen land, and in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> was joined by Morris Birkbeck's party early in 1817. From <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, this group of ten novice immigrants traveled overland for the next four months to the
                    prairies of southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Seventy miles north of Shawneetown they chose 3,000 acres of "beautiful and
                    rich" prairie land as their final destination. Here on the English <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, during the next decade, the two original proprietors, whose friendship was soon
                    severed, waged a continuous battle against the frontier and the critics who, in increasing numbers,
                    visited their popular and well-publicized settlement. The words of the actual participants and
                    observers edited, as the author certifies, "in the interest of the general
                    reader," tell the story of <hi rend="i">Prairie Albion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A reader, uninitiated into the cult of the frontier, will particularly enjoy this desirable addition
                    to the literature of Americana. Interesting "foreign" observations on the American
                    character, brief discussions of social issues, hasty peeks at frontier towns, and discerning travel
                    episodes crowd their way into the narrative. Both the neophyte and the veteran will find something
                    new in the many vignettes of pioneer life which spark the accounts of settler and observer alike.
                    That these tidbits evade ready detection without canvassing much of the book may be disconcerting to
                    the seasoned arm-chair frontiersman—there is no index or topical reference.</p>
            <p>A frontier "buff" will readily acknowledge the facility with which the author has
                    bridged the diverse accounts with editorial comments. He will be grateful too, that the little-known
                    story of this unique settlement has been added to the annals of the Old Northwest. He will possibly
                    regret that the contemporary reporters did not write more about the settlement itself, for too often
                    the reader loses touch with physical Albion. He will at times lose his sense of chronological
                    location though the total time encompassed is relatively short. He may even generally conclude that
                        <hi rend="i">Prairie Albion</hi> is much old wine in a new bottle.</p>
            <p>A Hoosier will find his interest sporadically piqued by brief descriptions of early
                    nineteenth-century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>

                    </placeName> and the Rapp and Owen settlements at <placeName>

            <p>In this brief book George E. Moore, professor of government at Slippery Rock State College, attempts
                    to present the story of secession and Civil War in the western counties of the Old Dominion and to
                    trace the steps by which the state of West Virignia was created and admitted to the Union. He limits
                    his attention primarily to the years 1860-1863 and almost exclusively to political and military
                    factors. On the whole he has accomplished his purpose quite well.</p>
            <p>Some effort is made in the first thirty pages to summarize the long history of conflict between the
                    western and eastern sections of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> prior to 1860. Unless one dares to assume that the reading public is well informed on
                    the decades of political controversy between these sections, the rather sketchy background provided
                    in this book must be regarded as a serious defect. For example, it has long been thought that the
                    antislavery sentiment of the Methodist Episcopal church was a fact of tremendous importance, and
                    even today one hears it said that the "Methodists made <placeName>
                        <region type="state">West Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>." Professor Moore, however, merely states that "the region was
                    generously supplied with churches, half of which were Methodist and one fifth of which were
                    Baptist" (p. 11) and on the same page adds that "the clergy of the Methodist
                    Episcopal Church denounced slavery and slaveholders." Hardly more attention is given to the
                    nationalistic legacy of the Jacksonian Democrats or to the influence of pro-Union newspapers.</p>
            <p>One reason for the neglect of historical background is probably to be found in the author's
                    view that "there was, to be sure, the tradition of an ancient quest for political
                    independence, but if the 'insurrection' had ended within ninety days …
                    there would have been no new state" (p. xi). The war did not end in ninety days and there
                    was a new state made out of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>—but not out of <placeName>

                    </placeName> or Indiana—and thus the "tradition of an ancient quest for
                    political independence" in western <placeName>

            <p>Agricultural history has never achieved its rightful place in American historiography or in the study
                    of the nation's economic development. There is growing evidence, however, that this
                    situation is gradually being corrected. One of the best current examples of a significant volume in
                    agricultural history is the book under review. Comprehensive in scope, thorough in research, clear
                    in expression, and solid in interpretation, Eric E. Lampard's study of dairying in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> makes a distinct contribution to both agricultural history and the more general
                    economic history of the Midwest. Moreover, it contributes to a better understanding of economic
                    development.</p>
            <p>The author lays the background for a consideration of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s dairy industry by discussing the settlement of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and its early search for agricultural stability and prosperity. Wheat became the main
                    cash crop before 1860 and continued to contest for pre-eminence until it went into permanent decline
                    after 1880. Although the early settlers had a few cows, dairying was initially a household and
                    seasonal business handled largely by farm women. The resulting butter and cheese were of uncertain
                    quality and sales were largely confined to local markets.</p>
            <p>Under the leadership of several enterprising dairymen, however, an increasing number of farmers had
                    turned to commercial dairying by the time of the Civil War. The associated dairy system, where
                    farmers delivered their milk to a central plant, was begun in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> during the 1860's. Within a few years cheese production had moved from the
                    farm to the factory, and by the late 1880's commercial creameries were producing most of
                    the state's market butter. Once committed to dairy specialization, farmers saw the need to
                    increase their efficiency. This was done by adopting scientific principles of feeding and breeding
                    and by emphasizing improvements in farm management. To the dairyman farming became a business
                    wherein he sought to decrease his unit cost and maximize his profit. Surpluses were almost a
                    constant problem for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> dairymen in the late nineteenth century, but under pressure from manufacturers
                    standards were raised to assure higher quality products and to expand potential markets. Farmers
                    often opposed public health measures and quality standards—an indication that they did
                    not recognize their own best long-run interests.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to learn that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> dairy farmers tried to meet their problems through better business methods. Dairymen,
                    for example, did not have much faith in the Populist solutions to agriculture's ills and
                    relied more heavily on education, science, and improved farm practices to solve their difficulties.
                    They did turn to government for protection against the competition of oleomargine, but free silver
                    and government ownership of railroads seemed to have had little appeal for them. Rather than turning
                    to party politics, dairymen used the techniques of modern business lobbies to achieve their
                    objectives.</p>
            <p>After 1900 dairying became the dominant type of farming in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. Moreover, on the basis of commodities, processing of dairy <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-060-1-108"/> products was the state's leading industry by 1920, emphasizing
                    the close relation and interdependence between agriculture and industry. Dairy farming and dairy
                    manufacturing provided a sound base for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s economic growth. The importance of the role of markets in economic
                    development is clearly shown in this study.</p>
            <p>Professor Lampard has set an enviable example to others who are interested in writing similar state
                    or regional studies. The history of agriculture is important for its own sake, but it takes on new
                    and more meaningful dimensions when it is fitted into a broader economic context as has been done so

            <p>This delightful book by an historian famous for his study of the British Empire—Professor
                    Paul Knaplund—is a highly sensitive work wherein the author expresses his deep feelings
                    for Norway, the land of his birth, and for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, the country to which he came at the age of twenty-one and in which he made his
                    academic reputation. The author discusses two moorings important to a fisher-farmer lad turned
                    immigrant, one in the Old World and the other in the New.</p>
            <p>The first part of the book deals with Norway and contains many magnificently written passages
                    descriptive of the author's birthplace north of the Arctic Circle. It is an excellent
                    account of the lives and institutions of his family and neighbors during a period when Norway first
                    marched down the road of independence. Knaplund describes the close affinity of the Norwegian people
                    with the land and sea and shows how he was molded by both the people and the landscape as a
                    reverence for God, sea, mountains, land, and family became vital to him during formative years. As a
                    young man, he was thrilled by the tales and myths of his country and had a deep religious feeling
                    instilled in him by his parents and by the Haugeaner movement. He loved the snugness provided at the
                    old mooring. Yet an insatiable desire to receive an education denied in <placeName>
                        <country>Norway</country>
                    </placeName> caused him to weigh anchor and set sail upon a sea of doubts and problems until he
                    found safe harbor within the walls of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the intervening period, Knaplund personified the story of the Norwegian youth in the Middle West,
                    who, supplied with a limited education and no English, strove to reach the academic heights. He
                    tells of the loneliness of the immigrant and of the problems inherent in adjusting to new horizons
                    and to new landscapes. He discusses Norwegian immigrants whom he knew, such as Hans Christ and the
                    Rev. H. J. Berg, and the effect that immigration had had upon their <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-060-1-109"/> characters. Sometimes Knaplund approaches Ole Rölvaag in his
                    sympathetic understanding of those Norwegians who found neither a safe nor a happy port in the New
                    World.</p>
            <p>Of special interest is the evaluation of the contribution of the small religious colleges and
                    seminaries to both the making of Americans and the preserving of Mother-Country ties. Red Wing
                    Seminary, now defunct but then operated by the Norwegian Synod of the Lutheran church, took the
                    young immigrant to its breast and nurtured him and thus gave him the academic start needed. The
                    basis laid by the grassroots institution was sufficient to enable him to pursue further studies
                    which ultimately led to a doctorate and to a full professorship at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. The tiny seminary and the great university plus sympathy and aid from friends provided
                    the lad from Norway with magic opportunities beyond his fondest dreams. The story of Paul
                    Knaplund's journey from one mooring to another indeed illustrates the great promise that
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> held out to Europeans. It also shows that the fulfillment of the dream was not to be
                    gained by the asking. One had to work long and diligently to realize the full promise of America, or
                    the new mooring might be even more to the windward than was the old one.</p>
            <p>Professor Knaplund writes his story in the third person but does not handle this medium as well as
                    did Henry Adams. In addition the saga contains some repetitions. Notwithstanding these minor faults,
                    the book is valuable. It can be compared favorably with <hi rend="i">Logbook of a Young
                    Immigrant</hi> by another historian, Laurence M. Larson. <hi rend="i">Moorings Old and New</hi> is
                    delightful and reminds one of the charm and sensitivity of another search for a new mooring, one
                    made by that charming Scandinavian woman turned American, Gro Svendson. Like Knaplund, she too met
                    the challenge of the New World with faith, hope, and courage and not with whimpers and cries of
                    despair.</p>

            <p>This book is an account of the origin and growth of closely associated enterprises in the production
                    and sale of timber, lumber, and wood products. The central core of the work is a description of the
                    business activity of Frederick Weyerhaeuser, his associates, and their descendents through four
                    generations. Interwoven with this narrative are discussions of subjects related to lumber and
                    milling activities, including corporate structure, transportation, housing and camps, river rights,
                    land purchases, governmental relationships, mechanization of industry, trade associations, labor,
                    utilization of waste, and conservation.</p>
            <p>At <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Rock Island</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, on a day in 1856, Frederick Weyerhaeuser, a
                    twenty-one-year-old German immigrant employed as a mill hand, sold sixty dollars worth of lumber
                    without authority, but at a good <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-060-1-110"/> profit, while his employer was
                    at lunch. Young Weyerhaeuser was taken into management by his employer and soon owned the business
                    in partnership with another German, Frederick Denkmann. This was the beginning of an association
                    eventually including many other people and continuing through succeeding generations to the present.
                    Surviving the American Civil War, two world wars, and periods of panic and depression, the
                    Weyerhaeuser Company became a nation-wide business having gross sales of $457,916,000 and
                    net profits of $47,751,000 in 1960. Until recent years the associated companies
                    functioned autonomously, being held together by a genuine respect for the business judgment and fair
                    dealing of the Weyerhaeuser associates and their descendents and by some interlocking ownership of
                    stock.</p>
            <p>From the small beginning at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rock Island</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the story of the growth of the Weyerhaeuser interests is one of a search for timber:
                    first, for white pine in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, then for southern pine in Louisana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, and finally for Douglas fir, Ponderosa pine, white pine, and less valuable timber in <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="idu">Idaho</region>
                    </placeName>. With expansion, additional capital was obtained by retaining profits, by recruiting
                    new associates, and recently by the sale of stock to the general public.</p>
            <p>The Weyerhaeuser group kept pace with changes in the industry involving mechanization,
                    transportation, marketing, labor relations, and conservation. From the beginning the associates were
                    concerned about employee welfare with respect to wages, working conditions, and housing and camp
                    facilities. While opposed to unionization, they accepted it and have had reasonable success with it.
                    A common marketing policy emerged slowly. It embraced advertising, sales aids for agents and
                    dealers, and the grading and branding of lumber. Large distribution centers for western lumber
                    products were established along the east coast and in the central states.</p>
            <p>Weyerhaeuser interests in conservation are known outside the industry as a result of an effective and
                    sustained advertising campaign. The associates were in advance of the industry and public
                    conservation agencies in providing fire protection, utilizing lumber waste, instituting sustained
                    yield operations, and employing tree farming. Research was conducted by the associates, and
                    university schools of forestry were supported financially. Currently the Weyerhaeuser Company is
                    growing more board feet of timber annually than it is cutting. The total conservation program of the
                    company was accomplished partly through its independent efforts and partly through cooperation with
                    governmental agencies after a public conservation and timber management policy finally came into
                    being.</p>
            <p>This book is history, impartially written, not corporate propaganda. It is well written and sustains
                    the reader's interest. The documentation is excellent. Ample notes are provided at the
                    close of each chapter, and eighty-three pages of appendixes, mostly statistical, appear at the end.
                    The wide range of personalities, places, and activities dealt with by the authors cannot be covered
                    in this brief review.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">We have made an examination of the book published under the above title, including
                            the Table of Contents, the Preface, the Introduction, and the Select Bibliography. Our
                            examination was made in accordance with generally accepted critical standards and,
                            accordingly, included such tests of the printed documents and such other sampling processes
                            as we considered necessary in the circumstances.</hi>
                    </p>

                        <hi rend="i">In our opinion the documents included in this book are accurately reproduced and
                            they adequately serve to illustrate the title chosen by the author.</hi>

            <p>Any resemblance between the statement above and a certified public accountant's letter of
                    transmittal accompanying an annual audit is purely intentional. It has struck me that the tasks of
                    reviewing a collection of documents and of auditing financial records are not at all dissimilar. The
                    raw materials speak for themselves. After one has vouched for their authenticity there is little
                    more to say.</p>
            <p>One might ask, of course, why another book is added to an already crowded field, but this is after
                    all, the publisher's business, not the reveiwer's. It is true that this book is
                    intended "primarily for the interested general reader and student" in contrast to
                    such works as Merrill Jensen's <hi rend="i">American Colonial Documents to 1776</hi>, which
                    has probably attracted very few general readers. Still, the documents are the same in both books.
                    One can print them in greater or lesser quantity and on better or poorer paper, but one cannot
                    honestly change their character.</p>
            <p>If there is any such being as a general reader interested in working his way through three hundred
                    pages of documents, Braeman's book ought to please him. The excerpts themselves are
                    interesting, consisting as they do of the less arid stretches in the official statutes,
                    proclamations, and resolutions, intermingled with such lively eyewitness testimonies as Jared
                    Ingersoll's report on the Stamp Act debate in Parliament and John Adams'
                    triumphant letter to his wife recounting the passage by the Continental Congress of his May 15,
                    1776, resolution, which he felt to be a true declaration of independence. Furthermore, this skeletal
                    framework is fleshed out with connective tissue in the form of the author's running
                    narrative, which supplies the missing parts and makes the documents themselves more intelligible.</p>
            <p>The most valuable part of Braeman's book, however, is Chapter I, actually entitled
                    "Introduction," in which not a single document appears. Here, Professor Braeman
                    has put together the best essay on the changing historical interpretations of the American
                    Revolution that one can find in the short span of eleven pages. It could well be required reading
                    for courses in historiography. Out of this essay, however, grows my principal criticism of the
                    remainder of Braeman's book. He describes the "neo-Whig" school of
                    interpreters so lucidly that his own membership in that group becomes obvious through his subsequent
                    selection of documents. The neo-Whigs stand squarely upon taxation without <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-060-1-112"/> representation as the cause of the American Revolution, and all of
                    Braeman's documents are chosen to bear upon that theme. He includes no excerpts to
                    illustrate the frontiersmen's grievances against the tidewater aristocracy, nor the
                    Puritans' fear of an Anglican episcopacy. Except for Thomas Whately's essay in
                    defense of parliamentary taxation there is nothing to represent the extensive English and Tory
                    literature on the other side of the issue, nor is there anything to suggest the world context in
                    which the imperial quarrel developed. In other words, the road to independence down which Braeman
                    points is a straight and narrow path.</p>
            <p>A very serious deficiency in the make-up of this book is the fact that the selected documents are not
                    listed in the table of contents. There is no index, of course, but the book does end with a
                    "select bibliography," which is select to the point of discrimination. It contains
                    sixty titles, among which are most of the excellent new studies that have appeared since 1940, but
                    one notes with some concern the absence of works by George L. Beer, Edward Channing, Arthur L.
                    Cross, H. J. Eckenrode, Evarts B. Greene, Marcus W. Jernegan, Charles H. Lincoln, Charles H.
                    McIlwain, and Winfred T. Root.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Prelude to Yorktown</hi> is a delight to read! The dust jacket claim that the men who

                    </placeName>'s southern campaign "come alive" in Mrs. Treacy's
                    account is no exaggeration. The author is at her best in assessing personality, character, and the
                    human relations of a military campaign. She is also at her best—from the very first
                    page—in describing the varied and formidable Carolina terrain and just how it felt to
                    fight, march, and bivouac during a steaming Low Country summer or a cold and rainy Piedmont winter.</p>
            <p>Possessing a background of family and personal connections with professional military men, Mrs.
                    Treacy, a recent University of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Ph.D. in history, brings skill and clarity to the treatment of military history. Her
                    talents converge in the section on the Battle of Cowpens, the high point of the book. Writing from
                    her viewpoint that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> campaign was essentially partisan in character ("I will equip a flying army

                    </placeName> to Washington, quoted on page 196), the author places great emphasis on the factor of
                    leadership. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName>'s failure ever to win a battle (despite winning the over-all campaign) she
                    traces to his lack of the "imponderable quality" of leadership (p. 200). Hence, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName>'s well-laid plans (as at <placeName>

                    </placeName> Courthouse) were nullified by his inability to exact the fullest devotion from the
                    independent-minded and often faltering militia and from the stouter but still imperfect
                    Continentals. The old frontier brawler, Daniel Morgan, was no democrat, but, says Mrs. Treacy, he
                    understood <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-060-1-113"/> his men, had the common touch, and possessed the
                    intangible quality of leadership. Hence, he gained the flawless fighting performance of his soldiers
                    that, along with his flawless battle plan, wrought the miracle of Cowpens. Indeed, it is not <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> but Morgan who emerges as the model and hero of the book. Not only is the Cowpens
                    episode vividly related, but Mrs. Treacy's fresh and persuasive explanation of why Morgan
                    fought <hi rend="i">where</hi> and <hi rend="i">when</hi> he did is perhaps the most important
                    contribution of the book. Rather than give it away here, let the reader himself turn to pages 89-90
                    of <hi rend="i">Prelude to Yorktown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although there are many penetrating insights as Mrs. Treacy follows the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> campaign to Guilford Courthouse, the treatment of the strategic factor is uneven and
                    not up to the literary quality or the feeling for the human element that are notable features of the
                    book. To the understanding of strategic matters the author makes scant contribution except to
                    underline the partisan nature of the campaign and to dwell on the leadership aspect. It is
                    unfortunate also that Mrs. Treacy uses her bibliography to cast aspersions on the work of several
                    able and reputable historians, since, although solid and professional, her own research is not
                    perfect and does reveal some surprising omissions—<hi rend="i">e.g.</hi>, Edward

            <p>Few Americans have had as extensive an experience in government as had John C. Calhoun, congressman,
                    secretary of war, vice-president for two terms, senator, secretary of state, and perennial but ever
                    unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. He served his nation in an
                    official capacity for four decades—from his election to the House of Representatives as a
                    War Hawk in 1810 (after a brief tenure in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> legislature) until his death in 1850 shortly before the Senate passed the great
                    compromise of that year. Richard Crallé edited six volumes of Calhoun's works
                    soon after his death, and as long ago as 1900 the American Historical Association published two
                    volumes of letters to and from him. The current project of the South Caroliniana Society is a
                    full-dress publication of Calhoun papers the bulk of which have long been in print.</p>
            <p>The late Robert L. Meriwether edited the first volume which includes one-hundred-and-fifty-nine
                    documents and some abstracts covering a sixteen-year period. Edwin Hemphill now has edited the
                    second volume for a short eight-month period when Calhoun became secretary of war, from December,
                    1817, to July, 1818. Three thousand of his papers are summarized; two hundred are printed in full,
                    but only a dozen written by Calhoun and personally signed by him are included. <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-060-1-114"/> At this rate, instead of the original estimate of a total of fifteen
                    volumes the project will require twice that number.</p>
            <p>Scholars will always quibble about the proper method of editing the papers of a prominent figure, but
                    many roads lead to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This volume actually tells little about the man, but it is a detailed study of the
                    department he administered. Documents already published are simply summarized, and two out of three
                    of the letters printed here are often inconsequential and routine epistles addressed to him. The
                    text is preceded by an excellent, incisive one-hundred-page introduction describing
                    Calhoun's conduct of his department and the political ramifications thereof. Many
                    historians will agree that an analysis of an important executive department in such a crucial era is
                    worth the effort. William E. Dodd pronounced Calhoun the best secretary of war until Franklin Pierce
                    appointed Jefferson Davis to that post in mid-century. William Lowndes in 1819 wrote from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> that his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> friend was much superior to Lord Palmerston, then serving in the same capacity in the
                    British cabinet. This period in Calhoun's career, when he was an archnationalist, has often
                    been neglected by his biographers.</p>
            <p>Even the informed reader will find most of the contents of this book dull. Calhoun as secretary of
                    war was a vigorous bureaucrat in an important post—he regarded the Treaty of Ghent as
                    only a truce in a critical struggle with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> certain to be resumed at any moment. It is obvious that he was an eager beaver and that
                    he was a man doing a job he thought had to be done; but the Calhoun papers of this period reveal
                    little of that intriguing ambivalence of personality with which he was endowed.</p>
            <p>In general I would question the value to the historical profession of the current re-editing of the
                    works of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Calhoun, particularly in view of the fact that
                    such work has already been adequately done. In my opinion, little that is significant has been added
                    by the tomes now pouring from the presses. The papers of important figures like Thomas Hart Benton,
                    Martin Van Buren, and Stephen A. Douglas, were they made available, would be of far more service.
                    Nor do these new editions shed much additional light on the fundamental question in regard to their
                    subjects, namely "what is he to Hecuba or Hecuba to him?"</p>

            <p>It was just over ten years ago when George P. Hammond's first volume of <hi rend="i">The

                    </placeName>-born Thomas Oliver Larkin arrived at the tiny village of Yerba Buena on <placeName>

                    </placeName> Bay in 1832. The following year he moved to Monterey, the <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-060-1-115"/> capital of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Before he died in 1868, Larkin had become one of the Golden State's richest
                    and most respected citizens. During his residence there he was a hide merchant, land speculator, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> consul at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monterey</settlement>
                    </placeName> (1844-1848). In the latter capacity Larkin played a critical role during the tense days
                    of 1846. He was rather unsympathetic with the gasconade of such noisy patriots as the Bear Flag
                    adventurers. The practical New Englander realized that a transition from the absurdly inoperative
                    Mexican authority to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> occupation, and administration, was but a matter of time. In light of his prominence
                    and wide-ranging activities, one can only regret that typhoid stilled his hand at the age of
                    fifty-six. Today Larkin's papers are a basic key for unlocking <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>'s most dramatic decade. These years witnessed the eclipse of the land-rich and
                    relatively content rancheros by the gold-intoxicated, real estate-hungry, mercantilistic Yankees:
                    men who doubtless could have seized <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> without Robert F. Stockton, Stephen W. Kearney, and John C. Frémont.</p>
            <p>Volume VIII of <hi rend="i">The Larkin Papers</hi> spans the years 1848-1851. In the preceding volume
                    readers observed the initial gold seekers. In the Preface to Volume VIII the editor notes that, by
                    mid-1848, "so fast did the change take place, so sudden was the invasion, and so great its
                    magnitude, that not many realized what had happened or were able to cope with it." Larkin
                    was able to do so, and his fortune rose accordingly. This is the theme of the present volume. The
                    first document is dated October 2, 1848, the last May 15, 1851. Between these dates gold fever
                    spread over the nation, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> boomed, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> was admitted to the Union. Many a researcher will wish that "paisano"
                    Larkin had been a more voluminous recorder of these stirring scenes. Readers are hardly aware of his
                    role in the notable <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> Constitutional Convention of 1849 in which participated such "old
                    Californians" as Mariano G. Vallejo, John A. Sutter, and Abel Stearns. These latter names
                    do occasionally appear in the <hi rend="i">Papers.</hi> Only rarely, however, is there
                    correspondence with such national personalities as Henry Clay, Thomas Hart Benton, Gideon Welles,
                    and James Buchanan.</p>
            <p>Too good a Yankee to waste many words on the social and political scene, Larkin devoted his records
                    primarily to business and family matters. But notable exceptions to this habit make digging in the
                        <hi rend="i">Papers</hi> a rewarding experience. For example, a letter to Secretary of State
                    Buchanan details the quantities of gold which miners had torn from the ground. "Could you
                    know the value of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> Placer", writes Larkin, "as I know it you would think you had been
                    instrumental in obtaining a most splendid purchase for our country, to put no other construction on
                    the Treaty" (p. 38). Others, however, had tasted their full measure of western adventure.
                    As one bemoaned: "I have learned my lesson at too great price in the last ten months. Give
                    me a very small Pile and I will leave these diggings for the Old Bay State…. this country
                    is a perfect <hi rend="i">hell</hi> without money" (p. 329).</p>

            <p>Historical myths sometimes die a slow death. One myth long held by Americans and many of their
                    historians is that prohibition was a singularly conservative measure, promoted primarily by
                    fanatical rural drys. In this little book, a happy combination of good scholarship and good writing,
                    James Timberlake has snuffed out this notion by finding, as it were, the proper home for
                    prohibition. He argues that prohibition was an integral part of progressivism; indeed, it was one of
                    the more important (and least understood) reforms of the Progressive movement. Essentially a
                    middle-class reform, deeply rooted in the American reform tradition, prohibition cut across
                    geographic and class lines. It was successfully stitched into the Constitution, not merely because
                    of the astute tactics of the Anti-Saloon League, but fundamentally because it was buttressed by the
                    moral, economic, social, and political idealism of progressivism itself.</p>
            <p>Thus, argues Timberlake, if progressivism was founded on a belief in the moral law, so was
                    prohibition, which sought to eliminate from commerce an article that was believed to destroy
                    man's reason, paralyze his moral nature, and undermine the very foundation of religion and
                    political democracy. If progressivism was an attempt to limit the power of an industrial and
                    financial plutocracy, prohibition aimed to mash the liquor industry—one of the most
                    corrupting branches of that plutocracy—with its intimate ties to commercialized vice and
                    political machines. If progressivism represented a crusade for humanitarianism, so did prohibition,
                    which held that liquor was a primary cause for poverty, crime, disease, misery, and broken homes.
                    And, finally, if progressivism sought to elevate and improve the status of the lower classes,
                    prohibition attempted to uplift them by banishing intemperance, believed to be of critical
                    importance in stunting the rise of the working-man and the "Americanization" of
                    the immigrant.</p>
            <p>Timberlake is not so unsophisticated as to believe that all progressives were cut out of the same
                    cloth. Prohibition appealed largely to <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-060-1-117"/> the old-stock middle
                    class; although it was supported by some labor groups, the urban-labor-immigrant progressives
                    disliked the reform and fought it. The old-stock middle class won the contest, however, because it
                    constituted the backbone of progressivism and held disproportionate political power. But the key
                    point is not that the prohibition movement was either rural or urban but that it was a middle-class
                    reform supported by middle-class Americans in <hi rend="i">both</hi> country and city. Moreover, it
                    won that support because it was firmly embedded in the aspirations of the Progressive movement.</p>
            <p>Thus came prohibition to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Middle-class Americans—striving to revitalize and preserve American
                    democracy and to usher in a new era of humanity, achievement, and progress—turned to
                    prohibition as one device to achieve their goals. Little did they realize in 1920 the ugly ironies
                    involved in a dry utopia.</p>
            <p>This book, then, is indispensable to students of recent American history. It is at once a brilliant
                    description of the mind and aims of the progressives and one of the best explanations of why this
                    country adopted prohibition.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Early American Homes for Today: A Treasury of Decorative Details and Restoration
                        Procedures.</hi> By Herbert Wheaton Congdon. (Rutland, Vt.: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1963. Pp.
                    xi, 236. Illustrations, glossary, index. $12.50.)</head>
            <p>The growing interest throughout America in restoring old houses and the need for technical advice on
                    how to do it properly have resulted in a number of articles and books on the subject. Herbert
                    Congdon's new book, addressed to what he calls "the do-it-yourself man,"
                    is an informative and attractive addition.</p>
            <p>The volume contains a large number of good illustrations—all the houses pictured are
                    apparently in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>—of exteriors as well as of interior details such as doors, windows,
                    stairways, and mantels.</p>
            <p>For most residents of Indiana the instructions will be of little help because very few of our old
                    houses date as early as those discussed by the author. We have no Colonial architecture in the
                    state, and examples of the Federal style (about 1800 to 1840) are very scarce. Had Congdon placed
                    more emphasis on the Greek Revival types of the 1840's and 1850's, and had he
                    pointed out their characteristic features in contrast to the Federal and the Georgian Colonial ones,
                    the book would serve a wider audience, particularly in the Midwest.</p>
            <p>In reading the book one cannot avoid making comparisons to Henry and Ottalie Williams' work,
                        <hi rend="i">Old American Houses</hi>, that appeared about six years ago and that tackles the
                    same problem. For one thing, the Williamses prove how useful diagrams of constructional elements can
                    be to the remodeler who is not an architect or a carpenter. Mr. Congdon's descriptions of
                    how parts of a building are put together would be clearer to the average reader if more diagrams and
                    detailed drawings accompanied the text.</p>
            <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-060-1-118"/>
            <p>In the opinion of this reader, <hi rend="i">Early American Homes for Today</hi> is weakened by the
                    author's repeated references to the low level of Victorian taste that, in
                    Congdon's opinion, prevailed after the decline of the Classical Revival movement.
                    Excursions into the arena of aesthetic judgments of styles do little to help the man who is faced
                    with the extremely difficult task of restoring an old house. Everyone will agree that Victorian
                    porches and other late nineteenth-century overlays should be removed from houses of the late
                    eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; but, by the same token, "Colonial"
                    doorways and pseudoclassical porticoes should not be allowed to spoil Italianate or French Mansard
                    dwellings as they so often do when fine old Victorian mansions are converted into modern homes and
                    funeral parlors.</p>
            <p>These observations aside, Congdon's book will make a first-rate addition to the library of
                    anyone interested in early American architecture, and it will prove to be a useful guide for the man
                    or woman who wants "to make the most of a neglected but worthy old building" (P.
                    3).</p>

               <hi rend="i">A History: Fifty Years of Cooperative Extension Service in Zndiuna.</hi> By Dave O.
                    Thompson, Sr. ([<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>, <region type="state">Ind.</region>
               </placeName>: Purdue Extension Department, 1962.1 Pp. 159. Illustrations, tables.
                    Paperbound, $.50.) Here is a popular and useful history of the agricultural extension
                    service in Indiana. This work deals principally with the period since Leonard B. Clore became the
                    state's first county agent—in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">LaPorte County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1912 (pp. 23, 25); but it also describes something of Purdue University's
                    early development before that date. The numerous illustrations, supplied for the most part by J. C.
                    Allen &amp; Son of West Lafayette, tell much about the achievements of Hoosier agriculture and
                    the important role of the university in this accomplishment. Such pictures as those of an early
                    telephone (p. 13), an outside pump for use in washing hands and face before meals (p. 15), a
                    farmers' picnic (p. 65), a spring-tooth harrow (p. 87), and a county agent
                    "fording" a stream in a Model T Ford (p. 125) show a lot about rural life in the
                    state during the early decades of this century. Although the need for a comprehensive and scholarly
                    history of Indiana agriculture remains, works like the present one provide worthwhile additions to
                    our knowledge.</p>

                    $3.00; paperbound, $1.45.) Edward Higbee offers an informative and provocative
                    study of American agriculture in recent decades. He notes the enormous impact of science and
                    technology on agriculture and the revolutionary changes in farm life and the conduct of farming; and
                    he reviews the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government's attempts to solve the "farm problem." According
                    to him, the federal government has lavishly subsidized large-scale farmers who <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-060-1-120"/> do not need or deserve aid, largely failed to help marginal and
                    small-scale farmers who are for the most part in miserable circumstances, and refused through both
                    Democratic and Republican administrations to face facts and deal honestly with the problem. This
                    hard-hitting study makes explicit some of the major developments and issues in American agriculture
                    since 1930 but it is much less adequate in indicating possible solutions.</p>

                    </placeName>, this balanced account describes the state's geology and geography, the events
                    of its colonial and territorial eras, and its social and economic as well as its political and
                    constitutional history. Attention is also given to the interplay of <placeName>

                    </placeName> history with that of the nation and the world. Although written primarily for the
                    general reader, this work contains much of substantial value for the scholar. In addition to

                    Civil War battles have passed into limbo. The approximately nine hundred entries indicate that the

                    </placeName> played a role of great significance in the Civil War. Since Indiana soldiers were much

                    important work. Though <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-060-1-121"/> concerned with the fur trade in <placeName>

                    fight neither against nor for the Indians. The difficulties of pioneering, the closeness of the

                    printed in small type contains the public messages and statements of President Kennedy during 1962.
                    Similar volumes have been published for the Eisenhower years and the early years of the Truman
                    administration and others are now being prepared for the remaining years of the Truman period. This
                    series is one of considerable interest to both historians and general readers. The total output of
                    presidential messages and papers has reached staggering proportions. The Preface to this volume
                    intriguingly states that into this book have been "gathered most of the public messages and

                    covering the Truman administration during the year 1947 is, in format and general content, quite
                    similar to the Kennedy volume noted above. The usefulness of such books is too obvious to require
                    further elaboration here. Incidentally, these two collections reflect the different personalities of
                    Presidents Truman and Kennedy and reveal that in spite of common elements each administration has
                    its own moods and problems.</p>
