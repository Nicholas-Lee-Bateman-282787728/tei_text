                    <p>E<hi rend="sc">LNORA COMSTOCK,</hi> have you lost your senses?&quot;
                        demanded the angry voice of Katharine Comstock as she glared at her
                        daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, mother?&quot; faltered the girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you &apos;why mother&apos; me!&quot;
                        cried Mrs. Comstock. &quot;You know very well what I mean.
                        You&apos;ve given me no peace until you&apos;ve had your way about
                        this going to school business; I&apos;ve fixed you good enough, and
                        you&apos;re ready to start. But no child of mine walks the streets of
                        Onabasha looking like a play-actress woman. You wet your hair and comb it
                        down modest and decent and then be off, or you&apos;ll have no time to
                        find where you belong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora gave one despairing glance at the white face, framed in a most
                        becoming riot of reddish-brown hair, which she saw in the little kitchen
                        mirror. Then she untied the narrow black ribbon, wet the comb and plastered
                        the waving curls close to her head, bound them fast, pinned on the skimpy
                        black hat and started for the back door.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-013" n="4"/>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve gone so plum daffy you are forgetting your
                        dinner,&quot; jeered her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want anything to eat,&quot; replied Elnora
                        without stopping.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll take your dinner or you&apos;ll not go one
                        step. Are you crazy? Walk nearly three miles and no food from six in the
                        morning until six at night. A pretty figure you&apos;d cut if you had
                        your way about things! And after I&apos;ve gone and bought you this nice
                        new pail and filled it especial for the first day!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora came back with a face still whiter and picked up the lunch.
                        &quot;Thank you, mother! Good-bye!&quot; she said. Mrs. Comstock did
                        not reply. She watched the girl down the long walk to the gate and out of
                        sight on the road in the bright sunshine of the first Monday of September.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet a dollar she gets enough of it by night!&quot; Mrs.
                        Comstock said positively.</p>
                    <p>Elnora walked by instinct for her eyes were blinded with tears. She left the
                        road where it turned south at the corner of the Limberlost, climbed a snake
                        fence and entered a path worn by her own feet. Dodging under willow and
                        scrub oak branches she at last came to the faint outline of an old trail
                        made in the days when the precious timber of the swamp was guarded by armed
                        men. This path she followed until she reached a thick clump of bushes. From
                        the debris in the end of a hollow log she took a key that unlocked the
                        padlock of a large weatherbeaten old box, inside of which lay several books,
                            <pb id="VAA2373-014" n="5"/> a butterfly apparatus, and an old cracked
                        mirror. The walls were lined thickly with gaudy butterflies, dragonflies,
                        and moths. She set up the mirror and once more pulling the ribbon from her
                        hair, she shook the bright mass over her shoulders, tossing it dry in the
                        sunshine. Then she straightened it, bound it loosely, and replaced her hat.
                        She tugged vainly at the low brown calico collar and gazed despairingly at
                        the generous length of the narrow skirt. She lifted it as she would have
                        liked it to be cut if possible. That disclosed the heavy leather high shoes,
                        at sight of which she looked positively ill, and hastily dropped the skirt.
                        She opened the pail, took out the lunch, wrapped it in the napkin, and
                        placed it in a small pasteboard box. Locking the case again she hid the key
                        and hurried down the trail.</p>
                    <p>She followed it around the north end of the swamp and then struck into a
                        footpath crossing a farm in the direction of the spires of the city to the
                        northeast. Again she climbed a fence and was on the open road. For an
                        instant she leaned against the fence staring before her, then turned and
                        looked back. Behind her lay the land on which she had been born to drudgery
                        and a mother who made no pretence of loving her; before her lay the city
                        through whose schools she hoped to find means of escape and the way to reach
                        the things for which she cared. When she thought of how she looked she
                        leaned more heavily against the fence and groaned; when she thought of
                        turning back and wearing such <pb id="VAA2373-015" n="6"/> clothing in
                        ignorance all the days of her life, she set her teeth firmly and went
                        hastily toward Onabasha.</p>
                    <p>At the bridge crossing a deep culvert at the suburbs she glanced around, and
                        then kneeling she thrust the lunch box between the foundation and the
                        flooring. This left her empty-handed as she approached the great stone high
                        school building. She entered bravely and inquired her way to the office of
                        the superintendent. There she learned that she should have come the week
                        before and arranged for her classes. There were many things incident to the
                        opening of school, and one man unable to cope with all of them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where have you been attending school?&quot; he asked, as he
                        advised the teacher of the cooking department not to telephone for groceries
                        until she saw how many she would have in her classes; wrote an order for
                        chemicals for the students of science; and advised the leader of the
                        orchestra to try to get a professional to take the place of the bass
                        violist, reported suddenly ill.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I finished last spring at Brushwood school, district number
                        nine,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I have been studying all summer. I am
                        quite sure I can do the first year work, if I have a few days to get
                        started.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, of course,&quot; assented the superintendent.
                        &quot;Almost invariably country pupils do good work. You may enter first
                        year, and if you don&apos;t fit, we will find it out speedily. Your
                        teachers will tell you the list of books you must have, and if you will come
                        with me I will show you the way to the auditorium. It is now <pb
                            id="VAA2373-016" n="7"/> time for opening exercises. Take any seat you
                        find vacant.&quot; He was gone.</p>
                    <p>Elnora stood before the entrance and stared into the largest room she ever
                        had seen. The floor sloped down to a yawning stage on which a band of
                        musicians, grouped around a grand piano, were tuning their instruments. She
                        had two fleeting impressions. That it was all a mistake; this was no school,
                        but a grand display of enormous ribbon bows; and the second, that she was
                        sinking, and had forgotten how to walk. Then a burst from the orchestra
                        nerved her while a bevy of daintily clad, sweet-smelling things that might
                        have been birds, or flowers, or possibly gaily dressed, happy young girls,
                        pushed her forward. She found herself plodding across the back of the
                        auditorium, praying for guidance, to an empty seat.</p>
                    <p>As the girls passed her, vacancies seemed to open to meet them. Their friends
                        were moving over, beckoning and whispering invitations. Everyone else was
                        seated, but no one paid any attention to the white-faced girl stumbling
                        half-blindly down the aisle next the farthest wall. So she went on to the
                        very end facing the stage. No one moved, and she could not summon courage to
                        crowd past others to several empty seats she saw. At the end of the aisle
                        she paused in desperation, as she stared back at the whole forest of faces
                        most of which were now turned upon her.</p>
                    <p>In one burning flash came the full realization of her scanty dress, her
                        pitiful little hat and ribbon, her big, <pb id="VAA2373-017" n="8"/> heavy
                        shoes, her ignorance of where to go or what to do; and from a sickening wave
                        which crept over her, she felt she was going to become very ill. Then out of
                        the mass, she saw a pair of big, brown boy eyes, three seats from her, and
                        there was a message in them. Without moving his body he reached forward and
                        with a pencil touched the back of the seat before him. Instantly Elnora took
                        another step which brought her to a row of vacant front seats.</p>
                    <p>She heard the giggle behind her, the knowledge that she wore the only hat in
                        the room, burned her; every matter of moment, and some of none at all, cut
                        and stung. She had no books. Where should she go when this was over? What
                        would she give to be on the trail going home! She was shaking with a nervous
                        chill when the music ceased, and the superintendent arose and, coming down
                        to the front of the flower-decked platform, opened a Bible and began to
                        read. Elnora did not know what he was reading, and she felt that she did not
                        care. Wildly she was racking her brain to decide whether she should sit
                        still when the rest left the room or follow, and ask some one where the
                        Freshmen went first.</p>
                    <p>In the midst of the struggle one clean-cut sentence fell on her ear.
                        &quot;Hide me under the shadow of Thy wings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora began to pray frantically. &quot;Hide me, O God, hide me, under
                        the shadow of Thy wings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again and again she implored that prayer, and <pb id="VAA2373-018" n="9"/>
                        before she realized what was coming, everyone had risen and the room was
                        emptying rapidly. Elnora hurried after the nearest girl and in the press at
                        the door touched her sleeve timidly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you please tell me where the Freshmen go?&quot; she asked
                        huskily.</p>
                    <p>The girl gave her one surprised glance, and drew away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Same place as the fresh women,&quot; she answered, and those
                        nearest her laughed.</p>
                    <p>Elnora stopped praying suddenly and the colour swept into her face.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll wager you are the first person I meet when I find
                        it,&quot; she said and stopped short. &quot;Not that! Oh, I must not
                        do that!&quot; she thought in dismay. &quot;Make an enemy the first
                        thing I do. Oh, not that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She followed with her eyes as the young people separated in the hall, some
                        climbing stairs, some disappearing down side halls, some entering doors
                        nearby. She saw the girl overtake the brown-eyed boy and speak to him, and
                        he glanced back at Elnora and now there was a scowl on his face. Then she
                        stood alone in the hall.</p>
                    <p>Presently a door opened and a young woman came out and entered another room.
                        Elnora waited until she returned, and hurried to her. &quot;Would you
                        tell me where the Freshmen are?&quot; she panted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Straight down the hall, three doors to your left,&quot; was the
                        answer, as the girl passed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One minute please, oh, please,&quot; begged Elnora.
                        &quot;Do I knock or just open the door?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-019" n="10"/>
                    <p>&quot;Go in and take a seat,&quot; replied the teacher.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What if there aren&apos;t any seats?&quot; gasped Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Class rooms are never half-filled, there will be plenty,&quot;
                        was the answer.</p>
                    <p>Elnora removed her hat. There was no place to put it, so she carried it in
                        her hand. She looked infinitely better without it. After several efforts she
                        at last opened the door and stepping inside faced a smaller and more
                        concentrated battery of eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The superintendent sent me. He thinks I belong here,&quot; she
                        said to the professor in charge of the class, but she never before heard the
                        voice with which she spoke. As she stood waiting, the girl of the hall
                        passed on her way to the blackboard, and suppressed laughter told Elnora
                        that her thrust had been repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be seated,&quot; said the professor, and then because he saw
                        Elnora was desperately embarrassed he proceeded to loan her a book and to
                        ask her if she had studied algebra. She said she had a little, but not the
                        same book they were using. He asked her if she felt that she could do the
                        work they were beginning, and she said she did.</p>
                    <p>That was how it happened, that three minutes after entering the room she was
                        compelled to take her place beside the girl who had gone last to the board,
                        and whose flushed face and angry eyes avoided meeting Elnora&apos;s.
                        Being compelled to concentrate on her proposition she forgot herself. When
                        the professor asked that all pupils sign their work she firmly wrote
                        &quot;Elnora <pb id="VAA2373-020" n="11"/> Comstock&quot; under her
                        demonstration. Then she took her seat and waited with white lips and
                        trembling limbs, as one after another the professor called the names on the
                        board, while their owners arose and explained their propositions, or flunked
                        if they had not found a correct solution. She was so eager to catch their
                        forms of expression and prepare herself for her recitation, that she never
                        took her eyes from the work on the board, until clearly and distinctly,
                        &quot;Elnora Cornstock,&quot; called the professor.</p>
                    <p>The dazed girl stared at the board. One tiny curl added to the top of the
                        first curve of them in her name, had transformed it from a good old English
                        patronymic that any girl might bear proudly, to Cornstock. Elnora stared
                        speechless. When and how did it happen? She could feel the wave of smothered
                        laughter in the air around her. A rush of anger turned her face scarlet and
                        her soul sick. A hot answer was on her lips. The voice of the professor
                        addressed her straightly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This proposition seems to be beautifully demonstrated, Miss
                        Cornstalk,&quot; he said. &quot;Surely, you can tell us how you did
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That word of praise saved her. She could do good work. They might wear their
                        pretty clothes, have their friends and make life a greater misery than it
                        ever before had been for her, but not one of them should do better work or
                        be more womanly. That lay with her. She was tall, straight, and handsome as
                        she arose.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-021" n="12"/>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, I can explain my work,&quot; she said in natural
                        tones. &quot;What I can&apos;t explain is how I happened to be so
                        stupid as to make a mistake in writing my own name. I must have been a
                        little nervous. Please, excuse me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She went to the board, swept off the signature with one stroke, then without
                        a tremor she rewrote it clearly. &quot;My name is Comstock,&quot;
                        she said distinctly. She returned to her seat and following the formula used
                        by the others made her first high school recitation.</p>
                    <p>The face of Professor Henley was a study. As Elnora took her seat he looked
                        at her steadily. &quot;It puzzles me,&quot; he said deliberately,
                        &quot;how you can write as beautiful a demonstration, and explain it as
                        clearly as ever has been done in any of my classes, and still be so
                        disturbed as to make a mistake in your own name. Are you very sure you did
                        that yourself, Miss Comstock?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is impossible that anyone else should have done it,&quot;
                        answered Elnora steadily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am very glad you think so,&quot; said the professor.
                        &quot;Being Freshmen, all of you are strangers to me. I should hate to
                        begin the year with you feeling there was one among you small enough to do a
                        trick like that. The next proposition, please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When the hour was gone the class filed back to the study room and Elnora
                        followed in desperation, because she did not know where else to go. She
                        could not study as she had no books, and when the class again left the room
                        to go to another professor for the next recitation, <pb id="VAA2373-022"
                            n="13"/> she went also. At least they could put her out if she did not
                        belong there. Noon came at last, and she kept with the others until they
                        dispersed on the sidewalk. She was so abnormally self conscious she fancied
                        all the hundreds of that laughing throng saw and jested at her. When she
                        passed the brown-eyed boy walking with the girl of her encounter she knew,
                        for she heard him say, &quot;Did you really let that gawky piece of
                        calico get ahead of you?&quot; The answer was indistinct.</p>
                    <p>Elnora hurried from the city. She intended to get her lunch, eat it in the
                        shade of the first tree, and then decide whether she would go back or go
                        home. She knelt on the bridge and reached for her box, but it was so very
                        light that she was prepared for the fact that it was empty before opening
                        it. There was just one thing for which to be thankful. The boy or tramp who
                        had seen her hide it, had left the napkin. She would not have to face her
                        mother and account for its loss. She put it in her pocket, and threw the box
                        into the ditch. Then she sat on the bridge and tried to think, but her brain
                        was confused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps the worst is over,&quot; she said at last. &quot;I
                        will go back. What would mother say to me if I came home now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>So she returned to the high school, followed some other pupils to the coat
                        room, hung her hat, and found her way to the study where she had been in the
                        morning. Twice that afternoon, with aching head and empty stomach, she faced
                        strange professors, in different branches.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-023" n="14"/>
                    <p>Once she escaped notice, the second time the worst happened. She was asked a
                        question she could not answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you not decided on your course, and secured your
                        books?&quot; inquired the professor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have decided on my course,&quot; replied Elnora, &quot;I
                        do not know who to ask for my books.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ask?&quot; the professor was bewildered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understood the books were furnished,&quot; faltered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only to those bringing an order from the township
                        trustee,&quot; replied the Professor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No! Oh, no!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;I will get them
                        to-morrow,&quot; and gripped her desk for support for she knew that was
                        not true. Four books, ranging perhaps at a dollar and a half apiece; would
                        her mother get them? Of course she would notcould not.</p>
                    <p>Did not Elnora know the story by heart. There was enough land, but no one to
                        do clearing and farm. Tax on all those acres, recently the new gravel road
                        tax added, the expense of living and only the work of two women to meet all
                        of it. She was insane to think she could come to the city to school. Her
                        mother had been right. The girl decided that if only she lived to get home,
                        she would stay there and lead any sort of life to avoid more of this
                        torture. Bad as what she wished to escape had been, it was nothing like
                        this. She never could live down the movement that went through the class
                        when she inadvertently revealed the fact that she had expected <pb
                            id="VAA2373-024" n="15"/> her books to be furnished. Her mother would
                        not get them; that settled the question.</p>
                    <p>But the end of misery is never in a hurry to come, for before the day was
                        over the superintendent entered the room and explained that pupils from the
                        country were charged a tuition of twenty dollars a year. That really was the
                        end. Previously Elnora had canvassed a dozen wild plans for securing the
                        money for books, ranging all the way from offering to wash the
                        superintendent&apos;s dishes to breaking into the bank. This additional
                        expense made the thing so wildly impossible, there was nothing to do but
                        hold up her head until she was out of sight.</p>
                    <p>Down the long corridor alone among hundreds, down the long street alone among
                        thousands, out into the country she came at last. Across the fence and
                        field, along the old trail once trodden by a boy&apos;s bitter agony,
                        now stumbled a white-faced girl, sick at heart. She sat on a log and began
                        to sob in spite of her efforts at self-control. At first it was physical
                        breakdown, later, thought came crowding.</p>
                    <p>Oh, the shame, the mortification! Why had she not known of the tuition? How
                        did she happen to think that in the city books were furnished? Perhaps it
                        was because she had read they were in several states. But why did she not
                        know? Why did not her mother go with her? Other mothersbut when had her
                        mother ever been or done anything at all like other mothers? Because she
                        never had been it was useless to blame <pb id="VAA2373-025" n="16"/> her
                        now. Elnora felt she should have gone to town the week before, called on
                        some one and learned all these things herself. She should have remembered
                        how her clothing would look, before she wore it in public places. Now she
                        knew, and her dreams were over. She must go home to feed chickens, calves,
                        and pigs, wear calico and coarse shoes, and pass a library with averted head
                        all her life. She sobbed again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For pity&apos;s sake, honey, what&apos;s the
                        matter?&quot; asked the voice of the nearest neighbour, Wesley Sinton,
                        as he seated himself by Elnora. &quot;There, there,&quot; he
                        continued, smearing tears all over her face in an effort to dry them.
                        &quot;Was it so bad as that, now? Maggie has been just about wild over
                        you all day. She&apos;s got nervouser every minute. She said we were
                        foolish to let you go. She said your clothes were not right, you ought not
                        to carry that tin pail, and that they would laugh at you. By gum, I see they
                        did!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Uncle Wesley,&quot; sobbed the girl, &quot;why
                        didn&apos;t she tell me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you see, Elnora, she didn&apos;t like to. You got such a
                        way of holding up your head, and going through with things. She thought
                        someway that you&apos;d make it, till you got started, and then she
                        begun to see a hundred things we should have done. I reckon you
                        hadn&apos;t reached that building before she remembered that your skirt
                        should have been pleated instead of gathered, your shoes been low, and
                        lighter for hot September Were your things right, Elnora?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-026" n="17"/>
                    <p>The girl broke into hysterical laughter. &quot;Right!&quot; she
                        cried. &quot;Right! Uncle Wesley, you should have seen me among them! I
                        was a picture! They&apos;ll never forget me. No, they won&apos;t get
                        the chance, for they&apos;ll see the same things to-morrow!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, that is what I call spunk, Elnora! Downright grit,&quot;
                        said Wesley Sinton. &quot;Don&apos;t you let them laugh you out.
                        You&apos;ve helped Margaret and me for years at harvest and busy times,
                        what you&apos;ve earned must amount to quite a sum. You can get yourself
                        a good many clothes with it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t mention clothes, Uncle Wesley,&quot; sobbed
                        Elnora. &quot;I don&apos;t care now how I look. If I don&apos;t
                        go back all of them will know it&apos;s because I am so poor I
                        can&apos;t buy my books.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know as you are so dratted poor,&quot;
                        said Sinton meditatively. &quot;There are three hundred acres of good
                        land, with fine timber as ever grew on it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It takes all we can earn to pay the tax, and mother
                        wouldn&apos;t cut a tree for her life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, maybe, I&apos;ll be compelled to cut one for
                        her,&quot; suggested Sinton. &quot;Anyway, stop tearing yourself to
                        pieces and tell me. If it isn&apos;t clothes, what is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s books and tuition. Over twenty dollars in
                        all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph! First time I ever knew you to be stumped by twenty dollars,
                        Elnora,&quot; said Sinton, patting her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s the first time you ever knew me to want
                        money,&quot; <pb id="VAA2373-027" n="18"/> answered Elnora.
                        &quot;This is different from anything that ever happened to me. Oh, how
                        can I get it, Uncle Wesley?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Drive to town with me in the morning and I&apos;ll draw it from
                        the bank for you. I owe you every cent of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know you don&apos;t owe me a penny, and I wouldn&apos;t
                        touch one from you, unless I really could earn it. For anything
                        that&apos;s past I owe you and Aunt Margaret for all the home life and
                        love I&apos;ve ever known. I know how you work, and I&apos;ll not
                        take your money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just a loan, Elnora, just a loan for a little while until you can
                        earn it. You can be proud with all the rest of the world, but
                        there&apos;s no secrets between us, is there, Elnora?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;there are none. You and Aunt
                        Margaret have given me all the love there has been in my life. That is the
                        one reason above all others why you shall not give me charity. Hand me money
                        because you find me crying for it! This isn&apos;t the first time this
                        old trail has known tears and heartache. All of us know that story. Freckles
                        stuck to what he undertook and won out. I stick, too. When Duncan moved away
                        he gave me all Freckles left in the swamp, and as I have inherited his
                        property maybe his luck will come with it. I won&apos;t touch your
                        money, but I&apos;ll win some way. First, I&apos;m going home and
                        try mother. It&apos;s just possible I could find second-hand books, and
                        perhaps all the tuition need not be paid at once. Maybe <pb id="VAA2373-028"
                            n="19"/> they would accept it quarterly. But, oh, Uncle Wesley, you and
                        Aunt Margaret keep on loving me! I&apos;m so lonely, and no one else
                        cares!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley Sinton&apos;s jaws met with a click. He swallowed hard on bitter
                        words and changed the thing he would have said three times before it became
                        articulate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora,&quot; he said at last, &quot;if it hadn&apos;t
                        been for one thing I&apos;d have tried to take legal steps to make you
                        ours when you were three years old. Maggie said then it wasn&apos;t any
                        use, but I&apos;ve always held on. You see, I was the first man there,
                        honey, and there are things you see, that you can&apos;t ever make
                        anybody else understand. She loved him Elnora, she just made an idol of him.
                        There was that oozy green hole, with the thick scum broke, and two or three
                        big bubbles slowly rising that were the breath of his body. There she was in
                        spasms of agony, and beside her the great heavy log she&apos;d tried to
                        throw him. I can&apos;t ever forgive her for turning against you, and
                        spoiling your childhood as she has, but I couldn&apos;t forgive anybody
                        else for abusing her. Maggie has got no mercy on her, but Maggie
                        didn&apos;t see what I did, and I&apos;ve never tried to make it
                        very clear to her. It&apos;s been a little too plain for me ever since.
                        Whenever I look at your mother&apos;s face, I see what she saw, so I
                        hold my tongue and say, in my heart, &apos;Give her a mite more
                        time.&apos; Some day it will come. She does love you, Elnora. Everybody
                        does, honey. It&apos;s just that she&apos;s feeling so much, she
                        can&apos;t express herself. You be a patient girl and wait a little
                        longer. After all, <pb id="VAA2373-029" n="20"/> she&apos;s your mother,
                        and you&apos;re all she&apos;s got, but a memory, and it might do
                        her good to let her know that she was fooled in that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It would kill her!&quot; cried the girl swiftly.
                        &quot;Uncle Wesley, it would kill her! What do you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Wesley Sinton soothingly.
                        &quot;Nothing, honey. That was just one of them fool things a man says,
                        when he is trying his best to be wise. You see, she loved him mightily, and
                        they&apos;d been married only a year, and what she was loving was what
                        she thought he was. She hadn&apos;t really got acquainted with the man
                        yet. If it had been even one more year, she could have borne it, and
                        you&apos;d have got justice. Having been a teacher she was better
                        educated and smarter than the rest of us, and so she was more sensitive
                        like. She can&apos;t understand she was loving a dream. So I say it
                        might do her good if somebody that knew, could tell her, but I swear to
                        gracious, I never could. I&apos;ve heard her out at the edge of that
                        quagmire calling in them wild spells of hers off and on for the last sixteen
                        years, and imploring the swamp to give him back to her, and I&apos;ve
                        got out of bed when I was pretty tired, and come down to see she
                        didn&apos;t go in herself, or harm you. What she feels is too deep for
                        me. I&apos;ve got to respectin&apos; her grief, and I can&apos;t
                        get over it. Go home and tell your ma, honey, and ask her nice and kind to
                        help you. If she won&apos;t, then you got to swallow that little lump of
                        pride in your neck, and come to Aunt Maggie, like you been a-coming all your
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-030" n="21"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll ask mother, but I can&apos;t take your money,
                        Uncle Wesley, indeed I can&apos;t. I&apos;ll wait a year, and earn
                        some, and enter next year.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s one thing you don&apos;t consider,
                        Elnora,&quot; said the man earnestly. &quot;And that&apos;s what
                        you are to Maggie. She&apos;s a little like your ma. She hasn&apos;t
                        given up to it, and she&apos;s struggling on brave, but when we buried
                        our second little girl the light went out of Maggie&apos;s eyes, and
                        it&apos;s not come back. The only time I ever see a hint of it is when
                        she thinks she&apos;s done something that makes you happy, Elnora. Now,
                        you go easy about refusing her anything she wants to do for you.
                        There&apos;s times in this world when it&apos;s our bounden duty to
                        forget ourselves, and think what will help other people. Young woman, you
                        owe me and Maggie all the comfort we can get out of you. There&apos;s
                        the two of our own we can&apos;t ever do anything for. Don&apos;t
                        you get the idea into your head that a fool thing you call pride, is going
                        to cut us out of all the pleasure we have in life beside
                        ourselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Uncle Wesley, you are a dear,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Just
                        a dear! If I can&apos;t possibly get that money any way else on earth,
                        I&apos;ll come and borrow it of you, and then I&apos;ll pay it back
                        if I dig ferns from the swamp and sell them from door to door in the city.
                        I&apos;ll even plant them, so that they will be sure to come up in the
                        spring. I have been sort of panic stricken all day and couldn&apos;t
                        think. I can gather nuts and sell them. Freckles sold moths and butterflies,
                        and I&apos;ve a lot collected.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-031" n="22"/>
                    <p>Of course, I am going back to-morrow! I can find a way to get the books.
                        Don&apos;t you worry about me. I am all right!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, what do you think of that?&quot; inquired Wesley Sinton of
                        the swamp in general. &quot;Here&apos;s our Elnora come back to
                        stay. Head high and right as a trivet! You&apos;ve named three ways in
                        three minutes that you could earn ten dollars, which I figure would be
                        enough to start you. Let&apos;s go to supper and stop
                        worrying!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora unlocked the case, took out the pail, put the napkin in it, pulled the
                        ribbon from her hair, binding it down tight again and followed out to the
                        road. From afar she could see her mother in the doorway. She blinked her
                        eyes, and tried to smile as she answered Wesley Sinton, and indeed she did
                        feel better. She knew now what she had to expect, where to go, and what to
                        do. Get the books she must; when she got them, she would show those city
                        girls and boys how to prepare and recite lessons, how to walk with a brave
                        heart; and they could show her how to wear pretty clothes and have good
                        times.</p>
                    <p>As she neared the door her mother reached for the pail. &quot;I forgot to
                        tell you to bring home your scraps for the chickens,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Elnora entered. &quot;There weren&apos;t any scraps, and I&apos;m
                        hungry again as I ever was in my life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought likely you would be,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock,
                        &quot;and so I got supper ready. We can eat first, and <pb
                            id="VAA2373-032" n="23"/> do the work afterward. What kept you so? I
                        expected you an hour ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora looked into her mother&apos;s face and smiled. It was a queer sort
                        of a little smile, and would have reached the depths with any normal mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see you&apos;ve been bawling,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;I thought you&apos;d get your fill in a hurry. That&apos;s
                        why I wouldn&apos;t go to any expense. If we keep out of the poorhouse
                        we have to cut the corners close. It&apos;s likely this Brushwood road
                        tax will eat up all we&apos;ve saved in years. Where the land tax is to
                        come from I don&apos;t know. It gets bigger every year. If they are
                        going to dredge the swamp ditch again they&apos;ll just have to take the
                        land to pay for it. I can&apos;t, that&apos;s all! We&apos;ll
                        get up early in the morning and gather and hull the beans for winter, and
                        put in the rest of the day hoeing the turnips.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora again smiled that pitiful smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think I didn&apos;t know that I was funny and would be
                        laughed at?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Funny?&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock hotly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, funny! A regular caricature,&quot; answered Elnora.
                        &quot;No one else wore calico, not even one other. No one else wore high
                        heavy shoes, not even one. No one else had such a funny little old hat; my
                        hair was not right, my ribbon invisible compared with the others, I did not
                        know where to go, or what to do, and I had no books. What a spectacle I made
                        for them!&quot; Elnora laughed nervously at her own picture.
                        &quot;But there&apos;s <pb id="VAA2373-033" n="24"/> always two
                        sides! The professor said in the algebra class that he never had a better
                        solution and explanation than mine of the proposition he gave me, which
                        scored one for me in spite of my clothes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I wouldn&apos;t brag on myself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was poor taste,&quot; admitted Elnora. &quot;But, you
                        see, it is a case of whistling to keep up my courage. I honestly could see
                        that I would have looked just as well as the rest of them if I had been
                        dressed as they were. We can&apos;t afford that, so I have to find
                        something else to brace me. It was pretty bad, mother!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m glad you got enough of it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, but I haven&apos;t!&quot; hurried in Elnora.
                        &quot;I just got a start. The hardest is over. To-morrow they
                        won&apos;t be surprised. They will know what to expect. I am sorry to
                        hear about the dredge. Is it really going through?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I got my notification to-day. The tax will be something
                        enormous. I don&apos;t know as I can spare you, even if you are willing
                        to be a laughing-stock for the town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With every bite Elnora&apos;s courage rose, for she was a healthy young
                        thing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve heard about doing evil that good might come from
                        it,&quot; she said. &quot;Well, mother mine, it&apos;s a little
                        like that with me. I&apos;m willing to bear the hard part to pay for
                        what I&apos;ll learn. Already I have selected the ward building in which
                        I shall teach in about four years. I am going to ask for a room with a south
                        exposure <pb id="VAA2373-034" n="25"/> so that the flowers and moths I bring
                        in from the swamp to show the children will do well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You little idiot!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;How are
                        you going to pay your expenses?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, that is just what I was going to ask you!&quot; said
                        Elnora. &quot;You see, I have had two startling pieces of news to-day. I
                        did not know I would need any money. I thought the city furnished the books,
                        and there is an out-of-town tuition, also. I need ten dollars in the
                        morning. Will you please let me have it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ten dollars!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Ten dollars!
                        Why don&apos;t you say a hundred and be done with it! I could get one as
                        easy as the other. I told you! I told you I couldn&apos;t raise a cent.
                        Every year expenses grow bigger and bigger. I told you not to ask for
                        money!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never meant to,&quot; replied Elnora. &quot;I thought
                        clothes were all I needed and I could bear them. I never knew about buying
                        books and tuition.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I did!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I knew what
                        you would run into! But you are so bull-dog stubborn, and so set in your
                        way, I thought I would just let you try the world a little and see how you
                        liked it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora pushed back her chair and looked at her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mean to say,&quot; she demanded, &quot;that you
                        knew, when you let me go into a city classroom and reveal the fact before
                        all of them that I expected to have my books handed out to me; do you mean
                        to say that you knew I had to pay for them?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-035" n="26"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock evaded the direct question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anybody but an idiot mooning over a book or wasting time prowling
                        the woods would have known you had to pay. Everybody has to pay for
                        everything. Life is made up of pay, pay, pay! It&apos;s always and
                        forever pay! If you don&apos;t pay one way you do another! Of course, I
                        knew you had to pay. Of course, I knew you would come home blubbering! But
                        you don&apos;t get a penny! I haven&apos;t one cent, and
                        can&apos;t get one! Have your way if you are determined, but I think you
                        will find the road pretty rocky.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Swampy, you mean, mother,&quot; corrected Elnora. She arose
                        white and trembling. &quot;Perhaps some day God will teach me how to
                        understand you. He knows I do not now. You can&apos;t possibly realize
                        just what you let me go through to-day, or how you let me go, but
                        I&apos;ll tell you this. You understand enough that if you had the
                        money, and would offer it to me, I wouldn&apos;t touch it now. And
                        I&apos;ll tell you this much more. I&apos;ll get it myself.
                        I&apos;ll raise it, and do it some honest way. I am going back
                        to-morrow, the next day, and the next. You need not come out, I&apos;ll
                        do the night work, and hoe the turnips.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was ten o&apos;clock when the chickens, pigs, and cattle were fed, the
                        turnips hoed, and a heap of bean vines was stacked by the back door.</p>

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">ESLEY</hi> S<hi rend="sc">INTON</hi> walked down the road a
                        half-mile and turned in at the lane leading to his home. His heart was hot
                        and filled with indignation. He had told Elnora he did not blame her mother,
                        but he did. His wife met him at the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see anything of Elnora, Wesley?&quot; she questioned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Most too much, Maggie,&quot; he answered. &quot;What do you
                        say to going to town? There&apos;s a few things has to be got right
                        away?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did you see her, Wesley?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Along the old Limberlost trail, my girl, torn to pieces sobbing.
                        Her courage always has been fine, but the thing she met to-day was too much
                        for her. We ought to have known better than to let her go that way. It
                        wasn&apos;t only clothes; there were books, and entrance fees for
                        out-of-town people, that she didn&apos;t know about; while there must
                        have been jeers, whispers, and laughing. Maggie, I feel as if I&apos;d
                        been a traitor to those girls of ours. I ought to have gone in and seen
                        about this school business. I&apos;m no man to let a fatherless <pb
                            id="VAA2373-037" n="28"/> girl run into such trouble. Don&apos;t
                        cry, Maggie. Get me some supper, and I&apos;ll hitch up and see what we
                        can do now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What can we do, Wesley?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t just know. But we&apos;ve got to do something.
                        Kate Comstock will be a handful, while Elnora will be two, but between us we
                        must see that the girl is not too hard pressed about money, and that she is
                        dressed so she is not ridiculous. She&apos;s saved us the wages of a
                        woman many a day, can&apos;t you make her some decent dresses,
                        Maggie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m not just what you call expert, but I could beat
                        Kate Comstock all to pieces. I know that skirts should be pleated to the
                        band instead of gathered, and full enough to sit in, and short enough to
                        walk in. I could try. There&apos;s patterns for sale. Let&apos;s go
                        right away, Wesley.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, set me a bite of supper, while I hitch up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret Sinton started for the cupboard when she remembered that Wesley had
                        worked all day and was hungry as usual, so she built a fire, made coffee,
                        and fried ham and eggs. She set out pie and cake and had enough for a hungry
                        man by the time the carriage was at the door, but she had no appetite. She
                        dressed while Wesley ate, put away the food while he dressed, and then they
                        drove toward the city through the beautiful September evening, and as they
                        went they planned for Elnora. The only trouble was, not whether they were
                        generous enough to get what she needed, but whether <pb id="VAA2373-038"
                            n="29"/> she would accept what they got, <unclear/> would say.</p>
                    <p>They went to a large dry goods <unclear/> clerk asked what they wanted to see
                        <unclear/> knew, so they stepped to one side and held <unclear/>
                        consultation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What had we better get, Wesley?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dresses,&quot; said Wesley promptly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But how many dresses, and what kind?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Blest if I know!&quot; exclaimed Wesley. &quot;I thought
                        you would manage that. I know about some things I&apos;m going to
                        get.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At that instant several school girls came into the store and approached them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There!&quot; exclaimed Wesley breathlessly. &quot;There,
                        Maggie! Like them! That&apos;s what she needs! Buy like they
                        have!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret stared. What did they wear? They were rapidly passing, they seemed
                        to have so much, and she could not decide so quickly. Before she knew it she
                        was among them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon, but won&apos;t you wait one
                        minute?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>The girls stopped with wondering faces.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s your clothes,&quot; explained Mrs. Sinton.
                        &quot;You look just beautiful to me. You look exactly as I should have
                        wanted to see my girls. They both died of diphtheria when they were little,
                        but they had yellow hair, dark eyes and pink cheeks, and everybody thought
                        they <pb id="VAA2373-039" n="30"/>
                        <unclear/> lived, they&apos;d been near your <unclear/> them to look
                        like you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <unclear/> but sympathy in every girl face <unclear/> Sinton.</p>
                    <p>
                        <unclear/> you!&quot; said one of them. &quot;We are <unclear/> for
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <unclear/> course, you are,&quot; said Margaret. &quot;Everybody
                        <unclear/> has been. And because I can&apos;t ever have the joy of a
                        mother in thinking for my girls and buying pretty things for them, there is
                        nothing left for me, but to do what I can for some one who has no mother to
                        care for her. I know a girl, who would be just as pretty as any of you, if
                        she had the clothes, but her mother does not think about her, so I got to
                        mother her some myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She must be a lucky girl,&quot; said another.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, she loves me,&quot; said Margaret, &quot;and I love
                        her. I want her to look just like you do. Please tell me about your clothes.
                        Are these the dresses and hats you wear to school? What kind of goods are
                        they, and where do you buy them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The girls began to laugh and cluster around Margaret. Wesley Sinton strode
                        down the store with his head high in pride of her, but his heart was sore
                        over the memory of two little faces under Brushwood sod. He inquired his way
                        to the shoe department.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, every one of us have on gingham or linen dresses,&quot;
                        they said, &quot;and they are our school clothes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For a few moments there was a babel of laughing <pb id="VAA2373-040" n="31"/>
                        voices explaining to the delighted Margaret that school dresses should be
                        bright and pretty, but simple and plain, and until cold weather they should
                        wash.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell you,&quot; said Ellen Brownlee, &quot;my
                        father owns this store, I know all the clerks. I&apos;ll take you to
                        Miss Hartley. You tell her just how much you want to spend, and what you
                        want to buy, and she will know how to get the most for your money.
                        I&apos;ve heard papa say she was the best clerk in the store for people
                        who didn&apos;t know precisely what they wanted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the very thing,&quot; agreed Margaret.
                        &quot;But before you go, tell me about your hair. Elnora&apos;s hair
                        is bright and wavy, but yours is silky as hackled flax. How do you do
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora?&quot; asked four girls in concert.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, Elnora is the name of the girl I want these things
                        for.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did she come to the high school to-day?&quot; questioned one of
                        them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was she in your classes?&quot; demanded Margaret without reply.</p>
                    <p>Four girls stood silent and thought fast. Had there been a strange girl among
                        them, and had she been overlooked and passed by with indifference, because
                        she was so very shabby? If she had appeared as much better than they, as she
                        had looked worse, would her reception have been the same?</p>
                    <p>&quot;There was a strange girl from the country in the <pb
                            id="VAA2373-041" n="32"/> Freshman class to-day,&quot; said Ellen
                        Brownlee, &quot;and her name was Elnora.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was the girl,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are her people so very poor?&quot; questioned Ellen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, not poor at all, come to think of it,&quot; answered
                        Margaret. &quot;It&apos;s a peculiar case. Mrs. Comstock had a great
                        trouble and she let it change her whole life and make a different woman of
                        her. She used to be lovely, now she is forever saving and scared to death
                        for fear they will go to the poor-house; but there is a big farm, covered
                        with lots of good timber. The taxes are high for women who can&apos;t
                        manage to clear and work the land. There ought to be enough to keep two of
                        them in good shape all their lives, if they only knew how to do it. But no
                        one ever told Kate Comstock anything, and never will, for she won&apos;t
                        listen. All she does is droop all day, and walk the edge of the swamp half
                        the night, and neglect Elnora. If you girls would make life just a little
                        easier for her, it would be the finest thing you ever did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>All of them promised they would.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now tell me about your hair,&quot; persisted Margaret Sinton.</p>
                    <p>So they took her to a toilet counter, and she bought the proper hair soap,
                        also a nail file, and cold cream, for use after windy days. Then they left
                        her with the experienced clerk, and when at last Wesley found her she was
                        loaded with bundles and the glint of other days was in her beautiful eyes.
                        Wesley carried some packages also.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-042" n="33"/>
                    <p>&quot;Did you get any stockings?&quot; he whispered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I didn&apos;t,&quot; she said. &quot;I was so
                        interested in dresses and hair ribbons and aa hat&quot; she hesitated
                        and glanced at Wesley. &quot;Of course, a hat!&quot; prompted
                        Wesley. &quot;That I forgot all about those horrible shoes.
                        She&apos;s got to have decent shoes, Wesley.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure!&quot; said Wesley. &quot;She&apos;s got decent
                        shoes. But the man said some brown stockings ought to go with them. Take a
                        peep, will you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley opened a box and displayed a pair of thick soled, beautifully shaped
                        brown walking shoes of low cut. Margaret cried out with pleasure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, do you suppose they are the right size, Wesley? What did you
                        get?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I just said for a girl of sixteen with a slender foot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s about as near as I could come. If they
                        don&apos;t fit when she tries them, we will drive straight in and change
                        them. Come on, now, let&apos;s get home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>All the way they discussed how they should give Elnora their purchases and
                        what Mrs. Comstock would say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am afraid she will be awful mad,&quot; said Margaret Sinton
                        tremulously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;ll just rip!&quot; replied Wesley graphically.
                        &quot;But if she wants to leave the raising of her girl to the
                        neighbours, she needn&apos;t get fractious if they take some pride in
                        doing a good job. From now on I calculate Elnora shall go to school; and she
                        shall have all the clothes and books she needs, if I go around on the back
                        of Kate Comstock&apos;s land and cut a tree, or drive off a calf to pay
                        for <pb id="VAA2373-043" n="34"/> them. Why I know one tree she owns that
                        would put Elnora in heaven for a year. Just think of it, Margaret!
                        It&apos;s not fair. One-third of what is there belongs to Elnora by law,
                        and if Kate Comstock raises a row I&apos;ll tell her so, and see that
                        the girl gets it. You go to see Kate in the morning, and I&apos;ll go
                        with you. Tell her you want Elnora&apos;s pattern, that you are going to
                        make her a dress, for helping us. And sort of hint at a few more things. If
                        Kate balks, I&apos;ll take a hand and settle her I&apos;ll go to law
                        for Elnora&apos;s share of that land and sell enough to educate
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Wesley Sinton, you&apos;re perfectly wild.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not! Did you ever stop to think that such cases are so
                        frequent there have been laws made to provide for them? I can bring it up in
                        court and force Kate to educate Elnora, and board and clothe her till
                        she&apos;s of age, and then she can take her share.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wesley, Kate would go crazy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s crazy now. The idea of any mother living with as
                        sweet a girl as Elnora, and letting her suffer till I find her crying like a
                        funeral. It makes me fighting mad. All uncalled for. Not a grain of sense in
                        it. I&apos;ve offered and offered to oversee clearing her land and
                        working her fields. Let her sell a good tree, or a few acres. Something is
                        going to be done, right now. Elnora&apos;s been fairly happy up to this,
                        but to spoil the school life she&apos;s planned, is to ruin all her
                        life. I won&apos;t have it! If Elnora won&apos;t take these things,
                        so help me, I&apos;ll tell her what she is worth, and loan her the money
                            <pb id="VAA2373-044" n="35"/> and she can pay me back when she comes of
                        age. I am going to have it out with Kate Comstock in the morning. Here we
                        are! You open up what you got while I put away the horses, and then
                        I&apos;ll show you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Wesley came from the barn Margaret had four pieces of crisp gingham, a
                        pale blue, a pink, a gray with green stripes and a rich brown and blue
                        plaid. On each of them lay a yard and a half of wide ribbon to match. There
                        were handkerchiefs and a brown leather belt. In her hands she held a
                        wide-brimmed tan straw hat, having a high crown banded with velvet strips
                        each of which fastened with a tiny gold buckle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It looks kind of bare now,&quot; she explained. &quot;It
                        had three quills on it here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you have them taken off?&quot; asked Wesley dubiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I did. The price was two and a half for the hat, and those
                        things were a dollar and a half apiece. I couldn&apos;t pay
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It does seem considerable,&quot; admitted Wesley, &quot;but
                        will it look right without them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, it won&apos;t!&quot; said Margaret.
                        &quot;It&apos;s going to have quills on it. Do you remember those
                        beautiful peacock wing feathers that Phoebe Simms gave me? Three of them go
                        on just where those came off, and nobody will ever know the difference. They
                        match the hat to a moral, and they are just a little longer and richer than
                        the ones that I had taken off. I was wondering whether</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-045" n="36"/>
                    <p>I better sew them on to-night while I remember how they set, or wait till
                        morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t risk it!&quot; exclaimed Wesley anxiously.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t you risk it! Sew them on right now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Open your bundles, while I get the thread,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
                    <p>Wesley set out the shoes. Margaret took them up and pinched the leather and
                        stroked them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My, but they are pretty!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>Wesley picked up one and slowly turned it in his big hands. He glanced at his
                        foot and back to the shoe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a little bit of a thing, Margaret,&quot; he said
                        softly. &quot;Like as not I&apos;ll have to take it back. It
                        don&apos;t look as if it could fit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It don&apos;t look like it dared do anything else,&quot;
                        said Margaret. &quot;That&apos;s a happy little shoe to get the
                        chance to carry as fine a girl as Elnora to high school. Now,
                        what&apos;s in the other box?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley looked at Margaret doubtfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why,&quot; he said, &quot;you know there&apos;s going
                        to be rainy days, and those things she has now ain&apos;t fit for
                        anything but to drive up the cows&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wesley, did you get high shoes, too?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, she ought to have them! The man said he would make them
                        cheaper if I took both pairs at once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret laughed aloud. &quot;Those will do her past Christmas,&quot;
                        she exulted. &quot;What else did you get?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Wesley, &quot;I saw something to-day.
                        You told me about Kate getting that tin pail for Elnora <pb id="VAA2373-046"
                            n="37"/> to carry to high school and you said you told her it was a
                        shame. I guess Elnora was ashamed all right, for to-night she stopped at the
                        old case Duncan gave her, and took out that pail, where it had been all day,
                        and put a napkin inside it. Coming home she confessed she was half starved
                        because she hid her dinner under a culvert, and a tramp took it. She
                        hadn&apos;t had a bite to eat the whole day. But she never complained at
                        all, she was tickled to death that she hadn&apos;t lost the napkin. So I
                        just inquired around till I found this, and I think it&apos;s about the
                        ticket. Decent looking and handy as you please. See here, now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley opened the package and laid a brown leather lunch box on the table.
                        &quot;Might be a couple of books, or drawing tools or most anything
                        that&apos;s neat and genteel. You see, it opens this way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It did open, and inside was a space for sandwiches, a little porcelain box
                        for cold meat or fried chicken, another for salad, a glass with a lid which
                        screwed on, held by a ring in a corner, for custard or jelly, a flask for
                        tea or milk, a beautiful little knife, fork, and spoon fastened in holders,
                        and a place for a napkin.</p>
                    <p>Margaret was almost crying over it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How I&apos;d love to fill it!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do it the first time, just to show Kate Comstock what love
                        is!&quot; said Wesley. &quot;Get up early in the morning and make
                        one of those dresses to-morrow. Can&apos;t you make a plain gingham
                        dress in a day? I&apos;ll pick a chicken, and you fry it and fix a
                        little custard <pb id="VAA2373-047" n="38"/> for the cup, and do it up
                        brown. Go on, Maggie, you do it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never can,&quot; said Margaret. &quot;I am slow as the
                        itch about sewing, and these are not going to be plain dresses when it comes
                        to making them. There are going to be edgings of plain green, pink, and
                        brown to the bias strips, and tucks and pleats about the hips, fancy belts
                        and collars, and all of it takes time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then Kate Comstock&apos;s got to help,&quot; said Wesley.
                        &quot;Can the two of you make one, and get that lunch
                        to-morrow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Easy, but she&apos;ll never do it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see if she don&apos;t!&quot; said Wesley. &quot;You
                        get up and cut it out, and soon as Elnora is gone I&apos;ll go after
                        Kate myself. She&apos;ll take what I&apos;ll say better alone. But
                        she&apos;ll come, and she&apos;ll help make the dress. These other
                        things are our Christmas gifts to Elnora. She&apos;ll no doubt need them
                        more now than she will then, and we can give them just as well.
                        That&apos;s yours, and this is mine, or whichever way you
                        choose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley untied a good brown umbrella and shook out the folds of a long, brown
                        raincoat. Margaret dropped the hat, arose and took the coat. She tried it
                        on, felt it, cooed over it and matched it with the umbrella.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did it look anything like rain to-night?&quot; she inquired so
                        anxiously that Wesley laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And this last bundle?&quot; she said, dropping back in her
                        chair, the coat still over her shoulders.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-048" n="39"/>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t buy this much stuff for any other woman and
                        nothing for my own,&quot; said Wesley. &quot;It&apos;s Christmas
                        for you, too, Margaret!&quot; He shook out fold after fold of soft gray
                        satiny goods that would look lovely against Margaret&apos;s pink cheeks
                        and whitening hair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you old darling!&quot; she exclaimed, and fled sobbing into
                        his arms.</p>
                    <p>But she soon dried her eyes, raked together the coals in the cooking stove
                        and boiled one of the dress patterns in salt water for a half-hour. Wesley
                        held the lamp while she hung the goods on the line to dry. Then she set the
                        irons on the stove so they would get hot the first thing in the morning.</p>

                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> four o&apos;clock next morning Elnora was shelling
                        beans. At six she fed the chickens and pigs, swept two of the rooms of the
                        cabin, built a fire, and put on the kettle for breakfast. Then she climbed
                        the narrow stairs to the attic she had occupied since a very small child,
                        and dressed in the hated shoes and brown calico, plastered down her crisp
                        curls, ate what breakfast she could, and pinning on her hat started for
                        town.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no sense in your going for an hour yet,&quot; said her
                        mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must try to discover some way to earn those books,&quot;
                        replied Elnora. &quot;I am perfectly positive I shall not find them
                        lying along the road wrapped in tissue paper, and tagged with my
                        name.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She went toward the city as on yesterday. Her perplexity as to where tuition
                        and books were to come from was worse but she did not feel quite so badly.
                        She never again would have to face all of it for the first time. She had
                        been through it once, and was yet living. There had been times yesterday
                        when she had prayed to be hidden, or to drop dead, and neither had happened.
                        &quot;I guess the <pb id="VAA2373-050" n="41"/> best way to get an
                        answer to prayer is to work for it,&quot; muttered Elnora grimly.</p>
                    <p>Again she took the trail to the swamp, rearranged her hair and left the tin
                        pail. This time she folded a couple of sandwiches in the napkin, and tied
                        them in a neat light paper parcel which she carried in her hand. Then she
                        hurried along the road to Onabasha and found a bookstore. There she asked
                        the prices of the list of books that she needed, and learned that six
                        dollars would not quite supply them. She anxiously inquired for second-hand
                        books, but was told that the only way to secure them was from the last
                        year&apos;s Freshmen. Just then Elnora felt that she positively could
                        not approach any of those she supposed to be Sophomores and ask to buy their
                        old books. The only balm the girl could see for the humiliation of yesterday
                        was to appear that day with a set of new books.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you wish these?&quot; asked the clerk hurriedly, for the
                        store was rapidly filling with school children wanting anything from a
                        dictionary to a pen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; gasped Elnora, &quot;Oh, yes! But I cannot pay
                        for them just now. Please let me take them, and I will pay for them on
                        Friday, or return them as perfect as they are. Please trust me for them a
                        few days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The clerk looked at her doubtfully and took her name.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll ask the proprietor,&quot; he said. When he came
                        back Elnora knew the answer before he spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; he said, &quot;but Mr. Hann
                        doesn&apos;t recognize your name. You are not a customer of ours, and he
                        feels <pb id="VAA2373-051" n="42"/> that he can&apos;t take the risk.
                        You &apos;ll have to bring the money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora clumped out of the store, the thump of her heavy shoes beating as a
                        hammer on her brain. She tried two other houses with the same result, and
                        then in sick despair came into the street. What could she do? She was too
                        frightened to think. Should she stay from school that day and canvass the
                        homes appearing to belong to the wealthy, and try to sell beds of wild
                        ferns, as she had suggested to Wesley Sinton? What would she dare ask for
                        bringing in and planting a clump of ferns? How could she carry them? Would
                        people buy them? She slowly moved past the hotel and then glanced around to
                        see if there was a clock anywhere, for she felt sure the young people
                        passing her constantly were on their way to school.</p>
                    <p>There it stood in a bank window in big black letters staring straight at her:

                    <p>Elnora caught the wicket at the cashier&apos;s desk with both hands to
                        brace herself against disappointment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is it wants to buy cocoons, butterflies, and moths?&quot;
                        she panted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Bird Woman,&quot; answered the cashier. &quot;Have you
                        some for sale?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-052" n="43"/>
                    <p>&quot;I have some, I do not know if they are what she would
                        want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you had better see her,&quot; said the cashier.
                        &quot;Do you know where she lives?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Would you tell me the
                        time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Twenty-one after eight,&quot; was the answer.</p>
                    <p>She had nine minutes to reach the auditorium or be late. Should she go to
                        school, or to the Bird Woman? Several girls passed her walking swiftly and
                        she remembered their faces. They were hurrying to school. Elnora caught the
                        infection. She would see the Bird Woman at noon. Algebra came first, and
                        that professor was kind. Perhaps she could slip to the superintendent and
                        ask him for a book for the next lesson, and at noon&quot;Oh, dear Lord
                        make it come true,&quot; prayed Elnora, at noon maybe she could sell
                        some of those wonderful shining-winged things she had been collecting all
                        her life around the outskirts of the Limberlost.</p>
                    <p>As she went down the long hall she noticed the professor of mathematics
                        standing in the door of his recitation room. When she came up to him he
                        smiled and spoke to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have been watching for you,&quot; he said, and Elnora stopped
                        bewildered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For me?&quot; she questioned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Professor Henley. &quot;Step
                        inside.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora followed him into the room and he swung the door behind them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At teachers&apos; meeting last evening, one of the professors
                        mentioned that a pupil had betrayed in class that she had <pb
                            id="VAA2373-053" n="44"/> expected her books to be furnished by the
                        city. I thought possibly it was you. Was it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; breathed Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That being the case,&quot; said Professor Henley, &quot;it
                        just occurred to me as you had expected that, you might require a little
                        time to secure them, and you are too fine a mathematician to fall behind for
                        want of supplies. So I telephoned one of our Sophomores to bring her last
                        year&apos;s books this morning. I am sorry to say they are somewhat
                        abused, but the text is all here. You can have them for two dollars, and pay
                        when you get ready. Would you care to take them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora sat suddenly, because she could not stand another instant. She reached
                        both hands for the books, and said never a word. The professor was silent
                        also.</p>
                    <p>At last Elnora arose, hugging those books to her heart as a mother grasps a
                        lost baby.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One thing more,&quot; said the professor. &quot;You can pay
                        your tuition quarterly. You need not bother about the first instalment this
                        month. Any time in October will do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It seemed as if Elnora&apos;s gasp of relief must have reached the soles
                        of her brogans.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did any one ever tell you how beautiful you are!&quot; she
                        cried.</p>
                    <p>As the professor was lank, tow-haired and so nearsighted, that he peered at
                        his pupils through spectacles, no one ever had.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Professor Henley, &quot;I&apos;ve waited
                        some time <pb id="VAA2373-054" n="45"/> for that; for which reason I shall
                        appreciate it all the more. Come, now, or we shall be late for opening
                        exercises.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So Elnora entered the auditorium a second time. Her face was like the
                        brightest dawn that ever broke over the Limberlost. No matter about the
                        lumbering shoes and skimpy dress just now. No matter about anything, she had
                        the books. She could take them home. In her garret she could commit them to
                        memory, if need be. She could show that clothes were not all. If the Bird
                        Woman did not want any of the many different kinds of specimens she had
                        collected, she was quite sure now she could sell ferns, nuts, and a great
                        many things. Then, too, someone moved over this morning, and several girls
                        smiled and bowed. Elnora forgot everything save her books, and that she was
                        where she could use them intelligentlyeverything except one little thing
                        away back in her head. Her mother had known about the books and the tuition,
                        and had not told her when she agreed to her coming.</p>
                    <p>At noon Elnora took her little parcel of lunch and started to the home of the
                        Bird Woman. She must know about the specimens first and then she would go
                        out to the suburbs somewhere and eat a few bites. She dropped the heavy iron
                        knocker on the door of the big red log cabin, and her heart thumped at the
                        resounding stroke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is the Bird Woman at home?&quot; she asked of the maid.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is at lunch,&quot; was the answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please ask her if she will see a girl from the Limberlost about
                        some moths?&quot; inquired Elnora.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-055" n="46"/>
                    <p>&quot;I never need ask, if it&apos;s moths,&quot; laughed the
                        girl. &quot;Orders are to bring anyone with specimens right in. Come
                        this way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora followed down the hall and entered a long room with high panelled
                        wainscoting, old English fireplace with an overmantel and closets of
                        peculiar china filling the corners. At a bare table of oak, yellow as gold,
                        sat a woman Elnora often had watched and followed covertly around the
                        Limberlost. The Bird Woman was holding out a hand of welcome.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I heard!&quot; she laughed. &quot;A little pasteboard box,
                        or just the bare word &apos;specimen,&apos; passes you at my door.
                        If it is moths I hope you have hundreds. I&apos;ve been very busy all
                        summer and unable to collect, and I need so many. Sit down and lunch with
                        me, while we talk it over. From the Limberlost, did you say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I live near the swamp,&quot; replied Elnora. &quot;Since
                        it&apos;s so cleared I dare go around the edge in daytime, though we are
                        still afraid at night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have you collected?&quot; asked the Bird Woman, as she
                        helped Elnora to sandwiches unlike any she ever before had tasted, salad
                        that seemed to be made of many familiar things, but you were only sure of
                        celery and apples, and a cup of hot chocolate that would have delighted any
                        hungry schoolgirl.</p>
                    <p>Elnora said &quot;Thank you,&quot; and set the things before her, but
                        her eyes were on the Bird Woman&apos;s face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am afraid I am bothering you for nothing, and imposing on
                        you,&quot; she said. &quot;That &apos;collected&apos;
                        frightens <pb id="VAA2373-056" n="47"/> me. I&apos;ve only gathered. I
                        always loved everything outdoors, and so I made friends and playmates of
                        them. When I learned that the moths die so soon, I saved them especially,
                        because there seemed no wickedness in it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have thought the same thing,&quot; said the Bird Woman
                        encouragingly. Then because the girl could not eat until she learned about
                        the moths, the Bird Woman asked Elnora if she knew what kinds she had.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not all of them,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;Before Mr.
                        Duncan moved away he often saw me near the edge of the swamp, and he showed
                        me the box he had fixed for Freckles, and gave me the key. There were some
                        books and things, so from that time on I studied and tried to take moths
                        right, but I am afraid they are not what you want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are they the big ones that fly mostly June nights?&quot; asked
                        the Bird Woman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Great gray ones with reddish
                        markings, pale blue-green, yellow with lavender, and red and
                        yellow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean by &apos;red and yellow?&apos;&quot;
                        asked the Bird Woman so quickly that the girl almost jumped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not exactly red,&quot; explained Elnora, with tremulous voice.
                        &quot;A reddish, yellowish brown, with canary-coloured spots and gray
                        lines on their wings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How many of them?&quot; It was the same quick question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I had over two hundred eggs,&quot; said Elnora,
                        &quot;but some of them didn&apos;t hatch, and some of the <pb
                            id="VAA2373-057" n="48"/> caterpillars died, but there must be at least
                        a hundred perfect ones.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perfect! How, perfect?&quot; cried the Bird Woman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean whole wings, no down gone, and all their legs and
                        antennae,&quot; faltered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Young woman, that&apos;s the rarest moth in America,&quot;
                        said the Bird Woman solemnly. &quot;If you have a hundred of them, they
                        are worth a hundred dollars according to my list. I can use all that are
                        whole.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What if they are not pinned right,&quot; quavered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If they are perfect, that does not make the slightest difference. I
                        know how to soften them so that I can put them into any shape I choose.
                        Where are they? When may I see them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are in Freckles&apos;s old case in the
                        Limberlost,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I couldn&apos;t carry many
                        for fear of breaking them, but I could bring a few after school.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You come here at four,&quot; said the Bird Woman, &quot;and
                        we will drive out with some specimen boxes, and a price list, and see what
                        you have to sell. Are they your very own? Are you free to part with
                        them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are mine,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;No one but God
                        knows I have them. Mr. Duncan gave me the books and the box. He told
                        Freckles about me, and Freckles told him to give me all he left. He said for
                        me to stick to the swamp and be brave, and my hour would come, and it has! I
                        know most of them are all right, and oh, I do need the money!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Could you tell me?&quot; asked the Bird Woman softly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-058" n="49"/>
                    <p>&quot;You see the swamp and all the fields around it are so
                        full,&quot; explained Elnora. &quot;Every day I felt smaller and
                        smaller, and I wanted to know more and more, and pretty soon I got
                        desperate, just as Freckles did. But I am better off than he was, for I have
                        his books, and I have a mother; even if she don&apos;t care for me as
                        other girls&apos; mothers do for them, it&apos;s better than no
                        one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Bird Woman&apos;s glance fell, for the girl was not conscious of how
                        much she was revealing. Her eyes were fixed on a black pitcher filled with
                        goldenrod in the centre of the table and she was saying what she thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As long as I could go to the Brushwood school I was happy, but I
                        couldn&apos;t go further just when things got the most interesting, so I
                        was bound I&apos;d come to high school and mother wouldn&apos;t
                        consent. You see there&apos;s plenty of land, but father was drowned
                        when I was a baby, and mother and I can&apos;t make money as men do. The
                        taxes get bigger every year, and she said it was too expensive. I
                        wouldn&apos;t give her any rest, until at last she got me this dress,
                        and these shoes and I came. It was awful!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora stopped short and stared into the Bird Woman&apos;s face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you live in that beautiful cabin at the northwest end of the
                        swamp?&quot; asked the Bird Woman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember the place and a story about it now. You entered the high
                        school yesterday?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was pretty bad?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-059" n="50"/>
                    <p>&quot;Pretty bad!&quot; echoed Elnora.</p>
                    <p>The Bird Woman laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t tell me anything about that,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I once entered a city school straight from the country. My dress
                        was brown calico, and my shoes were quite heavy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The tears began to roll down Elnora&apos;s cheeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did they?&quot; she faltered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They did!&quot; said the Bird Woman. &quot;All of it. I am
                        quite sure they did not miss one least little thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she wiped away some tears that began rolling down her cheeks, and
                        laughed at the same time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are they now?&quot; asked Elnora suddenly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, they are pretty widely scattered, but none of them have
                        attained heights out of range. Some of the rich are poor, and some of the
                        poor are rich. Some of the brightest died insane, and some of the dullest
                        worked out high positions, some of the very worst to bear have gone out, and
                        I frequently hear from others. Now I am here, able to remember it, and
                        mingle laughter with what used to be all tears; for every day I have my
                        beautiful work, and almost every day God sends some one like you to help me.
                        What is your name, my girl?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora Comstock,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;Yesterday on
                        the board it changed to Cornstock, and for a minute I thought I&apos;d
                        die, but I can laugh over that already.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Bird Woman arose and kissed her. &quot;Finish your lunch,&quot;
                        she said, &quot;and I will get my price lists, and take down a
                        memorandum of what you think you have, <pb id="VAA2373-060" n="51"/> so I
                        will know how many boxes to prepare. And remember this. What you are lies
                        with you. If you are lazy, and accept your lot, you may live in it. If you
                        are willing to work, you can write your name anywhere you choose, among the
                        only ones who live past the grave in this world, the people who write books
                        that help, make exquisite music, carve statues, paint pictures, and work for
                        others. Never mind the calico dress, and the coarse shoes. Dig into the
                        books, and before long you will hear yesterday&apos;s tormentors
                        boasting that they were once classmates of yours. &apos;I could a tale
                        unfold&apos;!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughingly left the room and Elnora sat thinking, until she remembered
                        how hungry she was, so she ate the food, drank the hot chocolate and began
                        the process of getting a grip on herself.</p>
                    <p>Then the Bird Woman came back and showed Elnora a long printed slip giving a
                        list of graduated prices for moths, butterflies and dragon flies.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, do you want them!&quot; exulted Elnora. &quot;I have a
                        few and I can get more by the thousand, with every color in the world on
                        their wings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; said the Bird Woman, &quot;I will buy them, also
                        the big moth caterpillars that are creeping everywhere now, and the cocoons
                        that they will spin just about this time. I have a sneaking impression that
                        the mystery, wonder, and the urge of their pure beauty, are going to force
                        me to picture and paint our moths and put them into a book for all the world
                        to see and know. We Limberlost people must not be selfish with the wonders
                        God has given to us.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-061" n="52"/>
                    <p>We must share with those poor cooped-up city people the best we can. To send
                        them a beautiful book, that is the way, is it not, little new friend of
                        mine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, oh yes!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;And please God they
                        find a way to earn the money to buy the books, as I have those I need so
                        badly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will pay good prices for all the moths you can find,&quot;
                        said the Bird Woman, &quot;because you see I exchange them with foreign
                        collectors. I want a complete series of the moths of America to trade with a
                        German scientist, another with a man in India, and another in Brazil. Others
                        I can exchange with home collectors for those of California and Canada, so
                        you see I can use all you can raise, or find. The banker will buy stone
                        axes, arrow points, and Indian pipes. There was a teacher from the city
                        grade schools here to-day for specimens. There is a fund to supply the ward
                        buildings. I&apos;ll help you get in touch with that. They want leaves
                        of different trees, flowers, grasses, moths, insects, birds&apos; nests
                        and anything about birds.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora&apos;s eyes were blazing. &quot;Had I best go back to school
                        or open a bank account and begin being a millionaire? Uncle Wesley and I
                        have a bushel of arrow points gathered, a stack of axes, pipes,
                        skin-dressing tools, tubes and mortars. I don&apos;t know how I ever
                        will wait three hours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must go, or you will be late,&quot; said the Bird Woman.
                        &quot;I will be ready at four.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After school closed Elnora, seated by the Bird Woman, <pb id="VAA2373-062"
                            n="53"/> drove to Freckles&apos;s old room in the Limberlost. One at
                        a time the beautiful big moths were taken from the interior of the old black
                        case. Not a fourth of them could be moved that night and it was almost dark
                        when the last box was closed, the list figured, and into Elnora&apos;s
                        trembling fingers were paid fifty-nine dollars and sixteen cents. Elnora
                        clasped the money closely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh you beautiful stuff!&quot; she cried. &quot;You are
                        going to buy the books, pay the tuition, and take me to high
                        school.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then because she was a woman, she sat on a log and looked at her shoes. Long
                        after the Bird Woman drove away Elnora remained. She had her problem, and it
                        was a big one. If she told her mother, would she take the money to pay the
                        taxes? If she did not tell her, how could she account for the books, and
                        things for which she would spend it. At last she counted out what she needed
                        for the next day, placed the rest in the farthest corner of the case, and
                        locked the door. She then filled the front of her skirt from a heap of arrow
                        points beneath the case and started home.</p>

                        Sinton was busy with the gingham and the intricate paper pattern she had
                        purchased. Wesley cooked the breakfast and worked until he thought Elnora
                        would be gone, then he started to bring her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now you be mighty careful,&quot; cautioned Margaret.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t know how she will take it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t either,&quot; said Wesley philosophically,
                        &quot;but she&apos;s got to take it some way. That dress has to be
                        finished by school time in the morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley had not slept well that night. He had been so busy framing diplomatic
                        speeches to make to Mrs. Comstock that sleep had little chance with him.
                        Every step nearer to her he approached his position seemed less enviable. By
                        the time he reached the front gate and started down the walk between the
                        rows of asters and lady slippers he was perspiring, and every plausible and
                        convincing speech had fled his brain. Mrs. Comstock helped him. She met him
                        at the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; she said. &quot;Did Margaret send you
                        for something?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-064" n="55"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Wesley. &quot;She sent me for you.
                        She&apos;s got a job that&apos;s too big for her, and she wants you
                        to help.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I will,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. It was no
                        one&apos;s affair how lonely the previous day had been, or how the
                        endless hours of the present would drag. &quot;What is she doing in such
                        a rush?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now was his chance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s making a dress for Elnora,&quot; answered
                        Wesley. He saw Mrs. Comstock&apos;s form straighten, and her face
                        harden, so he continued hastily. &quot;You see Elnora has been helping
                        us at harvest time, butchering, and with unexpected visitors for years.
                        We&apos;ve made out that she&apos;s saved us a considerable sum, and
                        as she wouldn&apos;t ever touch any pay for anything, we just went to
                        town and got a few clothes we thought would fix her up a little for the high
                        school. We want to get a dress done to-day mighty bad, but Margaret is slow
                        about sewing, and she never can finish alone, so I came for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And it&apos;s such a simple little matter, so dead easy; and
                        all so between old friends like, that you can&apos;t look above your
                        boots while you explain it,&quot; sneered Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;Wesley Sinton, what put the idea into your head that Elnora would
                        take things bought with money, when she wouldn&apos;t take the
                        money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then Sinton&apos;s eyes came up straightly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Finding her on the trail last night sobbing as hard as I ever saw
                        any one at a funeral. She wasn&apos;t complaining at all, but
                        she&apos;s come to me all her life with her little hurts, <pb
                            id="VAA2373-065" n="56"/> and she couldn&apos;t hide how
                        she&apos;d been laughed at, twitted, and run face to face against the
                        fact that there was books and tuition, unexpected, and nothing will ever
                        make me believe you didn&apos;t know that, Kate Comstock.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If any doubts are troubling you on that subject, sure I knew it!
                        She was so anxious to try the world, I thought I&apos;d just let her
                        take a few knocks and see how she liked it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As if she&apos;d ever taken anything but knocks all her
                        life!&quot; cried Wesley Sinton. &quot;Kate Comstock, you are a
                        heartless, selfish woman. You&apos;ve never showed Elnora any real love
                        in her life. If ever she finds out that thing you&apos;ll lose her, and
                        it will serve you right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She knows it now,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock icily, &quot;and
                        she&apos;ll be home to-night just as usual.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you are a brave woman if you dared put a girl of
                        Elnora&apos;s make through what she suffered yesterday, and will suffer
                        again to-day, and let her know you did it on purpose. I admire your nerve.
                        But I&apos;ve watched this since Elnora was born, and I got enough.
                        Things have come to a pass where they go better for her, or I
                        interfere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As if you&apos;d ever done anything but interfere all her life!
                        Think I haven&apos;t watched you? Think I, with my heart raw in my
                        breast, and too numb to resent it openly, haven&apos;t seen you and Mag
                        Sinton trying to turn Elnora against me day after day? When did you ever
                        tell her what her father meant to me? When did you ever try to make her see
                        the wreck of my life, and what I&apos;ve <pb id="VAA2373-066" n="57"/>
                        suffered? No indeed! Always it&apos;s been poor little abused Elnora,
                        and cakes, kissing, extra clothes, and encouraging her to run to you with a
                        pitiful mouth every time I tried to make a woman of her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kate Comstock, that&apos;s unjust,&quot; cried Sinton.
                        &quot;Only last night I tried to show her the picture I saw the day she
                        was born. I begged her to come to you and tell you pleasant what she needed,
                        and ask you for what I happen to know you can well afford to give
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock. &quot;You know
                        I can&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then get so you can!&quot; said Wesley Sinton. &quot;Any
                        day you say the word you can sell six thousand worth of rare timber off this
                        place easy. I&apos;ll see to clearing and working the fields cheap as
                        dirt, for Elnora&apos;s sake. I&apos;ll buy you more cattle to
                        fatten. All you&apos;ve got to do is sign a lease, to pull thousands
                        from the ground in oil, as the rest of us are doing all around
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cut down Robert&apos;s trees!&quot; shrieked Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;Tear up his land! Cover everything with horrid, greasy oil!
                        I&apos;ll die first!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean you&apos;ll let Elnora go like a beggar, and hurt and
                        mortify her past bearing. I&apos;ve got to the place where I tell you
                        plain what I am going to do. Maggie and I went to town last night, and we
                        got what things Elnora needs most urgent to make her look a little like the
                        rest of the high school girls. Now here it is in plain English. You can help
                        get these things ready, and let us give them to her as we want&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She won&apos;t touch them!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-067" n="58"/>
                    <p>&quot;Then you can pay us, and she can take them as her right&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I will tell Elnora just what you are worth, what you can
                        afford, and how much of this she owns. I&apos;ll loan her the money to
                        buy books and decent clothes, and when she is of age she can sell her share
                        and pay me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock gripped a chair-back and opened her lips, but no words came.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And,&quot; Sinton continued, &quot;if she is so much like
                        you that she won&apos;t do that, I &apos;ll go to the county seat
                        and lay complaint against you as her guardian before the judge.
                        I&apos;ll swear to what you are worth, and how you are raising her, and
                        have you discharged, or have the judge appoint some man who will see that
                        she is comfortable, educated and decent looking!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Youyou wouldn&apos;t!&quot; gasped Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t need to, Kate!&quot; said Sinton, his heart
                        softening the instant the hard words were said. &quot;You won&apos;t
                        show it, but you do love Elnora! You can&apos;t help it! You must see
                        how she needs things; come help us fix them, and be friends. Maggie and I
                        couldn&apos;t live without her, and you couldn&apos;t either.
                        You&apos;ve got to love such a fine girl as she is; let it show a
                        little!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can hardly expect me to love her,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock
                        coldly. &quot;But for her a man would stand back of me now, who would
                        beat the breath out of your sneaking body for the cowardly thing with which
                        you <pb id="VAA2373-068" n="59"/> threaten me. After all I&apos;ve
                        suffered you&apos;d drag me to court and compel me to tear up
                        Robert&apos;s property. If I ever go they carry me. If they touch one
                        tree, or put down one greasy old oil well, it will be over all I can shoot,
                        before they begin. Now, see how quick you can clear out of here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You won&apos;t come and help Maggie with the dress?&quot;</p>
                    <p>For answer Mrs. Comstock looked about swiftly for some object on which to lay
                        her hands. Knowing her temper, Wesley Sinton left with all the haste
                        consistent with dignity. But he did not go home. He crossed a field, and in
                        an hour brought another neighbour who was skilful with her needle. With
                        sinking heart Margaret saw them coming.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kate is too busy to help to-day, she can&apos;t sew before
                        to-morrow,&quot; said Wesley cheerfully as they entered.</p>
                    <p>That quieted Margaret&apos;s apprehension a little, though she had some
                        doubts. Wesley prepared the lunch, and by four o&apos;clock the pretty
                        dress was finished as far as it possibly could be until it was fitted on
                        Elnora. If that did not entail too much work, it could be completed in two
                        hours.</p>
                    <p>Then the neighbour left and Margaret packed their purchases into the big
                        market basket. Wesley took the hat, umbrella, and raincoat, and they went
                        down to Mrs. Comstock&apos;s. As they reached the step, Margaret spoke
                        pleasantly to Mrs. Comstock, who sat reading just inside the door, but she
                        did not answer and deliberately turned a leaf without looking up.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-069" n="60"/>
                    <p>Wesley Sinton opened the door and went in followed by Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kate,&quot; he said, &quot;you needn&apos;t take out
                        your mad over our little racket on Maggie. I ain&apos;t told her a word
                        I said to you, or you said to me. She&apos;s not so very strong, and
                        she&apos;s sewed since four o&apos;clock this morning to get this
                        dress ready for to-morrow. It&apos;s done and we came down to try it on
                        Elnora.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that the truth, Mag Sinton?&quot; demanded Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You heard Wesley say so,&quot; proudly affirmed Mrs. Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to make you a proposition,&quot; said Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait till Elnora comes. Then we&apos;ll show her the things and
                        see what she says.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would it do to see what she says without bribing her,&quot;
                        sneered Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If she can stand what she did yesterday, and will to-day, she can
                        bear&apos; most anything,&quot; said Wesley. &quot;Put away the
                        clothes if you want to, till we tell her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you don&apos;t take this waist I&apos;m working
                        on,&quot; said Margaret, &quot;for I have to baste in the sleeves
                        and set the collar. Put the rest out of sight if you like.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock picked up the basket and bundles, placed them inside her room
                        and closed the door.</p>
                    <p>Margaret threaded her needle and began to sew. Mrs. Comstock returned to her
                        book, while Wesley fidgeted and raged inwardly. He could see that Margaret
                        was nervous and almost in tears, but the lines in Mrs. Comstock&apos;s
                            <pb id="VAA2373-070" n="61"/> impassive face were set and cold. So they
                        sat and the clock ticked off the timeone hour, two, dusk, and no Elnora.
                        Margaret long since had taken the last stitch she could. Occasionally she
                        and Wesley exchanged a few words. Mrs. Comstock regularly turned a leaf, and
                        once arose and moved nearer a window. Just when Margaret and Wesley were
                        discussing whether he had not best go to town to meet Elnora, they heard her
                        coming up the walk. Wesley dropped his tilted chair and squared himself.
                        Margaret gripped her sewing, and turned pleading eyes to the door. Mrs.
                        Comstock closed her book and grimly smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother, please open the door,&quot; called Elnora.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock arose, and swung open the screen. Elnora stepped in beside her,
                        bent half double, the whole front of her dress gathered into a sort of bag
                        filled with a heavy load, and one arm stacked high with books. In the dim
                        light she did not see the Sintons.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please hand me the empty bucket in the kitchen, mother,&quot;
                        she said. &quot;I just had to bring these arrow points home, but
                        I&apos;m scared for fear I&apos;ve soiled my dress and will have to
                        wash it. I&apos;m to clean them, and take them to the banker in the
                        morning, and oh, mother, I&apos;ve sold enough stuff to pay for my
                        books, my tuition, and maybe a dress and some lighter shoes besides. Oh,
                        mother I&apos;m so happy! Take the books and bring the bucket!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she saw Margaret and Wesley. &quot;Oh, glory!&quot; she exulted.
                        &quot;I was just wondering how I&apos;d ever <pb id="VAA2373-071"
                            n="62"/> wait to tell you, and here you are! It&apos;s too perfectly
                        splendid to be true!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell us, Elnora,&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Elnora, doubling down on the floor and
                        spreading out her skirt, &quot;set the bucket here, mother. These points
                        are brittle and have to be put in one at a time. If they are chipped I
                        can&apos;t sell them. Well, sir! I&apos;ve had a time! You know I
                        just had to have books. I tried three stores, and they wouldn&apos;t
                        trust me, not even three days, I didn&apos;t know what in this world I
                        could do quickly enough. Just when I was about frantic I saw a sign in a
                        bank window asking for caterpillars, cocoons, butterflies, arrow points, and
                        everything. I went in, and it was this Bird Woman wants the insects, and the
                        banker wants the stones. I had to go to school then, but, if you&apos;ll
                        believe it&quot;Elnora beamed on all of them in turn as she talked and
                        slipped the arrow points from her dress to the pail&quot;if
                        you&apos;ll believe itbut you won&apos;t, hardly, until you look at
                        the booksthere was the mathematics teacher, waiting at his door, and he had
                        a set of books for me that he had telephoned a Sophomore to bring.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did he happen to do that, Elnora?&quot; interrupted Sinton.</p>
                    <p>Elnora blushed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was a fool mistake I made yesterday in thinking books were just
                        handed out to you. There was a teachers&apos; meeting last night and the
                        history teacher told about that. Professor Henley thought it was me.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-072" n="63"/>
                    <p>You know I told you what he said about my algebra, mother. Ain&apos;t I
                        glad I studied out some of it myself this summer! So he just telephoned and
                        a girl brought the books. Because they are marked and abused some I get the
                        whole outfit for two dollars. I can erase most of the marks, paste down the
                        covers, and fix them so they look better. But I must hurry to the joy part.
                        I didn&apos;t stop to eat, at noon, I just ran to the Bird
                        Woman&apos;s, and I had lunch with her. It was salad, hot chocolate, and
                        lovely things, and she wants to buy most every old scrap I ever gathered.
                        She wants dragon flies, moths, butterflies, and hethe banker, I meanwants
                        everything Indian. This very night she came to the swamp with me and took
                        away enough stuff to pay for the books and tuition, and to-morrow she is
                        going to buy some more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora laid the last arrow point in the pail and arose, shaking leaves and
                        bits of baked earth from her dress. She reached into her pocket and produced
                        her money and waved it before their wondering eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And that&apos;s the joy part!&quot; she exulted.
                        &quot;Put it up in the clock till morning, mother. That pays for the
                        books and tuition and&quot; Elnora hesitated, for she saw the nervous
                        grasp with which her mother&apos;s fingers closed on the bills. Then she
                        went on, but more slowly and thinking before she spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What I get to-morrow pays for more books and tuition, and maybe a
                        few, just a few, things to wear. These shoes are so dreadfully heavy and
                        hot, and they make <pb id="VAA2373-073" n="64"/> such a noise on the floor.
                        There isn&apos;t another calico dress in the whole building, not among
                        hundreds of us. Why what is that? Aunt Margaret, what are you hiding in your
                        lap?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She snatched the waist and shook it out, and her face was beaming.
                        &quot;Have you taken to waists all fancy and buttoned in the back? I bet
                        you this is mine!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet you so, too,&quot; said Margaret Sinton. &quot;You
                        undress right away and try it on, and if it fits, it will be done for
                        morning. There are some low shoes, too!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora began to dance. &quot;Oh, you dear people!&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;I can pay for them to-morrow night! Isn&apos;t it too
                        splendid! I was just thinking on the way home that I certainly would be
                        compelled to have cooler shoes until later, and I was wondering what
                        I&apos;d do when the fall rains begin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I meant to get you some heavy dress skirts and a coat
                        then,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know you said so!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;But you
                        needn&apos;t now! I can get every single stitch I need myself. Next
                        summer I can gather up a lot more stuff, and all winter on the way to
                        school. I am sure I can sell ferns, I know I can nuts, and the Bird Woman
                        says the grade rooms want leaves, grasses, birds&apos; nests, and
                        cocoons. Oh, isn&apos;t this world lovely! I&apos;ll be helping with
                        the tax, next, mother!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora waved the waist and started for the bedroom. When she opened the door
                        she gave a little cry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have you people been doing?&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-074" n="65"/>
                    <p>&quot;I never saw so many interesting bundles in all my, life.
                        I&apos;m &apos;skeered&apos; to death for fear I can&apos;t
                        pay for all of them, and will have to give up something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wouldn&apos;t you take them, if you could not pay for them,
                        Elnora?&quot; asked her mother instantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, not unless you did,&quot; answered Elnora.
                        &quot;People have no right to wear things they can&apos;t afford,
                        have they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But from such old friends as Maggie and Wesley!&quot; Mrs.
                        Comstock&apos;s voice was oily with triumph.</p>
                    <p>&quot;From them least of all,&quot; cried Elnora stoutly.
                        &quot;From a stranger sooner than from them, to whom I owe so much more
                        than I ever can pay now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you don&apos;t have to,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;Maggie just selected these things, because she is more in touch
                        with the world, and has got such good taste. You can pay as long as your
                        money holds out, and if there&apos;s more necessary, maybe I can sell
                        the butcher a calf, or if there&apos;s things too costly for us, of
                        course, they can take them back. Anything that ain&apos;t used can be
                        returned. They were only brought here on trial. Put on the waist now, and
                        then you can look over the rest and see if they are suitable, and what you
                        want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora stepped into the adjoining room and closed the door. Mrs. Comstock
                        picked up the bucket and started for the well with it. At the bedroom she
                        paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora, were you going to wash these arrow points?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. The Bird Woman says they sell better if <pb id="VAA2373-075"
                            n="66"/> they are clean, so it can be seen that there are no defects in
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Some of them
                        seem quite baked. Shall I put them to soak? Do you want to take them in the
                        morning?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;If you would just
                        fill the pail with water.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock left the room. Wesley Sinton sat with his back to the window in
                        the west end of the cabin which overlooked the well. A suppressed sound
                        behind him caused him to turn quickly. Then he arose and leaned over
                        Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s out there laughing like a blamed monkey!&quot;
                        he whispered indignantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, she can&apos;t help it!&quot; exclaimed Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going home!&quot; said Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no, you are not!&quot; retorted Margaret. &quot;You are
                        missing the point. The point is not how you look, or feel. It is to get
                        these things in Elnora&apos;s possession past dispute. You go now, and
                        to-morrow Elnora will wear calico, and Kate Comstock will return these
                        goods. Right here I stay until everything we bought is
                        Elnora&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; asked Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll have to watch me,&quot; said Margaret.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t know yet, myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she arose and peered from the window. At the well curb stood Katharine
                        Comstock. The strain of the day was finding reaction. Her chin was in the
                        air, she was heaving, shaking and strangling to suppress <pb
                            id="VAA2373-076" n="67"/> any sound. The word that slipped between
                        Margaret Sinton&apos;s lips shocked Wesley until he dropped on his
                        chair, and recalled her to her senses. She was fairly composed as she turned
                        to Elnora, and began the fitting. When she had pinched, pulled, and patted
                        she called, &quot;Come see if you think this fits, Kate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock had gone around to the back door and answered from the kitchen.
                        &quot;You know more about it than I do. Go ahead! I&apos;m getting
                        supper. Don&apos;t forget to allow for what it will shrink in
                        washing!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I set the colors and washed the goods last night; it can be made to
                        fit right now,&quot; answered Margaret past the pins between her teeth.</p>
                    <p>When she could find nothing more to alter she told Elnora to see how quickly
                        she could heat a pail of water. After she had done that the girl began
                        opening packages.</p>
                    <p>The hat came first.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;Mother, of course, you
                        have seen this, but you haven&apos;t seen it on me. I must try it
                        on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you dare put that on your head until your hair is
                        washed and properly combed,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;Is that water to wash my
                        hair? I thought it was to set the color in another dress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you thought wrong,&quot; said Margaret simply.
                        &quot;Your hair is going to be washed and brushed until it shines like
                        copper. While it dries you can eat your supper, and this dress will be
                        finished. Then you can <pb id="VAA2373-077" n="68"/> put on your new ribbon,
                        and your hat. You can try your shoes now, and if they don&apos;t fit,
                        you and Wesley can drive to town and change them. That little round bundle
                        on the top of the basket is your stockings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret sat down and began sewing swiftly, and a little later opened the
                        machine, and ran several long seams.</p>
                    <p>Elnora was back in a few minutes holding up her skirts and stepping daintily
                        in the beautiful new shoes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t soil them, honey, else you&apos;re sure they
                        fit,&quot; cautioned Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They seem just a trifle large, maybe,&quot; said Elnora
                        dubiously, and Wesley got down to feel. He and Margaret thought them a fit,
                        and then Elnora appealed to her mother. Mrs. Comstock appeared wiping her
                        hands on her apron. She examined the shoes critically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They seem to fit,&quot; she said, &quot;but they are away
                        too fine to walk country roads.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think so, too,&quot; said Elnora instantly. &quot;We had
                        better take these back and get a cheaper pair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, let them go for this time,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;They are so pretty, I hate to part with them. You can get cheaper
                        ones after this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley and Margaret scarcely breathed for a long time.</p>
                    <p>Then Wesley went to do the feeding. Elnora set the table. When the water was
                        hot, Margaret pinned a big towel around Elnora&apos;s shoulders and
                        washed and dried the lovely hair according to the instructions she <pb
                            id="VAA2373-078" n="69"/> had been given the previous night. As the hair
                        began to dry it billowed out in a sparkling sheen that caught the light and
                        gleamed and flashed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, the idea is to let it stand naturally, just as the curl will
                        make it. Don&apos;t you do any of that nasty, untidy snarling,
                        Elnora,&quot; cautioned Margaret. &quot;Wash it this way every two
                        weeks while you are in school, shake it out, and dry it. Then part it in the
                        middle and turn a front quarter on each side from your face. You tie the
                        back at your neck with a stringso, and the ribbon goes in a big, loose bow.
                        I&apos;ll show you.&quot; One after another Margaret Sinton tied the
                        ribbons, creasing each of them so they could not be returned, as she
                        explained that she was trying to see which was most becoming. Then she
                        produced the raincoat which carried Elnora into transports.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock objected. &quot;That won&apos;t be warm enough for cold
                        weather, and you can&apos;t afford it and a coat, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell you what I thought,&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;I was planning on the way home. These coats are fine because they
                        keep you dry. I thought I would get one, and a warm sweater to wear under it
                        cold days. Then you always would be dry, and warm, too. The sweater only
                        costs three dollars, so I could get it and the raincoat both for half the
                        price of a heavy cloth coat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are right about that,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;You can change more with the weather, too. Keep the raincoat,
                        Elnora.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-079" n="70"/>
                    <p>&quot;Wear it until you try the hat,&quot; said Margaret.
                        &quot;It will have to do until the dress is finished.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora picked up the hat dubiously. &quot;Mother, may I wear my hair as
                        it is now?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me take a good look,&quot; said Katharine Comstock. Heaven
                        only knows what she saw. To Wesley and to Margaret the bright young face of
                        Elnora, with its pink tints, its heavy dark brows, its bright blue-gray
                        eyes, and its frame of curling reddish brown hair was the sweetest sight on
                        earth, and at that instant Elnora was radiant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So long as it&apos;s your own hair, and combed back as plain as
                        it will go, I don&apos;t suppose it cuts much ice whether it&apos;s
                        tied a little tighter or looser,&quot; conceded Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;If you stop right there, you may let it go at that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora set the hat on her head. It was just a wide tan straw with three
                        exquisite peacock quills at one side. Margaret Sinton cried out, Wesley
                        slapped his knee and sighed like a blast, and Mrs. Comstock stood speechless
                        for a second.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you had asked the price before you put that on,&quot;
                        she said impatiently. &quot;We never can afford it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s not so much as you think,&quot; said Margaret.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t you see what I did? I had them take off the quills,
                        and I put on some of those Phoebe Simms gave me from her peacocks. The hat
                        will only cost you a dollar and a half.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-080" n="71"/>
                    <p>She avoided Wesley&apos;s eyes, and looked straight at Mrs. Comstock.
                        Elnora removed the hat to examine it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, they are those reddish tan quills of yours!&quot; she
                        cried. &quot;Mother, look how beautifully they are set on! I think they
                        are fine. I&apos;d much rather have them than those from the
                        store.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So would I,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;If Margaret
                        wants to spare them, that will make you a beautiful hat; dirt cheap, too!
                        You must go past Mrs. Simms and show her. She would be pleased to see
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora sank into a chair because she couldn&apos;t stand any longer and
                        contemplated her toe. &quot;Landy, ain&apos;t I a queen?&quot;
                        she murmured. &quot;What else have I got?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just a belt, some handkerchiefs, and a pair of top shoes for rainy
                        days and colder weather,&quot; said Margaret, handing over parcels.</p>
                    <p>&quot;About those high shoes, that was my idea,&quot; said Wesley.
                        &quot;Soon as it rains, low shoes won&apos;t do, and by taking two
                        pairs at once I could get them some cheaper. The low ones are two and the
                        high ones two fifty, together three seventy-five. Ain&apos;t that
                        cheap?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a real bargain,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock,
                        &quot;if they are good shoes, and they look it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This,&quot; said Wesley, producing the last package,
                        &quot;is your Christmas present from your Aunt Maggie. I got mine, too,
                        but it&apos;s at the house. I&apos;ll bring it up in the
                        morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He handed Margaret the umbrella, and she passed it over to Elnora who opened
                        it and sat laughing under <pb id="VAA2373-081" n="72"/> its shelter. Then
                        she kissed both of them. She got a pencil and a slip of paper and set down
                        the prices they gave her of everything they had brought except the umbrella,
                        added the sum, and said laughingly, &quot;Will you please wait till
                        to-morrow for the money? I will have it then, sure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora,&quot; said Wesley Sinton. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t
                        you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora, hustle here a minute!&quot; called Mrs. Comstock from
                        the kitchen. &quot;I need you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;One second, mother,&quot; answered Elnora, throwing off the
                        coat and hat, and closing the umbrella as she ran. There were several
                        errands to do in a hurry, and then supper. Elnora chattered incessantly,
                        Wesley and Margaret talked all they could, while Mrs. Comstock said a word
                        now and then, which was all she ever did. But Welsey Sinton was watching
                        her, and time and again he saw a peculiar little twist around her mouth. He
                        knew that for the first time in sixteen years she really was laughing over
                        something. She had all she could do to preserve her usually sober face.
                        Wesley knew what she was thinking.</p>
                    <p>After supper the dress was finished, the plans for the next one discussed,
                        and then the Sintons went home. Elnora gathered her treasures.</p>
                    <p>As she started for the stairs she stopped. &quot;May I kiss you
                        good-night, mother?&quot; she asked lightly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind any slobbering,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;I should think you&apos;d lived with me long enough to know
                        that I don&apos;t care for it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-082" n="73"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;d love to show you in some way how happy I am, and
                        how I thank you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder what for?&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Mag
                        Sinton picked that stuff and brought it here and you pay for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but you seemed willing for me to have it, and you said you
                        would help me if I couldn&apos;t pay all,&quot; insisted Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe I did,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Maybe I did. I
                        meant to get you some heavy dress skirts about Thanksgiving, and I still can
                        get them. Go to bed, and for any sake don&apos;t begin mooning before a
                        mirror, and make a dunce of yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock picked up several papers and blew out the kitchen light. She
                        stood in the middle of the sitting-room floor for a time and then went into
                        her room and closed the door. Sitting on the edge of the bed she thought for
                        a few minutes and then suddenly buried her face in the pillow and again
                        heaved with laughter.</p>
                    <p>Down the road plodded Margaret and Wesley Sinton. Neither of them had words
                        to utter their united thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Done!&quot; hissed Wesley at last. &quot;Done brown! Did
                        you ever feel like a bloomin&apos;, confounded donkey? How did the woman
                        do it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She didn&apos;t do it!&quot; gulped Margaret through her
                        tears. &quot;She didn&apos;t do anything. She just trusted to
                        Elnora&apos;s great big soul to bring her out right, and really she was
                        right, and so it had to bring her. She&apos;s a <pb id="VAA2373-083"
                            n="74"/> darling, Wesley! But she&apos;s got a time before her. Did
                        you see Kate Comstock grab that money? Before six months she&apos;ll be
                        out combing the Limberlost for bugs and arrow points to help pay the tax. I
                        know her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t!&quot; exclaimed Sinton,
                        &quot;She&apos;s too many for me. But there is a laugh left in her
                        yet! I didn&apos;t s&apos;pose there was. Bet you a dollar, if we
                        could see her this minute, she&apos;d be chuckling over the way we got
                        left.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Both of them stopped in the road and looked back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s Elnora&apos;s light in her room,&quot;
                        said Margaret. &quot;The poor child will feel those clothes, and pore
                        over her books till morning, but she&apos;ll look decent to go to
                        school, anyway. Nothing is too big a price to pay for that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, if Kate lets her wear them. Ten to one, she makes her finish
                        the week with that old stuff!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, she won&apos;t,&quot; said Margaret. &quot;She
                        don&apos;t dare. Kate made some concessions, all right; big ones for
                        herif she did get her way in the main. She bent some, and if Elnora proves
                        that she can walk out barehanded in the morning and come back with that much
                        money in her pocket, an armful of books, and buy a turnout like that, she
                        proves that she is of some consideration, and Kate&apos;s smart enough.
                        She&apos;ll think twice before she&apos;ll do that. Elnora
                        won&apos;t wear a calico dress to high school again. You watch and see
                        if she does. She may have got the best clothes she&apos;ll get for a
                        time, for the least money, but she won&apos;t know it until she tries to
                        buy <pb id="VAA2373-084" n="75"/> goods herself at the same rates. Wesley,
                        what about those prices? Didn&apos;t they shrink considerable?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You began it,&quot; said Wesley. &quot;Those prices were
                        all right. We didn&apos;t say what the goods cost us, we said what they
                        would cost her. Surely, she&apos;s mistaken about being able to pay all
                        that. Can she pick up stuff of that value around the Limberlost?
                        Didn&apos;t the Bird Woman see her trouble, and just give her the
                        money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think so,&quot; said Margaret. &quot;Seems
                        to me I&apos;ve heard of her paying, or offering to pay them that would
                        take the money, for bugs and butterflies, and I&apos;ve known people who
                        sold that banker Indian stuff. Once I heard that his pipe collection beat
                        that of the Government at the Philadelphia Centennial. Those things have
                        come to have a value.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, there&apos;s about a bushel of that kind of valuables
                        piled up in the woodshed, that belongs to Elnora. At least, I picked them up
                        because she said she wanted them. Ain&apos;t it queer that
                        she&apos;d take to stones, bugs, and butterflies, and save them. Now
                        they are going to bring her the very thing she wants the worst. Lord, but
                        this is a funny world when you get to studying! Looks like things
                        didn&apos;t all come by accident. Looks as if there was a plan back of
                        it, and somebody driving that knows the road, and how to handle the lines.
                        Anyhow, Elnora&apos;s in the wagon, and when I get out in the night and
                        the dark closes around me, and I see the stars, I don&apos;t feel so
                        cheap. Maggie, how the nation did Kate Comstock do that?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-085" n="76"/>
                    <p>&quot;You will keep on harping, Wesley. I told you she didn&apos;t do
                        it. Elnora did it! She walked in and took things right out of our hands. All
                        Kate had to do was to enjoy having it go her way, and she was cute enough to
                        put in a few questions that sort of guided Elnora. But I don&apos;t
                        know, Wesley. This thing makes me think, too. S&apos;pose we&apos;d
                        got Elnora when she was a baby, and we&apos;d heaped on her all the love
                        we can&apos;t on our own, and we&apos;d coddled, petted, and
                        shielded her, would she have made the woman that living alone, learning to
                        think for herself, and taking all the knocks Kate Comstock could give, have
                        made of her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You bet your life!&quot; cried Wesley, warmly. &quot;Loving
                        anybody don&apos;t hurt them. We wouldn&apos;t have done anything
                        but love her. You can&apos;t hurt a child loving it. She&apos;d have
                        learned to work, be sensible, study, and grown into a woman with us, without
                        suffering like a poor homeless dog.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you don&apos;t get the point, Wesley. She would have grown
                        into a fine woman with us; just seems as if Elnora was born to be fine, but
                        as we would have raised her, would her heart ever have known the world as it
                        does now? Where&apos;s the anguish, Wesley, that child can&apos;t
                        comprehend? Seeing what she&apos;s seen of her mother hasn&apos;t
                        hardened her. She can understand any mother&apos;s sorrow. Living life
                        from the rough side has only broadened her. Where&apos;s the girl or boy
                        burning with shame, or struggling to find a way, that will cross
                        Elnora&apos;s path and not get a lift from her? <pb id="VAA2373-086"
                            n="77"/> She&apos;s had the knocks, but there&apos;ll never be
                        any of the thing you call &quot;false pride&apos; in her. I guess we
                        better keep out. Maybe Kate Comstock knows what she&apos;s doing. Sure
                        as you live, Elnora has grown bigger on knocks than she would on
                        love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t s&apos;pose there ever was a very fine point
                        to anything but I missed it,&quot; said Wesley, &quot;because I am
                        blunt, rough, and have no book learning to speak of. Since you put it into
                        words I see what you mean, but it&apos;s dinged hard on Elnora, just the
                        same. And I don&apos;t keep out. I keep watching closer than ever. I got
                        my slap in the face, but if I don&apos;t miss my guess, Kate Comstock
                        learned her lesson, same as I did. She learned that I was in earnest, that I
                        would haul her to court if she didn&apos;t loosen up a bit, and
                        she&apos;ll loosen. You see if she don&apos;t. It may come hard, and
                        the hinges creak, but she&apos;ll fix Elnora decent after this, if
                        Elnora don&apos;t prove that she can fix herself. As for me, I found out
                        that what I was doing was as much for myself as for Elnora. I wanted her to
                        take those things from us, and love us for giving them. It didn&apos;t
                        work, and but for you, I&apos;d messed the whole thing and stuck like a
                        pig crossing a bridge. But you helped me out; Elnora&apos;s got the
                        clothes, and by morning, maybe I won&apos;t grudge Kate the only laugh
                        she&apos;s had in sixteen years. You been showing me the way quite a
                        spell now, ain&apos;t you, Maggie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then they went out of the night, and lay down together with
                        Margaret&apos;s hand just touching Wesley&apos;s sleeve.</p>
                    <p>Up in the attic Elnora lighted two candles, set them <pb id="VAA2373-087"
                            n="78"/> on her little table, stacked the books, and put away the
                        precious clothes. How lovingly she hung the hat and umbrella, folded the
                        raincoat, and spread the new dress over a chair. She fingered the ribbons,
                        and tried to smooth the creases from them. She put away the hose neatly
                        folded, touched the handkerchiefs, and tried the belt. Then she slipped into
                        her little white nightdress, shook down her hair that it might become
                        thoroughly dry, set a chair before the table, and reverently opened one of
                        the books. A stiff draught swept the attic, for it stretched the length of
                        the cabin, and had a window in each end. Elnora arose and going to the east
                        window closed it. She stood for a minute looking at the stars, the sky, and
                        the dark outline of the straggling trees of the rapidly dismantling
                        Limberlost. In the region of her case a tiny point of light flashed and
                        disappeared. Elnora straightened and wondered. Was it wise to leave her
                        precious money there? The light flashed once more, wavered a few seconds,
                        and died out. The girl waited. She did not see it again, and so she went
                        back to her books.</p>
                    <p>In the Limberlost the hulking figure of a man slouched down the trail.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Bird Woman was at Freckles&apos;s room this
                        evening,&quot;he muttered. &quot;Wonder what for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He left the trail, entered the enclosure still distinctly outlined and
                        approached the case. The first point of light flashed from the tiny electric
                        lamp on his vest. He took a duplicate key from his pocket, felt for the <pb
                            id="VAA2373-088" n="79"/> padlock and opened it. The door swung wide.
                        The light flashed the second time. Swiftly his glance swept the interior.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Bout a fourth of her moths gone. Elnora must have been
                        with the Bird Woman and given them to her.&quot; Then he stood tense.
                        His keen eyes discovered the roll of bills hastily thrust back in the bottom
                        of the case. He snatched them up, shut off the light, relocked the case by
                        touch, and swiftly went down the trail. Every few seconds he paused and
                        listened intently. Just as he reached the road, the low hoot of a screech
                        owl, waveringly prolonged, fell on his ears, and he stopped. An instant
                        later a second figure approached him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it you, Pete?&quot; came the whispered question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the first man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was coming down to take a peep, when I saw your flash,&quot;
                        he said. &quot;I heard the Bird Woman had been at the case to-day.
                        Anything doing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Not a thing,&quot; said Pete. &quot;She just took away about a fourth
                        of the moths. Probably had the Comstock girl getting them for her. Heard
                        they were together. Likely she&apos;ll get the rest to-morrow.
                        Ain&apos;t picking gettin&apos; bare these days?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I should say so,&quot; said the second man, turning back
                        in disgust. &quot;Coming home, now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I am going down this way,&quot; answered Pete, for his eyes
                        caught the gleam from the window of the Comstock cabin, and he had a desire
                        to learn why Elnora&apos;s attic was lighted at that hour.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-089" n="80"/>
                    <p>He slouched down the road, occasionally feeling the size of the roll he had
                        not taken time to count. He chuckled frequently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Feels fat enough to pay,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Bill, I
                        beat you just about seven minutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The attic was too long, the light too near the other end, and the cabin stood
                        much too far back from the road. He could see nothing although he climbed
                        the fence and walked back opposite the window. He knew Mrs. Comstock was
                        probably awake, and that she sometimes went to the swamp behind her home at
                        night. At times a cry went up from that locality that paralyzed anyone near,
                        or sent them fleeing as if for life. He did not care to cross behind the
                        cabin. He returned to the road, passed, and again climbed the fence.
                        Opposite the west window he could see Elnora. She sat before a small table
                        reading from a book between two candles. Her hair fell in a bright sheen
                        around her, and with one hand she lightly shook, and tossed it as she
                        studied. The man stood out in the night and watched.</p>
                    <p>For a long time a leaf turned occasionally and the hair-drying went on. The
                        man drew nearer. The picture grew more beautiful as he approached. He could
                        not see as well as he desired, for the screen was of white mosquito netting,
                        and it angered him. He cautiously crept closer. The elevation shut off his
                        view. Then he remembered the great willow tree shading the well and
                        branching across the window at the west end of the cabin. From childhood
                        Elnora had stepped from <pb id="VAA2373-090" n="81"/> the sill to a limb and
                        slid down the slanting trunk of the tree. He reached it and noiselessly
                        swung himself up. Three steps out on the big limb the man shuddered. He was
                        within a few feet of the girl.</p>
                    <p>He could see the throb of her breast under its thin covering and smell the
                        fragrance of the tossing hair. He could see the narrow bed with its pieced
                        calico cover, the whitewashed walls with gay lithographs, and every crevice
                        stuck full of twigs with dangling cocoons. There were pegs for the few
                        clothes, the old chest, the little table, the two chairs, the uneven floor
                        covered with rag rugs, and braided corn husk. But nothing was worth a glance
                        save the perfect face and form within reach by one spring through the rotten
                        mosquito bar. He gripped the limb above that on which he stood, licked his
                        lips, and breathed through his throat to be sure he was making no sound.
                        Elnora closed the book and laid it aside. She picked up a towel, and turning
                        the gathered ends of her hair rubbed them across it, and dropping the towel
                        on her lap, tossed the hair again. Then she sat in deep thought. By and by
                        words began to come softly. Near as he was the man could not hear at first.
                        He bent closer and listened intently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;ever could be so happy,&quot; murmured the soft voice.
                        &quot;The dress is so pretty, such shoes, the coat and everything. I
                        won&apos;t have to be ashamed again, not ever again, for the Limberlost
                        is full of precious moths, and I always can collect them. The Bird Woman
                        will buy more to-morrow, and the next day, and the next. When <pb
                            id="VAA2373-091" n="82"/> they are all gone, I can spend every minute
                        gathering cocoons, and hunting other things I can sell. Oh, thank God, for
                        my precious, precious money. Why, I didn&apos;t pray in vain after all!
                        I thought when I asked the Lord to hide me, there in that big hall, that He
                        wasn&apos;t doing it, because I wasn&apos;t covered from sight that
                        instant. But I&apos;m hidden now, I feel that.&quot; Elnora lifted
                        her eyes to the beams above her. &quot;I don&apos;t know much about
                        praying properly,&quot; she muttered, &quot;but I do thank you,
                        Lord, for hiding me in your own time and way&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her face was so bright that it shone with a white radiance. Two big tears
                        welled from her eyes, and rolled down her smiling cheeks. &quot;Oh, I do
                        feel that you have hidden me,&quot; she breathed. Then she blew out the
                        lights, and the little wooden bed creaked under her weight.</p>
                    <p>Pete Corson dropped from the limb and found his way to the road. He stood
                        still a long time, then started back to the Limberlost. A tiny point of
                        light flashed in the region of the case. He stopped with an oath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Another hound trying to steal from a girl,&quot; he exclaimed.
                        &quot;But it&apos;s likely he thinks if he gets anything it will be
                        from a woman who can afford it, as I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went on, but beside the fences, and very cautiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Swamp seems to be alive to-night,&quot; he muttered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s three of us out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He entered a deep place at the northwest corner, sat <pb id="VAA2373-092"
                            n="83"/> on the ground and taking a pencil from his pocket, he tore a
                        leaf from a little notebook, and laboriously wrote a few lines by the light
                        he carried. Then he went back to the region of the case and waited. Before
                        his eyes swept the vision of the slender white creature with tossing hair.
                        He smiled, and worshipped it, until a distant rooster faintly announced
                        dawn.</p>
                    <p>Then he unlocked the case again, and replaced the money, laid the note upon
                        it, and went back to concealment, where he remained until Elnora came down
                        the trail in the morning, looking very lovely in her new dress and hat.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> would be difficult to describe just how happy Elnora
                        was that morning as she hurried through her work, bathed and put on the
                        neat, dainty gingham dress, and the tan shoes. She had a struggle with her
                        hair. It crinkled, billowed, and shone, and she could not avoid seeing the
                        becoming frame it made around her face. But in deference to her
                        mother&apos;s feelings the girl set her teeth, and bound her hair close
                        to her head with a shoe-string. &quot;Not to be changed at the
                        case,&quot; she told herself.</p>
                    <p>That her mother was watching she was unaware. just as she picked up the
                        beautiful brown ribbon Mrs. Comstock spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You had better let me tie that. You can&apos;t reach behind
                        yourself and do it right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora gave a little gasp. Her mother never before had proposed to do
                        anything for the girl that by any possibility she could do herself. Her
                        heart quaked at the thought of how her mother would arrange that bow, but
                        Elnora dared not refuse. The offer was too precious. It might never be made
                        again.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-094" n="85"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, thank you!&quot; said the girl, and sitting down she held
                        out the ribbon.</p>
                    <p>Her mother stood back and looked at her critically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t got that like Mag Sinton had it last
                        night,&quot; she announced. &quot;You little idiot! You&apos;ve
                        tried to plaster it down to suit me, and you missed it. I liked it away
                        better as Mag fixed it, after I saw it. You didn&apos;t look so
                        peeled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, mother, mother!&quot; laughed Elnora, with a half sob in
                        her voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold still, will you?&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll be late, and I haven&apos;t packed your dinner
                        yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She untied the string and shook out the hair. It rose with electricity and
                        clung to her fingers and hands. Mrs. Comstock jumped back as if bitten. She
                        knew that touch. Her face grew white, and her eyes angry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tie it yourself,&quot; she said shortly, &quot;and then
                        I&apos;ll put on the ribbon. But roll it back loose like Mag did. It
                        looked so pretty that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Almost fainting Elnora stood before the glass, divided off the front parts of
                        her hair, and rolled them as Mrs. Sinton had done; tied it at the nape of
                        her neck, then sat while her mother arranged the ribbon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I pull it down till it comes tight in these creases where she
                        had it, it will be just right won&apos;t it?&quot; queried Mrs.
                        Comstock, and the amazed Elnora stammered &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she looked in the glass the bow was perfectly <pb id="VAA2373-095"
                            n="86"/> tied, and how the gold tone of the brown did match the lustre
                        of the shining hair! &quot;That&apos;s awful pretty,&quot;
                        commented Mrs. Comstock&apos;s soul, but her stiff lips had said all
                        that could be forced from them for once. Just then Wesley Sinton came to the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; he cried heartily. &quot;Elnora, you
                        look a picture! My, but you&apos;re sweet! If any of them city boys get
                        sassy you tell your Uncle Wesley, and he&apos;ll horsewhip them.
                        Here&apos;s your Christmas present from me.&quot; He handed Elnora
                        the leather lunch box, with her name carved across the strap in artistic
                        lettering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Uncle Wesley!&quot; and that was all Elnora could say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your Aunt Maggie filled it for me for a starter,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Now, if you are ready, I&apos;m going to drive past your way
                        and you can ride almost to Onabasha with me, and save the new shoes that
                        much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora was staring at the box. &quot;Oh, I hope it isn&apos;t
                        impolite to open it before you,&quot; she said. &quot;I just feel as
                        if I must see inside.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you stand on no formality with the
                        neighbors,&quot; laughed Sinton. &quot;Look at your box if you want
                        to!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora slipped the strap and turned back the lid.</p>
                    <p>This disclosed the knife, fork, napkin, and spoon, the milk flask, and the
                        interior packed with dainty sandwiches wrapped in tissue paper, and the
                        little compartments for meat, salad, and the custard cup.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, mother!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;Oh, mother,
                        isn&apos;t it fine? What made you think of it, Uncle Wesley? How <pb
                            id="VAA2373-096" n="87"/> will I ever thank you? No one will have a
                        finer lunch box than I. Oh, I do thank you! That&apos;s the nicest gift
                        I ever had. How I love Christmas in September!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a mighty handy thing,&quot; assented Mrs.
                        Comstock, taking in every detail with sharp eyes. &quot;I guess you are
                        glad now you went and helped Mag and Wesley when you could,
                        Elnora?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deedy, yes,&quot; laughed Elnora, &quot;and I&apos;m
                        going again first time they have a big day if I stay out of school to do
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll do no such thing!&quot; said the delighted
                        Sinton. &quot;Come now, if you&apos;re going!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I ride, can you spare me time to run into the swamp to my box
                        just a minute?&quot; asked Elnora.</p>
                    <p>The light she had seen the previous night troubled her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Wesley largely. He was having such a good time
                        nothing could hurry him. So they drove away and left a white-faced woman
                        watching them from the door, her heart just a little sorer than usual.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d give a pretty to hear what he&apos;ll say to
                        her!&quot; she said bitterly. &quot;Always sticking in, always doing
                        things I can&apos;t ever afford. Where on earth did he get that thing
                        and what did it cost?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she entered the cabin and began the day&apos;s work, but mingled
                        with the brooding bitterness of her soul was the vision of a sweet young
                        face, glad with a gladness never before seen on it, and over and over she
                        repeated, &quot;I wonder what he&apos;ll say to her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>What he said was that she looked as fresh and sweet <pb id="VAA2373-097"
                            n="88"/> as a posy, and to be careful not to step in the mud or scratch
                        her shoe when she went to the case.</p>
                    <p>Elnora found her key and opened the door. Not where she had placed it, but
                        conspicuously in front lay her little heap of bills, and a crude scrawl of
                        writing beside it. Elnora picked up the note in astonishment. <text>

                    <p>Elnora began to tremble. She hastily glanced about. The damp earth before the
                        case had been trodden by large, roughly shod feet. She caught up the money
                        and the note, thrust them into her guimpe, locked the case, and ran for the
                        road.</p>
                    <p>She was so breathless and her face so white Sinton noticed it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What in the world&apos;s the matter, Elnora?&quot; he asked
                        as he helped her into the carriage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am half afraid!&quot; she panted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tut, tut, child!&quot; said Wesley Sinton. &quot;Nothing in
                        the world to be afraid of. What happened?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Uncle Wesley,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;I had more money
                        than I brought home last night, and I put it in my case. Someone has been
                        there. The ground is all trampled, and they left this note.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And took your money, I&apos;ll wager,&quot; said Sinton
                        angrily.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-098" n="89"/>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;Read the note and, oh,
                        Uncle Wesley, tell me what it means!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton&apos;s face was a study. &quot;I don&apos;t know what it
                        means,&quot; he said. &quot;Only one thing is clear. It means some
                        beast who doesn&apos;t really want to harm you, has got his eye on you,
                        and he is telling you plain as he can, not to give him a chance. You got to
                        keep along the roads, in the open, and not let the biggest moth that ever
                        flew toll you out of hearing of us, or your mother. It means that, plain and
                        distinct.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just when I can sell them! Just when everything is so lovely on
                        account of them! I can&apos;t! I can&apos;t stay away from the
                        swamp. The Limberlost is going to buy the books, the clothes, pay the
                        tuition, and even start a college fund. I just can&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve got to,&quot; said Sinton. &quot;This is
                        plain enough. You go far in the swamp at your own risk, even in
                        daytime.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Uncle Wesley,&quot; said the girl in a whisper, &quot;last
                        night before I went to bed, I was so happy I tried to pray, and I thanked
                        God for hiding me &quot;under the shadow of His wing.&apos; But how
                        in the world could anyone know it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley Sinton&apos;s heart gave one great leap in his breast. His face
                        was whiter than the girl&apos;s now.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was you praying out loud, honey?&quot; he almost whispered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might have said words,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;I
                        know I do sometimes. I&apos;ve never had anyone to talk <pb
                            id="VAA2373-099" n="90"/> to, and I&apos;ve played with and talked
                        to myself all my life. You&apos;ve caught me at it often, but it always
                        makes mother angry when she does. She says it&apos;s silly. I forget and
                        do it, when I&apos;m alone. But, Uncle Wesley, if I said anything last
                        night, you know it was the merest whisper, because I&apos;d have been so
                        afraid of waking mother. Don&apos;t you see? I sat up late, and did two
                        lessons.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton was steadying himself. &quot;I&apos;ll stop and examine the
                        case as I come back,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe I can find some
                        clue. That otherthat was just accidental. It&apos;s a common expression.
                        All the preachers use it. If I was going to pray, that would be the very
                        first thing I&apos;d say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The colour came back to Elnora&apos;s face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you tell your mother about this money, Elnora?&quot; he
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I didn&apos;t,&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;It&apos;s dreadful not to, but I was afraid. You see they are
                        clearing the swamp so fast. Every year it grows harder to find things, and
                        Indian stuff gets scarcer. I want to graduate, and that&apos;s four
                        years unless I can double on the course. That means twenty dollars tuition
                        each year, and new books, and clothes. There won&apos;t ever be so much
                        at one time again, that I know. I just got to hang to my money. I was afraid
                        to tell her, for fear she would want it for taxes, and she really must sell
                        a tree or some cattle for that, mustn&apos;t she, Uncle
                        Wesley?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;On your life, she must!&quot; said Wesley. &quot;You put
                        your little wad in the bank all safe, and never mention <pb id="VAA2373-100"
                            n="91"/> it to a living soul. It don&apos;t seem right, but your
                        case is peculiar. Every word you say is a true word. Each year you will get
                        less from the swamp, and things every-where will be scarcer. If you ever get
                        a few dollars ahead, that can start your college fund. You know you are
                        going to college, Elnora!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I am,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I settled that as
                        soon as I knew what a college was. I will put all my money in the bank,
                        except what I owe you. I&apos;ll pay that now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If your arrows are heavy,&quot; said Wesley,
                        &quot;I&apos;ll drive on to Onabasha with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But they are not. Half of them were nicked, and this little box
                        held all the good ones. It&apos;s so surprising how many are spoiled
                        when you wash them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What does he pay?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ten cents for any common perfect one, fifty for revolvers, a dollar
                        for obsidian, and whatever is right for enormous big ones.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that sounds fair,&quot; said Sinton.
                        &quot;It&apos;s more than I would want to give for the things. You
                        can come down Saturday and wash up the stuff at our house, and I&apos;ll
                        take it in when we go marketing in the afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora jumped from the carriage. She soon found that with her books, her
                        lunch box, and the points she had a heavy load. She was almost to the bridge
                        crossing the culvert when she heard the distressed screams of a child.
                        Across an orchard of the suburbs came a small <pb id="VAA2373-101" n="92"/>
                        boy, after him a big dog, urged by a man in the background.
                        Elnora&apos;s heart was with the small flying figure in any event
                        whatever. She dropped her load on the bridge, and with practised hand caught
                        up a stone and flung it at the dog. The beast curled double with a howl. The
                        boy reached the fence, and Elnora was there to help him over. As he touched
                        the top she swung him to the ground, but he clung to her, clasping her
                        tightly, sobbing and shivering with fear. Elnora carried him to the bridge,
                        and sat with him in her arms. For a time his replies to her questions were
                        indistinct, but at last he became quieter and she could understand.</p>
                    <p>He was a mite of a boy, nothing but skin-covered bones, his burned, freckled
                        face in a mortar of tears and dust, his clothing unspeakably dirty, one
                        great toe in a festering mass from a broken nail, and sores all over the
                        visible portions of the small body.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You won&apos;t let the mean old thing make his dog get
                        me!&quot; he wailed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed no,&quot; said Elnora, hugging him closely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t set a dog on a boy for just taking a few old
                        apples when you fed &apos;em to pigs with a shovel every day, would
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I would not,&quot; said Elnora hotly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d give a boy all the apples he wanted, if he
                        hadn&apos;t any breakfast, and was so hungry he was all twisty inside,
                        wouldn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I would,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-102" n="93"/>
                    <p>&quot;If you had anything to eat you would give me something right now,
                        wouldn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;There&apos;s nothing but
                        just stones in the package. But my dinner is in that case. I&apos;ll
                        gladly divide.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She opened the box. The famished child gave a little cry and reached both
                        hands. Elnora caught them back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you have any supper?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Any dinner yesterday?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;An apple and some grapes I stole.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whose boy are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Old Tom Billings&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t your father get you something to eat?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He does most days, but he&apos;s drunk now.&quot;
                        &quot;Hush, you must not!&quot; said Elnora. &quot;He&apos;s
                        your father!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s spent all the money to get drunk, too,&quot; said
                        the boy, &quot;and Jimmy and Belle are both crying for breakfast.
                        &quot;I&apos;d a got out all right with an apple for myself, but I
                        tried to get some for them, and the dog got too close. Say, you can just
                        throw, can&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted Elnora. She poured half the milk into the
                        cup. &quot; Drink this,&quot; she said, holding it to him.</p>
                    <p>The boy gulped the milk and swore joyously, gripping the cup with shaking
                        fingers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hush!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;That&apos;s
                        dreadful!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s dreadful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To say such awful words.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-103" n="94"/>
                    <p>&quot;Huh! pa says worser &apos;an that every breath he
                        draws.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora stared into the quaint little face, and saw that the child was older
                        than she had thought. He might have been forty by his hard, unchildish
                        expression.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want to be like your father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I want to be like you. Couldn&apos;t a angel be prettier
                        &apos;an you. Can I have more milk?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora emptied the flask. The boy drained the cup. He drew a breath of
                        satisfaction as he gazed into her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t go off and leave your little boy, would
                        you?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did someone go away and leave you?&quot; questioned Elnora in
                        return.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, my mother went off and left me, and left Jimmy and Belle,
                        too,&quot; said the boy. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t leave your
                        little boy, would you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The boy looked eagerly at the box. Elnora lifted a sandwich and uncovered the
                        fried chicken. The boy gasped with delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, I could eat the stuff in the glass, and the other box and
                        carry the bread and the chicken to Jimmy and Belle,&quot; he offered.</p>
                    <p>Elnora silently uncovered the custard with preserved cherries on top and
                        handed it and the spoon to the child. Never did food disappear faster. The
                        salad went next, and a sandwich and half a chicken breast followed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I better leave the rest for Jimmy and Belle,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;they&apos;re &apos;ist fightin&quot; hungry.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-104" n="95"/>
                    <p>Elnora gave him the remainder of the carefully prepared lunch. The boy
                        clutched it and ran with a sidewise hop like a wild thing.</p>
                    <p>Elnora covered the dishes and cup, polished the spoon, replaced it, and
                        closed the beautiful case. She caught her breath in a tremulous laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If Aunt Margaret knew that, she&apos;d never forgive
                        me,&quot; she said. &quot;It seems as if secrecy is literally forced
                        upon me, and I hate it. What will I do for lunch? I&apos;ll have to go
                        sell my arrows and keep enough money for a restaurant sandwich.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So she walked hurriedly into town, sold her points at a good price, deposited
                        her funds, and went away with a neat little bank book and the note from the
                        Limberlost carefully folded inside. Elnora passed down the great hall that
                        morning, and no one paid the slightest attention to her. The truth was she
                        looked so like everyone else that she was perfectly inconspicuous. But in
                        the coat room there were members of her class. Surely no one intended it,
                        but the whisper was too loud.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at the girl from the Limberlost in the clothes that woman gave
                        her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora turned on them. &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; she said
                        unsteadily, &quot;I couldn&apos;t help hearing that! No one gave me
                        these clothes. I paid for them myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Some one muttered, &quot;Pardon me,&quot; but incredulous faces
                        greeted her.</p>
                    <p>Elnora felt driven. &quot;Aunt Margaret selected them, and she meant to
                        give them to me,&quot; she explained, &quot;but I <pb
                            id="VAA2373-105" n="96"/> wouldn&apos;t take them. I paid for them
                        myself.&quot; There was a dead silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you believe me?&quot; panted Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really, it is none of our affair,&quot; said another girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, let&apos;s go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora stepped before the girl who had spoken. &quot;You have made this
                        your affair,&quot; she said, &quot;because you told a thing which
                        was not true. No one gave me what I am wearing. I paid for my clothes myself
                        with money I earned selling moths to the Bird Woman. I just came from the
                        bank where I deposited what I did not use. Here is my credit.&quot;
                        Elnora drew out and offered the little red book. &quot;Surely you will
                        believe that,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, of course,&quot; said the girl who first had spoken.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We met such a lovely woman in Brownlee&apos;s store, and she
                        said she wanted our help to buy some things for a girl, and that&apos;s
                        how we came to know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dear Aunt Margaret,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;it was like
                        her to ask you. Isn&apos;t she splendid?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is indeed,&quot; chorused the girls. Elnora set down her
                        lunch box and books, unpinned her hat, hanging it beside the others, and
                        taking up the books she reached to set the box in its place and dropped it.
                        With a little cry she snatched at it and caught the strap on top. That
                        pulled from the fastening, the cover unrolled, the box fell away as far as
                        it could, two porcelain lids rattled on the floor, and the one sandwich
                        rolled like a cartwheel across the room. Elnora lifted a ghastly face. For
                        once no one laughed. She stood an instant staring.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-106" n="97"/>
                    <p>&quot;It seems to be my luck to be crucified at every point of the
                        compass,&quot; she said at last. &quot;First two days you thought I
                        was a pauper, now you will think I&apos;m a fraud. All of you will
                        believe I bought an expensive box, and then was too poor to put anything but
                        a restaurant sandwich in it. You must stop till I prove to you that
                        I&apos;m not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora gathered up the lids, and kicked the sandwich into a corner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had milk in that bottle, see! And custard in the cup. There was
                        salad in the little box, fried chicken in the large one, and nut sandwiches
                        in the tray. You can see the crumbs of all of them. A man set a dog on a
                        child who was so starved he was stealing apples. I talked with him, and I
                        thought I could bear hunger better, he was such a little boy, so I gave him
                        my lunch, and got the sandwich at the restaurant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora held out the box. The girls were laughing by that time. &quot;You
                        goose,&quot; said one, &quot;why didn&apos;t you give him the
                        money, and save your lunch?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was such a little fellow, and he really was hungry,&quot;
                        said Elnora. &quot;I often go without anything to eat at noon in the
                        fields and woods, and never think of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She closed the box and set it beside the lunches of other country pupils.
                        While her back was turned, into the room came the girl of her encounter on
                        the first day, walked to the rack, and with an exclamation of approval took
                        down Elnora&apos;s hat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just the thing I have been wanting!&quot; she said. &quot;I
                            <pb id="VAA2373-107" n="98"/> never saw such beautiful quills in all my
                        life. They match my new broadcloth to perfection. I&apos;ve got to have
                        that kind of quills for my hat. I never saw the like! Whose is it, and where
                        did it come from?&quot;</p>
                    <p>No one said a word, for Elnora&apos;s question, the reply, and her
                        answer, had gone the rounds of the high school. Everyone knew that the
                        Limberlost girl had come out ahead and Sadie Reed had not felt amiable, when
                        the little flourish had been added to Elnora&apos;s name in the algebra
                        class. Elnora&apos;s swift glance was pathetic, but no one helped her.
                        Sadie Reed glanced from the hat to the faces around her and wondered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, this is the Freshman section, whose hat is it?&quot; she
                        asked again, this time impatiently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the tassel of the cornstock,&quot; said Elnora
                        with a forced laugh.</p>
                    <p>The response was genuine. Everyone shouted. Sadie Reed blushed, but she
                        laughed also.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s beautiful,&quot; she
                        said,&quot;especially the quills. They are exactly what I want. I know I
                        don&apos;t deserve any kindness from you, but I do wish you would tell
                        me at whose store you got those quills.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gladly!&quot; said Elnora. &quot;You can&apos;t get
                        quills like those at a store. They are from a living bird. Phoebe Simms
                        gathers them in her orchard as her peacocks shed them. They are wing quills
                        from the males.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then there was a perfect silence. How was Elnora to know that not a girl
                        there would have told that?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t a doubt but I can get you some,&quot; she
                            <pb id="VAA2373-108" n="99"/> offered. &quot;She gave Aunt Margaret
                        a great bunch, and those are part of them. I am quite sure she has more, and
                        would spare some.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sadie Reed laughed shortly. &quot;You needn&apos;t trouble,&quot;
                        she said, &quot;I was fooled. I thought they were expensive quills. I
                        wanted them for a twenty-dollar velvet toque to match my new suit. If they
                        are picked off the ground, really, I couldn&apos;t use them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only in spots!&quot; said Elnora. &quot;They don&apos;t
                        just cover the earth. Phoebe Simms&apos;s peacocks are the only ones
                        within miles of Onabasha, and they moult but once a year. If your hat only
                        cost twenty dollars, it&apos;s hardly good enough for those quills. You
                        see, the Almighty made and coloured those Himself; and He puts the same kind
                        on Phoebe Simms&apos;s peacocks, that He put on the head of the family
                        in the forests of Ceylon, away back in the beginning. Any old manufactured
                        quill from New York or Chicago will do for your little twenty-dollar hat.
                        You ought to have something infinitely better than that to be worthy of
                        quills that are made by the Creator.&quot;</p>
                    <p>How those girls did laugh! One of them walked by Elnora to the auditorium,
                        sat with her during exercises, and tried to talk whenever she dared, to keep
                        Elnora from seeing the curious and admiring looks bent upon her. For the
                        brown-eyed boy whistled, and there was pantomime of all sorts going on
                        behind Elnora&apos;s back that day. Happy with her books, no one knew
                        how much she saw, and from her absorption in her studies <pb
                            id="VAA2373-109" n="100"/> it was evident she cared too little to
                        notice. It soon developed that to be inconspicuous and to work was all
                        Elnora craved.</p>
                    <p>After school she went again to the home of the Bird Woman, and together they
                        visited the swamp and took away more specimens. This time Elnora asked the
                        Bird Woman to keep the money until noon of the next day, when she would call
                        for it and have it added to her bank account. She slowly walked home, for
                        the visit to the swamp had brought back full force the experience of the
                        morning. Again and again she examined the crude little note, for she did not
                        know what it meant, yet it bred vague fear. The only thing on earth of which
                        Elnora knew herself afraid was her mother; when with wild eyes and ears deaf
                        to childish pleading, she sometimes lost control of herself in the night and
                        visited the pool where her husband had sunk before her, calling his name in
                        unearthly tones and begging of the swamp to give back its dead.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was Wesley Sinton who really wrestled with the problem
                        as he drove about his business. He did not have to ask himself what it
                        meant; he knew. The old Corson gang was still holding together. Elder
                        members who had escaped the law had been joined by a younger brother of
                        Jack&apos;s, and they met in the thickest of the few remaining fast
                        places of the swamp to drink, gamble, and loaf. Then, suddenly, there would
                        be a robbery in some country house where a farmer that day had sold his
                        wheat or corn and not paid a visit to the bank; or in some neighbouring
                        village.</p>
                    <p>The home of Mrs. Comstock and Elnora adjoined the swamp. Sinton&apos;s
                        land lay next, and not another residence or man easy to reach in case of
                        trouble. Whoever wrote that note had some human kindness in his breast, but
                        the fact stood revealed that he feared his strength if Elnora was delivered
                        into his hands. Where had he been the previous night when he heard that
                        prayer? Was that the first time he had been in such proximity? Sinton drove
                        fast, for he wished to reach the swamp <pb id="VAA2373-111" n="102"/> before
                        Elnora and the Bird Woman would go there for more moths.</p>
                    <p>At almost four he came to the case, and dropping on his knees studied the
                        ground, every sense alert. He found two or three little heel prints. Those
                        were made by Elnor or the Bird Woman. What Sinton wanted to learn was
                        whether all the rest were the footprints of one man. It was easily seen,
                        they were not. There were deep, even tracks made by fairly new shoes, and
                        others where a well-worn heel cut deeper on the inside of the print than at
                        the outer edge. Undoubtedly some of Corson&apos;s old gang were watching
                        the case, and the visits of the women to it. There was no danger that anyone
                        would attack the Bird Woman. She never went to the swamp at night, and on
                        her trips in the daytime, every one knew that she carried a revolver,
                        understood how to use it, and pursued her work in a fearless manner.</p>
                    <p>Elnora, prowling around the swamp and lured into the interior by the flight
                        of moths and butterflies; Elnora, without father, money, or friends save
                        himself, to defend herElnora was a different proposition. For the thing to
                        happen just when the Limberlost was bringing light, hope, and the very
                        desire of her heart to the girl, it was too bad.</p>
                    <p>Sinton was afraid for her, yet he did not want to add the burden of fear to
                        Katharine Comstock&apos;s trouble, or to disturb the joy of Elnora in
                        her work. He stopped at the cabin and slowly went up the walk. Mrs. Comstock
                            <pb id="VAA2373-112" n="103"/> was sitting on the front step with some
                        sewing. The work looked to Sinton as if she might be engaged in putting a
                        tuck in a petticoat. He thought of how Margaret had shortened
                        Elnora&apos;s dress to the accepted length for girls of her age, and
                        made a mental note of Mrs. Comstock&apos;s occupation.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock dropped her work on her lap, laid her hands on it and looked
                        into his face with a sneer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t let any grass grow under your feet,&quot;
                        she said.</p>
                    <p>Sinton saw her white, drawn face and comprehended.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I went to pay a debt and see about this opening of the ditch,
                        Kate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You said you were going to prosecute me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good gracious, Kate!&quot; cried Sinton. &quot;Is that what
                        you have been thinking all day? I told you before I left yesterday that I
                        would not need do that. And I won&apos;t! We can&apos;t afford to
                        quarrel over Elnora. She&apos;s all we&apos;ve got. Now that she has
                        proved that if you don&apos;t do just what I think you ought by way of
                        clothes and schooling, she can take care of herself, I put that out of my
                        head. What I came to see you about is a kind of scare I&apos;ve had
                        to-day. I want to ask you if you ever see anything about the swamp that
                        makes you think the old Corson gang is still alive?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t say that I do,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;There&apos;s kind of dancing lights there sometimes, but I
                        supposed it was just people passing along the road with lanterns. Folks
                        hereabout are none too fond of the swamp. I <pb id="VAA2373-113" n="104"/>
                        hate it like death. I&apos;ve never stayed here a night in my life
                        without Robert&apos;s revolver, clean and loaded, under my pillow, and
                        the shotgun, same condition, by the bed. I can&apos;t say that
                        I&apos;m afraid here at home. I&apos;m not. I can take care of
                        myself. But none of the swamp for me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m glad you are not afraid, Kate, because I got to
                        tell you something. Elnora stopped at the case this morning, and somebody
                        had been into it in the night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Broke the lock?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Used a duplicate key. To-day I heard there was a man here last
                        night. I want to nose around a little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton went to the east end of the cabin and looked up at the window. There
                        was no way anyone could have reached it without a ladder, for the logs were
                        hewed and mortar filled the cracks even. Then he went to the west end, the
                        willow faced him as he turned the corner. He examined the trunk carefully.
                        There was no mistake about small particles of black swamp muck adhering to
                        the sides of the tree. He reached the low branches and climbed the willow.
                        There was earth on the large limb crossing Elnora&apos;s window. He
                        stood on it, holding the branch as had been done the night before, and
                        looked into the room. He could see very little, but he knew that if it had
                        been dark outside and sufficiently light for Elnora to study inside he could
                        have seen vividly. He brought his face close to the netting, and he could
                        see the bed with its head to the east, at its <pb id="VAA2373-114" n="105"/>
                        foot the table with the candles and the chair before it, and then he knew
                        where the man had been who had heard Elnora&apos;s prayer.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock had followed around the corner and stood watching him.
                        &quot;Do you think some slinking hulk was up there peekin&apos; in
                        at Elnora?&quot; she demanded indignantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is muck on the trunk, and plenty on the limb,&quot; said
                        Sinton. &quot;Hadn&apos;t you better get a saw and let me take this
                        branch off?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I hadn&apos;t, &quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;First place, Elnora&apos;s climbed from that window on that
                        limb all her life, and it&apos;s hers. Second place, no one gets ahead
                        of me after I&apos;ve had warning. Any crow that perches on that roost
                        again, will get its feathers somewhat scattered. Look along the fence,
                        there, and see if you can find where he came in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The place was easy to find as was a trail leading for some distance west of
                        the cabin.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You just go home, and don&apos;t fret yourself,&quot; said
                        Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I &apos;ll take care of this. If you should
                        hear the dinner bell at any time in the night you come down. But I
                        wouldn&apos;t say anything to Elnora. She best keep her mind on her
                        studies, if she&apos;s going to school.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When the work was finished that night Elnora took her books and went to her
                        room to prepare some lessons, but every few minutes she looked toward the
                        swamp to see if there were lights near the case. Mrs. Comstock raked
                        together the coals in the cooking stove, got out <pb id="VAA2373-115"
                            n="106"/> the lunch box, and sitting down she studied it grimly. At last
                        she arose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wonder how it would do to show Mag Sinton a frill or two,&quot;
                        she murmured.</p>
                    <p>She went to her room, knelt by a big black-walnut chest and hunted through
                        its contents until she found an old-fashioned cook book. She tended the fire
                        as she read and presently was in action. She first sawed an end from a
                        fragrant, juicy, sugar-cured ham and put it to cook. Then she set a couple
                        of eggs boiling, and after long hesitation began creaming butter and sugar
                        in a crock. An hour later the odour of the ham, mingled with some of the
                        richest spices of &quot;happy Araby,&quot; in a combination that
                        could mean nothing save spice cake, crept up to Elnora so strongly that she
                        lifted her head and sniffed amazedly. She would have given all her precious
                        money to go down and throw her arms around her mother&apos;s neck, but
                        she did not dare move, even to open the door for a better smell.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock was up early, and without a word handed Elnora the case as she
                        left the next morning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, mother,&quot; said Elnora, and went on her way.</p>
                    <p>She walked down the road looking straight ahead until she came to the corner,
                        where she usually entered the swamp. She paused, glanced that way and
                        smiled. Then she turned and looked back. There was no one coming in any
                        direction. She kept to the road until well around the corner, then she
                        stopped and <pb id="VAA2373-116" n="107"/> sat on a grassy spot, laid her
                        books beside her and opened the lunch box. Last night&apos;s odours had
                        in a measure prepared her for what she would see, but not quite. She
                        scarcely could believe her senses. Half the bread compartment was filled
                        with dainty sandwiches of bread and butter sprinkled with the yolk of egg
                        and the rest with three large slices of the most fragrant spice cake
                        imaginable. The meat dish contained shaved cold ham, of which she knew the
                        quality, the salad was tomatoes and celery, and the cup held preserved pear,
                        clear as amber. There was milk in the bottle, two tissue-wrapped cucumber
                        pickles in the folding drinking-cup, and a fresh napkin in the ring. No
                        lunch was ever daintier or more palatable; of that Elnora was perfectly
                        sure. And her mother had prepared it for her!</p>
                    <p>She glanced around her and then to her old refuge, the sky. &quot;She
                        does love me!&quot; cried the happy girl. &quot;Sure as you
                        &apos;re born she loves me; she just hasn&apos;t found it out
                        yet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She touched the papers daintily, and smiled at the box as if it were a living
                        thing. As she began closing it a breath of air swept by, lifting the
                        covering of the cake. It was like an invitation, and breakfast was several
                        hours away. Elnora picked up a piece and ate it. That cake tasted even
                        better than it looked. Then she tried a sandwich. How did her mother come to
                        think of making them that way. They never had any at home. She slipped out
                        the fork, sampled the salad, and one-quarter of pear. Then she closed the
                        box <pb id="VAA2373-117" n="108"/> and started down the road nibbling one of
                        the pickles and trying to decide exactly how happy she was, but just then
                        she could find no standard high enough for a measure.</p>
                    <p>She was to go to the Bird Woman&apos;s after school for the last load
                        from the case. Saturday she would take the arrow points and specimens to the
                        bank. That would exhaust her present supplies and give her enough money
                        ahead to pay for books, tuition, and clothes for at least two years. She
                        would work early and late gathering nuts. In October she would sell all the
                        ferns she could find. She must collect specimens of all tree leaves before
                        they fell, gather nests and cocoons later, and keep her eyes wide open for
                        anything the grades could use. She would see the superintendent that night
                        about selling specimens to the ward buildings. She must be ahead of anyone
                        else if she wanted to furnish these things. So she approached the bridge.</p>
                    <p>That it was occupied could be seen from a distance. As she came up she found
                        the small boy of yesterday awaiting her with a confident smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We brought you something!&quot; he announced without greeting.
                        &quot;This is Jimmy and Belleand we brought you a present.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He offered a parcel wrapped in brown paper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, how lovely of you!&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I supposed
                        you had forgotten me when you ran away so fast yesterday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Naw, I didn&apos;t forget you,&quot; said the boy. I
                        wouldn&apos;t <pb id="VAA2373-118" n="109"/> forget you, not ever! Why,
                        I was ist a-hurrying to take them things to Jimmy and Belle. My, they was
                        glad!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora glanced at the children. They sat on the edge of the bridge, obviously
                        clad in a garment each, very dirty and unkept, a little boy and a girl of
                        about seven and nine. Elnora&apos;s heart began to ache.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say,&quot; said the boy. &quot;Ain&apos;t you going to
                        look what we have gave you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought it wasn&apos;t polite to look before
                        people,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;Of course, I will, if you would
                        like to have me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora opened the package. She had been presented with a quarter of a stale
                        loaf of baker&apos;s bread, and a big piece of ancient
                        bologna.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But don&apos;t you want this yourselves?&quot; she asked in
                        surprise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gosh, no! I mean ist plain no,&quot; said the boy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We always have it. We got stacks this morning. Pa&apos;s come
                        out of it now, and he&apos;s so sorry he got more &apos;an ever we
                        can cat. Have you had any before?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;I never did!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The boy&apos;s eyes brightened and the girl moved restlessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We thought maybe you hadn&apos;t,&quot; said the boy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;First you ever have, you like it real well; but when you
                        don&apos;t have anything else for a long time, years an&apos; years,
                        you git so tired.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He hitched at the string which held his trousers and eyed Elnora
                        speculatively.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-119" n="110"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t s&apos;pose you&apos;d trade what you got
                        in that box for ist old bread and bologna now, would you? Mebby you
                        &apos;d like it! And I know, I ist know, what you got would taste like
                        heaven to Jimmy and Belle. They never had nothing like that! Not even Belle,
                        and she&apos;s most ten! No, sir-ee, they never tasted things like you
                        got!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was in Elnora&apos;s heart to be thankful that she had got even a
                        taste in time, as she knelt on the bridge opened the box and divided her
                        lunch into three equal parts, the smaller boy getting most of the milk. Then
                        she told them it was school time and she must go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you put your bread and bologna in the nice
                        box?&quot; asked the boy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I didn&apos;t
                        think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When the box was arranged to the children&apos;s satisfaction all of them
                        accompanied Elnora to the corner where she turned toward the high school.
                        Elnora and Billy led the way, Jimmy and Belle followed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;I would like you much
                        better if you were cleaner. Surely, you have water! Can&apos;t you
                        children get some soap and wash yourselves? Gentlemen are never dirty. You
                        want to be a gentleman, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is being clean all you have to do to be a gentleman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;You must not say bad words,
                        and you must be kind and polite to your sister.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Must Belle be kind and polite to me, else she ain&apos;t a
                        lady?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-120" n="111"/>
                    <p>&quot;Then Belle&apos;s no lady!&quot; said Billy succinctly.</p>
                    <p>Elnora could say nothing more just then, and she bade them good-bye and
                        started them home.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The poor little souls!&quot; she mused. &quot;I think the
                        Almighty put them in my way to show me real trouble. I won&apos;t be
                        likely to spend much time pitying myself while I can see them.&quot; She
                        glanced at the lunch box. &quot;What on earth do I carry this for? I
                        never had anything that was so strictly ornamental! One sure thing! I
                        can&apos;t take this stuff to the high school. You never seem to know
                        just what is going to happen to you while you are there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As if to provide a way out of her difficulty a big dog arose from a lawn, and
                        came toward the gate wagging his tail. &quot;If those children ate the
                        stuff, it can&apos;t possibly kill him!&quot; thought Elnora, so she
                        offered the bologna. The dog accepted it graciously, and being a pedigreed
                        beast he trotted around to a side porch and laid the bologna before his
                        mistress. The woman snatched it, screaming, &quot;Come, quick! Someone
                        is trying to poison Pedro!&quot; Her daughter came running from the
                        house. &quot;Go see who is on the street. Hurry!&quot; cried the
                        excited mother.</p>
                    <p>Ellen Brownlee ran and looked. Elnora was a half block away, and no one
                        nearer. Ellen called loudly, and Elnora stopped. Ellen came running toward
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see anyone give our dog something?&quot; she cried as
                        she approached.</p>
                    <p>Elnora saw no escape.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-121" n="112"/>
                    <p>&quot;I gave it a piece of bologna myself,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;It was fit to eat. It wouldn&apos;t hurt the dog.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ellen stood and looked at her. &quot;Of course, I didn&apos;t know it
                        was your dog,&quot; explained Elnora. &quot;I just had something I
                        wanted to throw to some dog, and that one looked big enough to manage
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ellen had arrived at her conclusions. &quot;Pass over that lunch
                        box,&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will not!&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I will have you arrested for trying to poison our
                        dog,&quot; laughed the girl as she took the box.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One chunk of stale bread, one half mile of antique bologna
                        contributed for dog feed, the remains of cake, salad and preserves in an
                        otherwise empty lunch box. One ham sandwich yesterday. I think it&apos;s
                        lovely you have the box. Who got your lunch?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Same,&quot; confessed Elnora, &quot;but there were three of
                        them to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait, until I run back and tell mother about the dog, and get my
                        books.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora waited, and that morning she walked down the hall and into the
                        auditorium beside one of the very nicest girls in Onabasha, and it was the
                        fourth day. But the surprise came at noon when Ellen insisted upon Elnora
                        lunching at the Brownlee home, and convulsed her parents and family, and
                        overwhelmed Elnora by a greatly magnified, but moderately accurate history
                        of her lunch box.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gee! but it&apos;s a box, daddy!&quot; cried the laughing
                            <pb id="VAA2373-122" n="113"/> girl. &quot;It&apos;s carved
                        leather and fastens with a strap that&apos;s got her name on it. Inside
                        are trays for things all complete, and it bears evidence of having enclosed
                        delicious food, but Elnora never gets any. She&apos;s carried it two
                        days now, and both times it has been empty before she reached school.
                        Isn&apos;t that killing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is, Ellen, in more ways than one. No girl is going to cat
                        breakfast at six o&apos;clock, walk three miles, and do good work with
                        no lunch. You can&apos;t tell me anything about that box. I sold it last
                        Monday night to Wesley Sinton, one of my good country customers. He told me
                        it was a present for a girl who was worthy of it, and I see he was
                        right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s so good to me,&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;Sometimes I look at him and wonder if a neighbour can be so kind
                        to one, what a real father would be like. I envy a girl with a father
                        unspeakably.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have cause,&quot; said Ellen Brownlee. &quot;A father
                        is the very nicest thing in the whole round world, except a mother, who is
                        just as nice.&quot; The girl, starting to pay tribute to her father, saw
                        that she must include her mother, and said the thing before she remembered
                        what Mrs. Sinton had told the girls in the store. She stopped in dismay.
                        Elnora&apos;s face paled a trifle, but she smiled bravely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I&apos;m fortunate in having a mother,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brownlee lingered at the table after the girls had excused themselves and
                        returned to school.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s a girl Ellen can&apos;t see too much of, in my
                            <pb id="VAA2373-123" n="114"/> opinion,&quot; he said. &quot;She
                        is every inch a lady, and not a foolish notion or action about her. I
                        can&apos;t understand just what combination of circumstances produced
                        her in this day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It has been an unusual case of repression, for one thing. She waits
                        on her elders and thinks before she speaks,&quot; said Mrs. Brownlee.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s mighty pretty. She looks so sound and wholesome, and
                        she&apos;s neatly dressed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ellen says she was a fright the first two days. Long brown calico
                        dress almost touching the floor, and big, lumbering shoes. Those Sinton
                        people bought her clothes. Ellen was in the store, and the woman stopped her
                        crowd and asked them about their dresses. She said the girl was not poor,
                        but her mother was selfish and didn&apos;t care for her. But Elnora
                        showed a bank-book the next day, and declared that she paid for the things
                        herself, so the Sinton people must just have selected them. There&apos;s
                        something peculiar about it, but nothing wrong I am sure. I&apos;ll
                        encourage Ellen to ask her again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I should say so, especially if she is going to keep on giving
                        away her lunch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She lunched with the Bird Woman one day this week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She did!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, she lives out by the Limberlost. You know the Bird Woman works
                        there a great deal, and probably knows her that way. I think the girl
                        gathers specimens <pb id="VAA2373-124" n="115"/> for her. Ellen says she
                        knows more than the teachers about any nature question that comes up, and
                        she is going to lead all of them in mathematics, and make them work in any
                        branch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Elnora entered the coat room after having had luncheon with Ellen
                        Brownlce there was such a difference in the atmosphere that she could feel
                        it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am almost sorry I have these clothes,&quot; she said to
                        Ellen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In the name of sense, why?&quot; cried the astonished girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everyone is so nice to me in them, it just sets me to wondering if
                        in time I could have made them be equally friendly in the others.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ellen looked at her introspectively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir, I believe you could,&quot; she announced at last.
                        &quot;But it would have taken time and heartache, and your mind would
                        have been less free to work on your studies. No one is happy without
                        friends, and I just simply can&apos;t study when I am unhappy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That night the Bird Woman made the last trip to the swamp. Every specimen she
                        possibly could use had been purchased at a fair price, and three additions
                        had been made to the bank-book, carrying the total a little past two hundred
                        dollars. There remained the Indian relics to sell on Saturday, and Elnora
                        had secured the order to furnish material for nature work for the grades.
                        Life suddenly grew very full. There was the most excitingly interesting work
                        for every hour, and that work was to pay high-school expenses and <pb
                            id="VAA2373-125" n="116"/> start the college fund. There was just one
                        little rift in her joy. All of it would have been so much better if she
                        could have told her mother, and given the money into her keeping. But the
                        struggle to get a start had been so terrible, Elnora was afraid to take the
                        risk.</p>
                    <p>When she reached home, she only told her mother that the last of the things
                        had been sold that evening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock, &quot;that we will get
                        Wesley to move that box over here back of the garden for you. There you are
                        apt to get tolled farther into the swamp than you intend to go, and you
                        might mire or something. There ought to be just the same things in our
                        woods, and along our swampy places, as there are in the Limberlost.
                        Can&apos;t you hunt your stuff here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can try,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I don&apos;t know
                        what I can find until I do. Our woods are undisturbed, and there is a
                        possibility they might be even better hunting than the swamp. But I
                        wouldn&apos;t have Freckles&apos;s case moved for the world. He
                        might come back some day, and not like it. I&apos;ve tried to keep his
                        room the best I could, and taking out the box would make a great hole in one
                        side of it. Store boxes don&apos;t cost much. I will have Uncle Wesley
                        buy me one, and set it up wherever hunting looks the best, early in the
                        spring. I would feel safer at home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall we do the work or have supper first?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s do the work,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I
                        can&apos;t say that I &apos;m hungry now. Don&apos;t seem as if
                        I ever could <pb id="VAA2373-126" n="117"/> be hungry again with such a
                        lunch. I am quite sure no one carried more delicious things to eat than
                        I.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock was pleased. &quot;I put in a pretty good hunk of
                        cake,&quot; she said. &quot;Did you divide it with anyone?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, yes, I did,&quot; admitted Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Things were getting uncomfortable. &quot;I ate the biggest piece
                        myself,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;and gave the rest to a couple of
                        boys named Jimmy and Billy and a girl named Belle. They said it was very
                        best cake they ever tasted in all their lives.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock sat straight. &quot;I used to be a master hand at spice
                        cake,&quot; she boasted. &quot;But I&apos;m a little out of
                        practice. I must get to work again. With the very weeds growing higher than
                        our heads, we should get plenty of good stuff to eat off this land, if we
                        can&apos;t afford anything else but taxes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora laughed and hurried up stairs to change her dress.</p>
                    <p>Margaret Sinton came that night bringing a beautiful blue one in its stead,
                        and &quot;carried away the other to launder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mean to say those dresses are to be washed every two
                        days?&quot; questioned Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They have to be, to look fresh,&quot; replied Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We want our girl sweet as a rose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, of all things!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Every
                        two days! Any girl who can&apos;t keep a dress clean longer <pb
                            id="VAA2373-127" n="118"/> than that is a dirty girl. You&apos;ll
                        wear the goods out and fade the colours with so much washing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We &apos;ll have a clean girl, anyway.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if you like the job you can have it,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;I don&apos;t mind the washing, but I&apos;m so
                        inconvenient with an iron.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora sat late that night working hard over her lessons. The next morning
                        she put on her blue dress and ribbon and in those she was a picture. Mrs.
                        Comstock caught her breath with a queer stirring around her heart, and
                        looked twice to be sure of what she saw. As Elnora gathered her books her
                        mother silently gave her the lunch box.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Feels heavy,&quot; said Elnora gaily. &quot;And smelly!
                        Like as not I&apos;ll be called upon to divide again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you divide!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Eating is
                        the one thing we don&apos;t have to economize on, Elnora. Spite of all I
                        can do food goes to waste in this soil every day. If you can give some of
                        those city children a taste of the real thing, why, don&apos;t be
                        selfish.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora went down the road thinking of the city children with whom she
                        probably would divide. Of course, the bridge would be occupied again. So she
                        stopped and opened the box. Undoubtedly Mrs. Comstock was showing Margaret
                        Sinton the &quot;frills.&quot; The cake was still fresh, and there
                        were four slices. The sandwiches had to be tasted twice before Elnora
                        discovered that beechnuts had been used in a peanut recipe, and they were a
                        great improvement. There were preserved <pb id="VAA2373-128" n="119"/>
                        strawberries in the cup, potato salad with mint and cucumber in the dish,
                        and a beautifully browned squab from the stable loft.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to be selfish,&quot; murmured Elnora,
                        &quot;but it just seems as if I can&apos;t give away this lunch. If
                        mother did not put love into it, she&apos;s substituted something
                        that&apos;s likely to fool me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She almost felt her steps lagging as she approached the bridge. A very hungry
                        dog had been added to the trio of children. Elnora loved all dogs, and, as
                        usual, this one came to her in friendliness. The children said
                        &quot;Good morning!&quot; with alacrity, and another paper parcel
                        lay conspicuous.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How are you this morning?&quot; inquired Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right!&quot; cried the three, while the dog sniffed
                        ravenously at the lunch box, and beat a perfect tattoo with his tail.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did you like the bologna?&quot; questioned Billy eagerly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One of the girls took me to lunch at her home yesterday,&quot;
                        answered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>Dawn broke beautifully over Billy&apos;s streaked face. He caught the
                        package and thrust it toward Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then maybe you&apos;d like to try the bologna to-day!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The dog leaped in glad apprehension of something, and Belle scrambled to her
                        feet and took a step forward. The look of famished greed in her eyes was
                        more than Elnora could bear. It was not that she cared for the food so much.
                        Good things to eat had been in abundance <pb id="VAA2373-129" n="120"/> all
                        her life. She wanted with this lunch to try to absorb what she felt must be
                        an expression of some sort from her mother, and if it was not a
                        manifestation of love, she did not know what to think it. But it was her
                        mother who had said &quot;be generous.&quot; She knelt on the
                        bridge. &quot;Keep back the dog!&quot; she warned the elder boy.</p>
                    <p>She opened the box and divided the milk between Billy and the girl. She gave
                        each a piece of cake leaving one and a sandwich. Billy pressed forward
                        eagerly, bitter disappointment on his face, and the elder boy forgot his
                        charge.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, I thought they&apos;d be meat!&quot; lamented Billy.</p>
                    <p>Elnora gave way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is!&quot; she said gladly. &quot;There is a little
                        pigeon bird. I want just a teeny piece of the breast, for a sort of
                        keepsake, just one bite, and you can have the rest among you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora drew the knife from its holder and cut off the wishbone. Then she held
                        the bird toward the girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can divide it,&quot; she said. The dog made a bound and
                        seizing the squab sprang from the bridge and ran for life. The girl and boy
                        hurried after him. With awful eyes Billy stared and swore tempestuously.
                        Elnora caught him and clapped her hand over the little mouth. A delivery
                        wagon came tearing down the street, the horse running full speed, passed the
                        fleeing dog with the girl and boy in pursuit, and stopped at the bridge.
                        High school girls began to roll from all sides of it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A rescue! A rescue!&quot; they shouted.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-130" n="121"/>
                    <p>It was Ellen Brownlee and her crowd, and every girl of them carried a big
                        parcel. They took in the scene as they approached. The fleeing dog with
                        something in its mouth, the half-naked girl and boy chasing it told the
                        story. Those girls screamed with laughter as they watched the pursuit.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank goodness, I saved the wishbone!&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;As usual, I can prove that there was a bird.&quot; She turned
                        toward the box. Billy had improved the time. He had the last piece of cake
                        in one hand, and the last bite of salad disappeared in one great gulp. Then
                        the girls shouted again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s have a sample ourselves,&quot; suggested one.
                        She caught up the box and handed out the remaining sandwich. Another girl
                        divided it into bites each little over an inch square, and then she lifted
                        the cup lid and deposited a preserved strawberry on each bite.
                        &quot;One, two, three, altogether now!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>Billy let out a roar. &quot;You old mean things!&quot; he screamed.</p>
                    <p>In an instant he was down in the road and handfuls of dust began to fly among
                        them. The girls scattered before him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;Billy! I&apos;ll never
                        give you another bite as long as I live, if you throw dust on
                        anyone!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then Billy dropped the dust, bored both fists into his eyes, and fled sobbing
                        into Elnora&apos;s new blue skirt. She stooped to meet him and
                        consolation began. Those <pb id="VAA2373-131" n="122"/> girls laughed on.
                        They screamed and shouted until the little bridge shook.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To-morrow might as well be a clear day,&quot; said Ellen,
                        passing around and feeding the remaining berries to the girls as they could
                        compose themselves enough to take them. &quot;Billy, I admire your taste
                        more than your temper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora looked up. &quot;The little soul is nothing but skin and
                        bones,&quot; she said. &quot;I never was really hungry myself; were
                        any of you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I should say so,&quot; cried a plump, rosy girl.
                        &quot;I&apos;m famished right now. Let&apos;s have breakfast
                        immediate!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We got to refill this box first!&quot; said Ellen Brownlee.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s got the butter?&quot; A girl advanced with a
                        wooden tray.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Put it in the preserve cup, a little strawberry flavour
                        won&apos;t hurt it. Next!&quot; called Ellen.</p>
                    <p>A loaf of bread was produced and Ellen cut off a piece which filled the
                        sandwich box.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Next!&quot; A bottle of olives was unwrapped. The
                        grocer&apos;s boy who was waiting opened that, and Ellen filled the
                        salad dish.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Next!&quot;</p>
                    <p>A bag of macaroons was produced and the cake compartment filled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Next!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t suppose this will make quite as good dog feed as a
                        bird,&quot; laughed a girl holding open a bag of sliced ham while Ellen
                        filled the meat dish.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Next!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-132" n="123"/>
                    <p>A box of candy was handed her and she stuffed every corner of the lunch box
                        with chocolates and nougat. Then it was closed and formally presented to
                        Elnora. The girls each helped themselves to candy and olives, and gave Billy
                        the remainder of the food. Billy took one bite of ham, and approved. Belle
                        and Jimmy had given up chasing the dog and, angry and ashamed, stood waiting
                        a half block away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come back!&quot; screamed Billy. &quot;You great big
                        dunces, come back! They&apos;s a new kind of meat, and cake and
                        candy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The boy delayed, but the girl joined Billy. Ellen wiped her fingers, stepped
                        to the cement abutment and began reciting &quot;Horatio at the
                        Bridge!&quot; substituting Elnora wherever the hero appeared in the
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>Elnora gathered up the sacks, and gave them to Belle telling her to take the
                        food home, cut and spread the bread, set things on the table, and eat
                        nicely.</p>
                    <p>Then Elnora was hustled into the wagon with the girls, and driven on the run
                        to the high school. They sang a song beginning <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">&quot;Elnora please give me a sandwich.</l>
                                <l n="2">I &apos;m ashamed to ask for cake&quot;</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> as they went. Elnora did not know it, but that was her initiation. She
                        belonged to &quot;the crowd.&quot; She only knew that she was happy,
                        and vaguely wondered what her mother and Aunt Margaret would have said about
                        the proceedings.</p>

                    <p>S<hi rend="sc">ATURDAY</hi> morning Elnora helped her mother with the work.
                        When she had finished Mrs. Comstock told her to go to Sinton&apos;s and
                        wash her Indian relics, so that she would be ready to accompany Wesley to
                        town in the afternoon. Elnora hurried down the road and was soon at the
                        cistern with a tub busily washing arrow points, stone axes, tubes, pipes,
                        and skin-cleaning implements. There were not so many points as she had
                        supposed, and some she had thought the finest were chipped and broken, still
                        there was quite a large box of perfect pieces to carry to the city.</p>
                    <p>Then Elnora hurried home, dressed and was waiting when the carriage reached
                        the gate. She stopped at the bank with the box, and Sinton went to do his
                        marketing and a little shopping for his wife.</p>
                    <p>At the dry goods store Mr. Brownlee called to him, &quot;Hello,
                        Sinton!&quot; how do you like the fate of your lunch box?&quot; Then
                        he began to laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I always hate to see a man laughing alone,&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It looks so selfish! Tell me the fun, and let me help
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Brownlee wiped his eyes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-134" n="125"/>
                    <p>&quot;I supposed you knew, but I see she hasn&apos;t told.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then the three days&apos; history of the lunch box was repeated with
                        particulars which included the dog.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now laugh!&quot; concluded Brownlee.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Blest if I see anything funny!&quot; replied Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And if you had bought that box and furnished one of those lunches
                        yourself, you wouldn&apos;t either. I call such a work a shame!
                        I&apos;ll have it stopped.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Some one must see to that, all right. They are little leeches.
                        Their father earns enough to support them, but they have no mother, and they
                        run wild. I suppose they are crazy for cooked food. But it is funny, and
                        when you think it over you will see it, if you don&apos;t now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About where would a body find that father?&quot; inquired
                        Sinton grimly. Mr. Brownlee told him and he started, locating the house with
                        little difficulty. House was the proper word, for of home there was no sign.
                        Just a small empty house with three unkept little children racing through
                        and around it. The girl and the elder boy hung back, but dirty little Billy
                        greeted Sinton with, &quot;What you want here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see your father,&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, he&apos;s asleep,&quot; said Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot; asked Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In the house,&quot; answered Billy, &quot;and you
                        can&apos;t wake him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll try,&quot; said Wesley.</p>
                    <p>Billy led the way. &quot;There he is!&quot; he said. &quot;He is
                        drunk again.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-135" n="126"/>
                    <p>On a dirty mattress in a corner lay a sleeping man who appeared to be strong
                        and well.</p>
                    <p>Billy was right. You could not awake him. He had gone the limit, and a little
                        beyond. He was now facing eternity.</p>
                    <p>Sinton went out and closed the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your father is sick and needs help,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;You stay here, and I will send a man to see him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you just let him &apos;lone, he &apos;ll sleep it
                        off,&quot; volunteered Billy. &quot;He&apos;s that way all the
                        time, but he wakes up and gets us something to eat after awhile. Only
                        waitin&apos; twists you up inside pretty bad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The boy wore no air of complaint. He was merely stating facts.</p>
                    <p>Wesley Sinton looked hard at Billy. &quot;Are you twisted up inside
                        now?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>Billy laid a grimy hand on the region of his stomach and the filthy little
                        waist sank close to the backbone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bet yer life, boss,&quot; he said cheerfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long have you been twisted?&quot; asked Sinton.</p>
                    <p>Billy appealed to the others. &quot;When was it we had the stuff on the
                        bridge?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesterday morning,&quot; said the girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that all gone?&quot; asked Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She went and told us to take it home,&quot; said Billy
                        ruefully, &quot;and &apos;cause she said to, we took it. Pa had come
                        back, he was drinking some more, and he ate a lot of it&apos; most the
                        whole thing, and it made him sick as a dog, and he went and wasted all of
                        it. Then he <pb id="VAA2373-136" n="127"/> got drunk some more, and now
                        he&apos;s asleep again. We didn&apos;t get hardly none.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You children sit on the steps until the man comes,&quot; said
                        Sinton. &quot;I&apos;ll send you some things to eat with him.
                        What&apos;s your name, sonny?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy,&quot; said the boy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Billy, I guess you better come with me. I&apos;ll take
                        care of him,&quot; Sinton promised the others. He reached a hand to
                        Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ain&apos;t no baby, I &apos;m a boy!&quot; said
                        Billy, as he shuffled along beside Sinton, taking a kick at every movable
                        object without regard to his battered toes.</p>
                    <p>Once they passed a great Dane dog lolling after its master, and Billy
                        ascended Sinton as if he was a tree, and clung to him with trembling hot
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ain&apos;t afraid of that dog,&quot; scoffed Billy, as he
                        was again placed on the walk, &quot;but onc&apos;t he took me for a
                        rat or somepin&apos; and his teeth cut into my back. If I&apos;d a
                        done right, I &apos;d a took the law on him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton looked down into the indignant little face. The child was bright
                        enough, he had a good head, but, oh, such a body!</p>
                    <p>&quot;I &apos;bout got enough of dogs,&quot; said Billy.
                        &quot;I used to like &apos;em, but I &apos;m getting pretty
                        tired. You ought to seen the lickin&apos; Jimmy and Belle and me give
                        our dog when we caught him, for taking the little bird she gave us. We
                        waited &apos;till he was asleep &apos;nen laid a board on him and
                        all of us jumped on it to onc&apos;t. You could a heard him yell a mile.
                        Belle said mebbe we could <pb id="VAA2373-137" n="128"/> squeeze the bird
                        out of him. But, squeeze nothing! He was holler as us, and that bird was
                        lost long &apos;fore it got to his stummick. It was ist a little one,
                        anyway. Belle said it wouldn&apos;t &apos;a&apos; made a bite
                        apiece for three of us nohow, and the dog got one good swaller. We
                        didn&apos;t get much of the meat, either. Pa took most of that. Seems
                        like pas and dogs gets everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy laughed ruefully. Involuntarily Wesley Sinton reached his hand. They
                        were coming into the business part of Onabasha and the streets were crowded.
                        Billy understood it to mean that he might lose his companion and took a
                        grip. That little hot hand clinging tight to his, the sore feet recklessly
                        scouring the walk, the hungry child panting for breath as he tried to keep
                        even., the brave soul jesting in the face of hard luck, caught Sinton in a
                        tender, empty spot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, son,&quot; he said. &quot;How would you like to be
                        washed clean, and have all the supper your skin could hold, and sleep in a
                        good bed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, gee!&quot; said Billy. &quot;I ain&apos;t dead yet!
                        Them things is in heaven! Poor folks can&apos;t have them. Pa said
                        so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you can have them if you want to go with me and get
                        them,&quot; promised Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Honest!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, honest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Crost yer heart?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-138" n="129"/>
                    <p>&quot;Kin I take some to Jimmy and Belle?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you &apos;ll come with me and be my boy, I &apos;ll see
                        that they have plenty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What will pa say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your pa is in that kind of sleep now where he won&apos;t wake
                        up, Billy,&quot; said Sinton. &quot;I am pretty sure the law will
                        give you to me, if you want to come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When people don&apos;t ever wake up they&apos;re
                        dead,&quot; announced Billy. &quot;Is my pa dead?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, he is,&quot; answered Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you &apos;ll take care of Jimmy and Belle, too?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t adopt all three of you,&quot; said Sinton.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll take you, and see that they are well provided for.
                        Will you come?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yep, I &apos;ll come,&quot; said Billy.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s eat, first thing we do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; agreed Sinton. &quot;Come into this
                        restaurant.&quot; He lifted Billy to the lunch counter and ordered the
                        clerk to give him as many glasses of milk as he wanted, and a biscuit.
                        &quot;I think there&apos;s going to be fried chicken when we get
                        home, Billy,&quot; he said, &quot;so you just take the edge off now,
                        and fill up later.&quot;</p>
                    <p>While Billy lunched Sinton called up the different departments and notified
                        the proper authorities ending with the Women&apos;s Relief Association.
                        He sent a basket of food to Belle and Jimmy, bought Billy a pair of
                        trousers, and a shirt, and went to bring Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Uncle Wesley!&quot; cried the girl. &quot;Where did
                        you find Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-139" n="130"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve adopted him for the time being, if not
                        longer,&quot; replied Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did you get him?&quot; queried the astonished Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, young woman,&quot; said Sinton, &quot;Mr. Brownlee
                        told me the history of your lunch box. It didn&apos;t seem so funny to
                        me as it does to the rest of them; so I went to look up the father of
                        Billy&apos;s family, and make him take care of them, or allow the law to
                        do it for him. It will have to be the law.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s deader than anything!&quot; broke in Billy.
                        &quot;He can&apos;t ever take all the meat any more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy!&quot; gasped Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never you mind!&quot; said Sinton. &quot;A child
                        don&apos;t say such things about a father who loved and raised him
                        right. When it happens, the father alone is to blame. You won&apos;t
                        hear Billy talk like that about me when I cross over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t mean you are going to take him to
                        keep!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll soon need help,&quot; said Sinton.
                        &quot;Billy will come in just about right ten years from now, and if I
                        raise him I&apos;ll have him the way I want him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But Aunt Margaret don&apos;t like boys,&quot; objected
                        Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, she likes me, and I used to be a boy. Anyway, as I remember
                        she has had her way about everything at our house ever since we were
                        married. I am going to please myself about Billy. Hasn&apos;t she always
                        done just as she chose so far as you know? Honest, Elnora!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-140" n="131"/>
                    <p>&quot;Honest!&quot; replied Elnora. &quot;You are beautiful to
                        all of us, Uncle Wesley; but Aunt Margaret won&apos;t like Billy. She
                        won&apos;t want him in her home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In our home,&quot; corrected Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes you want him?&quot; marvelled Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;God only knows,&quot; said Sinton. &quot;Billy
                        ain&apos;t so beautiful, and he ain&apos;t so smart, I guess
                        it&apos;s because he&apos;s so human. My heart goes out to
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So did mine,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I love him.
                        I&apos;d rather see him eat my lunch than have it myself any
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes you like him?&quot; asked Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I don&apos;t know,&quot; pondered Elnora.
                        &quot;He&apos;s so little, he needs so much, he&apos;s got such
                        splendid grit, and he&apos;s perfectly unselfish with his brother and
                        sister. But we must wash him before Aunt Margaret sees him. I wonder if
                        mother?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You needn&apos;t bother. I&apos;m going to take him home
                        the way he is,&quot; said Sinton. &quot;I want Maggie to see the
                        worst of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid&quot; began Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So am I,&quot; said Sinton, &quot;but I won&apos;t give
                        him up. He&apos;s taken a sort of grip on my heart. I&apos;ve always
                        been crazy for a boy. Don&apos;t let him hear us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t let him get killed!&quot; cried Elnora. During
                        their talk Billy had wandered to the edge of the walk and barely escaped the
                        wheels of a passing automobile in an effort to catch a stray kitten that
                        seemed in danger.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-141" n="132"/>
                    <p>Sinton drew Billy back to the walk, and held his hand closely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you ready, Elnora?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; you were gone a long time,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Sinton glanced at a package she carried. &quot;Have to have another
                        book?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I got this for mother. I &apos;ve had such splendid luck
                        selling my specimens, I didn&apos;t feel right about keeping all the
                        money for myself, so I saved enough from the Indian relics to get a few
                        things I wanted. I would have liked to have gotten her a dress, but I
                        didn&apos;t dare, so I compromised on a book.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you select, Elnora?&quot; asked Sinton wonderingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said she, &quot;I have noticed mother always
                        seemed interested in anything Mark Twain wrote in the newspapers, and I
                        thought it would cheer her up a little, so I just got his
                        &quot;Innocents Abroad.&apos; I haven&apos;t read it myself, but
                        I&apos;ve seen mention made of it all my life, and the critics say
                        it&apos;s genuine fun.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good!&quot; cried Sinton. &quot;Good! You &apos;ve made
                        a splendid choice. It will take her mind off herself a lot. But she will
                        scold you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; assented Elnora. But possibly she will read
                        it, and feel better. I&apos;m going to serve her a trick. I am going to
                        hide it until Monday, and set it on her little shelf of books the last thing
                        before I go away. She must have all of them by heart. When she sees a new
                        one she can&apos;t help being <pb id="VAA2373-142" n="133"/> glad, for
                        she loves to read, and if she has all day to get interested, maybe
                        she&apos;ll like it so she won&apos;t scold so much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are both in for it, but I guess we are prepared. I
                        don&apos;t know what Margaret will say, but I&apos;m going to take
                        Billy home and see. Maybe he can win with her, as he did with us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora had her doubts, but she did not say anything more.</p>
                    <p>When they started home Billy sat on the front seat. He drove with the
                        hitching strap tied to the railing of the dashboard, flourished the whip,
                        and yelled with delight. At first Sinton laughed with him, but by the time
                        he left Elnora with several packages at her gate, he was looking serious
                        enough.</p>
                    <p>Margaret was at the door as they drove up the lane. Sinton left Billy in the
                        carriage, hitched the horses and went to explain to her. He had not reached
                        her before she cried, &quot;Look, Wesley, that child! You&apos;ll
                        have a runaway!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley looked and ran. Billy was standing in the carriage slashing the
                        mettlesome horses with the whip.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See me make &apos;em go!&quot; he shouted as the whip fell
                        a second time.</p>
                    <p>He did make them go. They took the hitching post and a few fence palings,
                        which scraped the paint from a wheel. Sinton missed the lines at the first
                        effort, but the dragging post impeded the horses, and he soon caught them.
                        He led them to the barn, <pb id="VAA2373-143" n="134"/> and ordered Billy to
                        remain in the carriage while he unhitched. Then leading Billy and carrying
                        his packages he entered the yard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You run play a few minutes, Billy,&quot; he said. &quot;I
                        want to talk to the nice lady.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The nice lady was looking rather stupefied as Sinton approached her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where in the name of sense did you get that awful child?&quot;
                        she demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is a young gentleman who has been stopping Elnora and eating her
                        lunch every day, part of the time with the assistance of his brother and
                        sister, while our girl went hungry. Brownlee told me about it at the store.
                        It&apos;s happened three days running. The first time she did without
                        anything, the second time Brownlee&apos;s girl took her to lunch, and
                        the third a crowd of high school girls bought a lot of stuff and met them at
                        the bridge. The youngsters seemed to think they could rob her every day, so
                        I went to see their father about having it stopped.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I should think so!&quot; cried Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There were three of them, Margaret,&quot; said Sinton,
                        &quot;that little fellow&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hyena, you mean,&quot; interpolated Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Hyena&apos;,&quot; corrected Sinton gravely,
                        &quot;and another boy and a girl, all equally dirty and hungry. The man
                        was dead. They thought he was in a drunken sleep, but he was stone dead. I
                        brought the little boy with me, and sent the officers and other help to the
                        house.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-144" n="135"/>
                    <p>He&apos;s half starved. I want to wash him, and put clean clothes on him,
                        and give him some supper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you got anything to put on him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did you get it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bought it. It ain&apos;t much. All I got didn&apos;t cost a
                        dollar.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A dollar is a good deal when you work and save for it the way we
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know a better place to put it. Have you got
                        any hot water? I&apos;ll use this tub at the cistern. Please give me
                        some soap and towels.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Instead Margaret pushed by him with a shriek. Billy had played by producing a
                        cord from his pocket, and having tied the tails of Margaret&apos;s white
                        kittens together, he had climbed on a box and hung them across the clothes
                        line. Wild with fright the kittens were clawing each other to death, and the
                        air was white with fur. The string had twisted and the frightened creatures
                        could not recognize friends. Margaret stepped back with bleeding hands.
                        Sinton cut the cord with his knife and the poor little cats raced under the
                        house bleeding and disfigured. Margaret white with wrath faced Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you don&apos;t hitch up and take that animal back to
                        town,&quot; she said, &quot;I will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy threw himself on the grass and began to scream.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You said I could have fried chicken for supper,&quot; he
                        wailed. &quot;You said she was a nice lady!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-145" n="136"/>
                    <p>Sinton lifted him and something in his manner of handling the child
                        infuriated Margaret. His touch was so gentle. She reached for Billy and
                        gripped his shirt collar in the back. Sinton&apos;s hand closed over
                        hers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gently, girl!&quot; he said. &quot;This little body is
                        covered with sores.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sores!&quot; she ejaculated. &quot;Sores? What kind of
                        sores?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, they might be from bruises made by fists or boot toes, or they
                        might be bad blood, from wrong eating, or they might be pure filth. Will you
                        hand me some towels?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I won&apos;t!&quot; said Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, give me some rags, then,&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret compromised on pieces of old tablecloth.</p>
                    <p>Sinton led Billy to the cistern, pumped cold water into the tub, poured in a
                        kettle of hot, and beginning at the head scoured him. The boy shut his
                        little teeth, and said never a word though he twisted occasionally when the
                        soap struck a raw spot. Margaret watched the process from the window in
                        amazed, and ever-increasing anger. Where did Wesley learn it? How could his
                        big hands be so gentle? Sinton came to the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you got any peroxide?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A little,&quot; she answered stiffly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I need about a pint, but I &apos;ll begin on what you
                        have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret handed him the bottle. Wesley took a <pb id="VAA2373-146" n="137"/>
                        cup weakened the drug and said to Billy. &quot;Man, these sores on you
                        must be healed. Then you must eat the kind of food that&apos;s fit for
                        little men. I am going to put some medicine on you, and it is going to sting
                        like fire. If it just runs off, I won&apos;t use any more. If it boils,
                        there is poison in these places, and they must be tied up, dosed every day,
                        and you must be washed, and kept mighty clean. Now, hold still, because I am
                        going to put it on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think the one on my leg is the worst,&quot; said the
                        undaunted Billy, holding out a raw place. Sinton poured on the drug.
                        Billy&apos;s body twisted and writhed, but he did not run.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gee, look at it boil!&quot; he cried. &quot;I guess
                        they&apos;s poison. You &apos;ll have to do it to all of
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton&apos;s teeth were set, as he watched the boy&apos;s face. He
                        poured the drug, strong enough to do effective work, on a dozen places over
                        that little body and bandaged all he could. Billy&apos;s lips quivered
                        at times, and his chin jumped, but he did not shed a tear or utter a sound
                        other than to take a deep interest in the boiling. As Sinton put the small
                        shirt on the boy, and fastened the trousers, he was ready to reset the
                        hitching post and mend the fence without a word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now am I clean?&quot; asked Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you are clean outside,&quot; said Sinton. &quot;There
                        is some dirty blood in your body, and some bad words in your mouth, that we
                        have to get out, but that takes time. If we put right things to eat into
                        your stomach <pb id="VAA2373-147" n="138"/> that will do away with the
                        sores, and if you know that I don&apos;t like bad words you
                        won&apos;t say them any oftener than you can help, will you
                        Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy leaned against Sinton in apparent indifference.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see me!&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>Sinton led the boy into the house, and lifted him to a mirror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My, I&apos;m purty good-looking, ain&apos;t I?&quot;
                        bragged Billy. Then as Sinton stooped to set him on the floor
                        Billy&apos;s lips passed close to the big man&apos;s ear and hastily
                        whispered a vehement &quot;No!&quot; as he ran for the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long until supper, Margaret?&quot; asked Sinton as he
                        followed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are going to keep him for supper?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure!&quot; said Sinton. &quot;That&apos;s what I
                        brought him for. It&apos;s likely he never had a good square meal of
                        decent food in his life. He&apos;s starved to the bone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret arose deliberately, removed the white cloth from the supper table
                        and substituted an old red one she used to wrap the bread. She put away the
                        pretty dishes they commonly used and set the table with old plates for pies
                        and kitchen utensils. But she fried the chicken, and was generous with milk
                        and honey, snowy bread, gravy, potatoes, and fruit.</p>
                    <p>Sinton repainted the scratched wheel. He mended the fence, with Billy holding
                        the nails and handing the pickets. Then he filled the old hole, digged a new
                        one and set the hitching post.</p>
                    <p>Billy hopped on one foot at his task of holding the <pb id="VAA2373-148"
                            n="139"/> post steady as the earth was packed around it. There was not
                        the shadow of a trouble on his little freckled face. Sinton threw in stones
                        and pounded the earth solid around the post. The sound of a gulping sob
                        attracted him to Billy. The tears were rolling down his cheeks. &quot;If
                        I&apos;d a knowed you&apos;d have to get down in a hole, and work so
                        hard I wouldn&apos;t &apos;a&apos; hit the horses,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never you mind, Billy,&quot; said Sinton. &quot;You will
                        know next time, so you can think over it, and make up your mind whether you
                        really want to before you strike.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton went to the barn to put away the tools. He thought Billy at his heels,
                        but the boy lagged on the way. A big snowy turkey gobbler resented the small
                        intruder in his especial preserves, and with spread tail and dragging wings
                        came at him threateningly. If that turkey gobbler had known the sort of
                        things with which Billy was accustomed to holding his own, he never would
                        have issued that challenge. Billy accepted instantly. He danced around with
                        stiff arms at his sides and imitated the gobbler. Then came his opportunity,
                        and he jumped on the big turkey&apos;s back. Wesley heard
                        Margaret&apos;s scream in time to see the flying leap and admire its
                        dexterity. The turkey tucked its tail and scampered. Billy slid from its
                        back and as he fell he clutched wildly, caught the folded tail, and
                        instinctively hung on for life. The turkey gave one scream and relaxed its
                        muscles. Then it fled in disfigured defeat to the haystack. Billy scrambled
                        to his feet holding the tail, and his eyes were bulging.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-149" n="140"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why, the blasted old thing came off!&quot; he said to Sinton,
                        holding out the tail in amazed wonder.</p>
                    <p>Sinton, caught suddenly, forgot everything and roared. Seeing which, Billy
                        thought a turkey tail of no account and flung that one high above him
                        shouting in wild childish laughter, as the feathers scattered and fell.</p>
                    <p>Margaret, watching, burst into tears. Wesley had gone mad. For the first time
                        in her married life she wanted to tell her mother. When Wesley had waited
                        until he was so hungry he could wait no longer he invaded the kitchen to
                        find a cooked supper baking on the back of the stove, while Margaret with
                        red eyes nursed a pair of demoralized white kittens.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is supper ready?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It has been for an hour,&quot; answered Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you call us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>That &quot;us&quot; had too much comradeship in it. It irritated
                        Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I supposed it would take you even longer than that to fix things
                        decent again. As for my turkey, and my poor little kittens, they
                        don&apos;t matter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am mighty sorry about them, Margaret, you know that. Billy is
                        very bright, and he will soon learn&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Soon learn!&quot; cried Margaret. &quot;Wesley Sinton, you
                        don&apos;t mean to say that you think of keeping that creature here for
                        some time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I think of keeping a decent, well-behaved little boy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret set the supper on the table. Seeing the <pb id="VAA2373-150" n="141"
                        /> old red cloth Wesley stared in amazement. Then he understood. Billy
                        capered around in delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ain&apos;t that pretty?&quot; he exulted. &quot;I wish
                        Jimmy and Belle could see. We, why we ist eat out of our hands or off a old
                        drygoods box, and when we fix up a lot, we have newspaper. We ain&apos;t
                        ever had a nice red cloth like this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley looked straight at Margaret, so intently that she turned away, her
                        face flushing. He stacked the dictionary and the geography of the world on a
                        chair, and lifted Billy beside him. He heaped a plate generously, cut the
                        food, put a fork into Billy&apos;s little fist, and made him eat slowly
                        and properly. Billy did his best. Occasionally greed overcame him, and he
                        used his left hand to pop a bite into his mouth with his fingers. These
                        lapses Wesley patiently overlooked, and went on with his general
                        instructions. Luckily Billy did not spill anything on his clothing or the
                        cloth. After supper Wesley took him to the barn until he finished the night
                        work. Then he went and sat by Margaret on the front porch. Billy
                        appropriated the hammock, and swung by pulling a rope tied around a tree.
                        The very energy with which he went at the work of swinging himself appealed
                        to Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mercy, but he&apos;s an active little body,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There isn&apos;t a lazy bone in him. See how he works to pay
                        for his fun.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There goes his foot through it!&quot; cried Margaret.
                        &quot;Wesley, he shall not ruin my hammock.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-151" n="142"/>
                    <p>&quot;Of course he shan&apos;t!&quot; said Wesley.
                        &quot;Wait, Billy, let me show you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thereupon he explained to Billy that ladies wearing beautiful white dresses
                        sat in hammocks, so little boys must not put their dusty feet in them. They
                        must just sit in them, and let their feet hang down. Billy immediately sat,
                        and allowed his feet to swing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Margaret,&quot; said Sinton after a long silence on the porch,
                        &quot;isn&apos;t it true that if Billy had been a half-starved sore
                        cat, dog, or animal of any sort, that you would have pitied, and helped care
                        for it, and been glad to see me get any pleasure out of it I
                        could?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Margaret coldly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But because I brought a child with an immortal soul, there is no
                        welcome.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That isn&apos;t a child, it&apos;s an animal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You just said you would have welcomed an animal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a wild one. I meant a tame beast.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy is not a beast!&quot; said Wesley hotly. &quot;He is
                        a very dear little boy. Margaret, you&apos;ve always done the
                        church-going and Bible reading for this family. How do you reconcile that
                        &quot;Suffer little children to come unto Me&apos; with the way you
                        are treating Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret arose. &quot;I haven&apos;t treated that child. I have only
                        let him alone. I can barely hold myself. He needs the hide tanned about off
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you&apos;d cared to look at his body, you&apos;d know
                        that you couldn&apos;t find a place to strike without cutting into a raw
                        spot,&quot; said Sinton. &quot;Besides, Billy has not done <pb
                            id="VAA2373-152" n="143"/> a thing for which a child should be punished.
                        He is only full of life, no training, and with a boy&apos;s love of
                        mischief. He did abuse your kittens, but an hour before I saw him risk his
                        life to save one from being run over. He minds what you tell him, and
                        doesn&apos;t do anything he is told not to. He thinks of his brother and
                        sister right away when anything pleases him. He took that stinging medicine
                        with the grit of a bulldog. He is just a bully little chap, and I love
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, good heavens!&quot; cried Margaret, going into the house as
                        she spoke.</p>
                    <p>Sinton sat still. At last Billy tired of the swing, came to him and leaned
                        his slight body against the big knee.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I going to sleep here?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure you are!&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <p>Billy swung his feet as he laid across Wesley&apos;s knee. &quot;Come
                        on,&quot; said Sinton, &quot;I must clean you up for bed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have to be just awful clean here,&quot; announced Billy.
                        &quot;I like to be clean, you feel so good, after the hurt is
                        over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton registered that remark, and worked with especial tenderness as he
                        redressed the ailing places and washed the dust from Billy&apos;s feet
                        and hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where can he sleep?&quot; he asked Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t know,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can sleep ist any place,&quot; said Billy. &quot;On
                        the floor or anywhere. Home, I sleep on pa&apos;s coat on a storebox,
                        and Jimmy and Belle they sleep on the storebox, too. I sleep between them,
                        so&apos;s I don&apos;t roll <pb id="VAA2373-153" n="144"/> off and
                        crack my head. Ain&apos;t you got a storebox and a old coat?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton arose and opened a folding lounge. Then he brought an armload of clean
                        horse blankets from a closet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;These don&apos;t look like the nice white bed a little boy
                        should have, Billy,&quot; he said, &quot;but we&apos;ll make
                        them do. This will beat a storebox all hollow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy took a long leap for the lounge. When he found it bounced, he proceeded
                        to bounce, until he was tired. By that time the blankets had to be refolded.
                        Wesley had Billy take one end and help, while both of them seemed to enjoy
                        the job. Then Billy lay down and curled up in his clothes like a little dog.
                        But sleep would not come. Finally he sat up. He stared around restlessly.
                        Then he arose, went to Sinton, and leaned against his knee. Sinton picked up
                        the boy and folded his arms around him. Billy sighed in rapturous content.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That bed feels so lost like,&quot; he said. &quot;Jimmy
                        always jabbed me on one side, and Belle on the other, and so I knew I was
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton laughed the best he could.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know where they are?&quot; asked Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are with kind people who gave them a fine supper, a clean bed,
                        and will always take good care of them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wisht I was&quot;Billy hesitated and looked earnestly at
                        Sinton. &quot;I mean, I wish they was here.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-154" n="145"/>
                    <p>&quot;You are about all I can manage, Billy,&quot; said Sinton. Billy
                        sat up. &quot;Can&apos;t she manage anything?&quot; he asked,
                        waving toward Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed, yes,&quot; said Sinton. &quot;She has managed me
                        for twenty years.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My, but she made you nice!&quot; said Billy. &quot;I just
                        love you. I wisht she&apos;d take Jimmy and Belle and make them nice as
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She isn&apos;t strong enough to do that, Billy. They will grow
                        into a good boy and girl where they are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy slid from Sinton&apos;s arms and walked toward Margaret until he
                        reached the middle of the room. Then he stopped, and at last sat on the
                        floor. Finally he lay down and closed his eyes. &quot;This feels more
                        like my bed; if only Jimmy and Belle was here to crowd up a little, so it
                        wasn&apos;t so alone like.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t I do, Billy?&quot; asked Sinton in a husky
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>Billy moved restlessly. &quot;Seems likeseems liketowards night as if a
                        body got kind o&apos; lonesome for a woman personlike her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy indicated Margaret and then closed his eyes so tight his small face
                        wrinkled.</p>
                    <p>Soon he was up again. &quot;&apos;Wisht I had Snap,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;Oh, I ist wisht I had Snap!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you laid a board on Snap and jumped on it,&quot; said
                        Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We did!&quot; cried Billy&quot;oh, you ought to heard him
                        squeal!&quot; Billy laughed loudly, then his face clouded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I want Snap to lay beside me so bad nowthat <pb
                            id="VAA2373-155" n="146"/> if he was here I&apos;d give him a piece
                        of my chicken, &apos;fore I ate any. Do you like dogs?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <p>Billy was up instantly. &quot;Would you like Snap?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sure I would,&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would she?&quot; Billy indicated Margaret. And then he answered
                        his own question. &quot;But of course, she wouldn&apos;t, cos she
                        likes cats, and dogs chases cats. Oh, dear, I thought for a minute maybe
                        Snap could come here.&quot; Billy lay down and closed his eyes
                        resolutely.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly they flew open. &quot;Does it hurt to be dead?&quot; he
                        demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing hurts you after you are dead, Billy,&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but I mean does it hurt getting to be dead?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sometimes it does. It did not hurt your father, Billy. It came
                        softly while he was asleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It ist came softly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I kind o&apos; wisht he wasn&apos;t dead!&quot; said
                        Billy. &quot;&apos;Course I like to stay with you, and the fried
                        chicken, and the nice soft bed, andand everything, and I like to be clean,
                        but he took us to the show, and he got us gum, and he never hurt us when he
                        wasn&apos;t drunk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy drew a deep breath, and tightly closed his eyes. But very soon they
                        opened. Then he sat up. He looked at Sinton pitifully, and then he glanced
                        at Margaret. &quot;You don&apos;t like boys, do you?&quot; he
                        questioned.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-156" n="147"/>
                    <p>&quot;I like good boys,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
                    <p>Billy was at her knee instantly. &quot;Well, say, I&apos;m a good
                        boy!&quot; he announced joyously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not think boys who hurt helpless kittens and pull out
                        turkeys&apos; tails are good boys.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but I didn&apos;t hurt the kittens,&quot; explained
                        Billy. &quot;They got mad &apos;bout ist a little fun and scratched
                        each other. I didn&apos;t s&apos;pose they&apos;d act like that.
                        And I didn&apos;t pull the turkey&apos;s tail. I ist held on to the
                        first thing I grabbed, and the turkey pulled. Honest, it was the turkey
                        pulled.&quot; He turned to Sinton. &quot;You tell her!
                        Didn&apos;t the turkey pull? I didn&apos;t know its tail was loose,
                        did I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think you did, Billy,&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <p>Billy stared into Margaret&apos;s cold face. &quot;Sometimes at
                        night, Belle sits on the floor, and I lay my head in her lap. I could pull
                        up a chair and lay my head in your lap. Like this, I mean.&quot; Billy
                        pulled up a chair, climbed on it and laid his head on Margaret&apos;s
                        lap. Then he shut his eyes again. Margaret could have looked little more
                        repulsed if he had been a snake.</p>
                    <p>Billy was soon up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My, but your lap is hard,&quot; he said. &quot;And you are
                        a good deal fatter &apos;an Belle, too!&quot; He slid from the chair
                        and came back to the middle of the room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, but I wisht he wasn&apos;t dead!&quot; he cried. The
                        flood broke and Billy screamed in desperation.</p>
                    <p>Out of the night a soft, warm young figure flashed through the door and with
                        a swoop caught him in her <pb id="VAA2373-157" n="148"/> arms. She dropped
                        into a chair, nestled him closely, and drooped her fragrant brown head over
                        his little bullet-eyed red one, and rocked softly as she crooned over him</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Billy, boy, where have you been?</l>
                        <l n="2">Oh, I have been to seek a wife,</l>
                        <l n="3">She&apos;s the joy of my life,</l>
                        <l n="4">But then she&apos;s a young thing and she can&apos;t leave
                            her mammy!&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>Billy gripped her with a death grip. Elnora wiped his eyes, kissed his face,
                        swayed and sang.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why aren&apos;t you asleep?&quot; she asked at last.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Billy. &quot;I tried. I
                        tried awful hard &apos;cos I thought he wanted me to, but it ist
                        wouldn&apos;t come. Please tell her I tried.&quot; He appealed to
                        Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He did try to go to sleep,&quot; admitted Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe he can&apos;t sleep in his clothes,&quot; suggested
                        Elnora. &quot;Haven&apos;t you an old dressing sacque? I could roll
                        the sleeves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret got an old sacque, and Elnora put it on Billy. Then she brought a
                        basin of water and bathed his face and head. She gathered him up and began
                        to rock again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you got a pa?&quot; asked Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is he dead like mine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did it hurt him to die?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy was wide awake again. &quot;It didn&apos;t hurt my <pb
                            id="VAA2373-158" n="149"/> pa,&quot; he boasted; &quot;he ist
                        died while he was asleep. He didn&apos;t even know it was
                        coming.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad of that,&quot; said Elnora, pressing the little head
                        against her breast again.</p>
                    <p>Billy escaped her hand and sat up. &quot;I guess I won&apos;t go to
                        sleep,&quot; he said. &quot;It might &quot;come softly&apos;
                        and get me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It won&apos;t get you, Billy,&quot; said Elnora, rocking
                        and singing between sentences. &quot;It don&apos;t get little boys.
                        It just takes big people who are sick.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was my pa sick?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;He had a dreadful sickness
                        inside him that burned, and made him drink things. That was why he would
                        forget his little boys and girl. If he had been well, he would have gotten
                        you good things to eat, clean clothes, and had the most fun with
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy leaned against her and closed his eyes, and Elnora rocked hopefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I was dead would you cry?&quot; he was up again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I would,&quot; said Elnora gripping him closer until Billy
                        almost squealed with the embrace.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you love me tight as that?&quot; he questioned blissfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, bushels and bushels,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Better
                        than any little boy in the whole world.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy looked at Margaret. &quot;She don&apos;t!&quot; he said.
                        &quot;She&apos;d be glad if it would get me
                        &quot;softly,&apos; right now. She don&apos;t want me here
                        &apos;t all.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-159" n="150"/>
                    <p>Elnora smothered his face against her breast and rocked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You love me, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will, if you will go to sleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Every single day you will give me your dinner for the bologna,
                        won&apos;t you,&quot; said Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; replied Elnora. &quot;But you will have
                        as good lunch as I do after this. You will have milk, eggs, chicken, all
                        kinds of good things, little pies, and cakes, maybe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy shook his head. &quot;I am going back home soon as it is
                        light,&quot; he said, &quot;she don&apos;t want me. She thinks
                        I&apos;m a bad boy. She&apos;s going to whip meif he lets her. She
                        said so. I heard her. Oh, I wish he hadn&apos;t died! I want to go
                        home.&quot; Billy shrieked again.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock had started to walk slowly and meet Elnora. The girl had been
                        so late that her mother reached the Sinton gate and came up the path until
                        the picture inside became visible. Elnora had told her about Sinton taking
                        Billy home. Mrs. Comstock had some curiosity to see how Margaret bore the
                        unexpected addition to her family. Billy&apos;s voice raised with
                        excitement, was plainly audible. She could see Elnora holding him, and hear
                        his excited wail. Sinton&apos;s face was drawn and haggard, and
                        Margaret&apos;s set and defiant. A very imp of perversity entered the
                        breast of Mrs. Comstock and danced there.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hoity, toity!&quot; she said as she suddenly appeared <pb
                            id="VAA2373-160" n="151"/> in the door. &quot;Blest if I ever heard
                        a man making sounds like that before!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy ceased suddenly. Mrs. Comstock was tall, angular, and her hair was
                        prematurely white, for she was only thirty-six, though she looked fifty. But
                        there was an expression on her usually cold face that was attractive just
                        then, and Billy was in search of attractions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have I stayed too late, mother?&quot; asked Elnora anxiously.
                        &quot;I truly intended to come straight back, but I thought I could get
                        Billy to sleep first. Every-thing is strange, and he&apos;s so
                        nervous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that your ma?&quot; demanded Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does she love you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My mother didn&apos;t love me,&quot; said Billy.
                        &quot;She went away and left me, and never came back. She don&apos;t
                        care what happens to me. You wouldn&apos;t go away and leave your little
                        girl, would you?&quot; questioned Billy of Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Katharine Comstock, &quot;and I
                        wouldn&apos;t leave a little boy, either.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy was half off Elnora&apos;s knees.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you like boys?&quot; he questioned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If there is anything I love it is a boy,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Comstock assuringly. Billy was on the floor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you like dogs?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Almost as well as boys. I am going to buy a dog just as soon
                        as I can find a good one.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-161" n="152"/>
                    <p>Billy swept toward her with a whoop.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want a boy?&quot; he shouted.</p>
                    <p>Katharine Comstock stretched out her arms, and gathered him in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, I want a boy!&quot; she rejoiced.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe you&apos;d like to have me?&quot; offered Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure I would,&quot; triumphed Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Anyone
                        would like to have you. You are just a real boy, Billy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you take Snap?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like to have Snap almost as well as you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother!&quot; breathed Elnora imploringly.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t! Oh, don&apos;t! He thinks you mean
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And so I do mean it,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll take him in a jiffy. I throw away enough to feed a
                        little tyke like him every day. His chatter would be great company while you
                        are gone. Blood soon can be purified with right food and baths, and as for
                        Snap, I meant to get a bulldog, but possibly Snap will serve just as well.
                        All I ask of a dog is to bark at the right time. I&apos;ll do the rest.
                        Would you like to come and be my boy, Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy leaned against Mrs. Comstock, reached his arms around her neck and
                        gripped her with all his puny might. &quot;You can whip me all you want
                        to,&quot; he said. &quot;I won&apos;t make a sound.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock held him closely and her hard face was softening, of that there
                        could not be a doubt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, why would anyone whip a nice little boy like you?&quot;
                        she asked wonderingly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-162" n="153"/>
                    <p>&quot;She&quot;Billy from his refuge waved toward
                        Margaret&quot;she was going to whip me &apos;cause her cats fought,
                        when I tied their tails together and hung them over the line to dry. How did
                        I know her old cats would fight?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock began to laugh suddenly, and try as she would she could not
                        stop as soon as she desired. Billy studied her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you got turkeys?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, flocks of them,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock, vainly
                        struggling to suppress her mirth, and settle her face in its accustomed
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are their tails fast?&quot; demanded Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I think so,&quot; marvelled Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hers ain&apos;t!&quot; said Billy with the wave toward
                        Margaret that was becoming familiar. &quot;Her turkey pulled, and its
                        tail comed right off. She&apos;s going to whip me if he lets her. I
                        didn&apos;t know the turkey would pull. I didn&apos;t know its tail
                        would come off. I won&apos;t ever touch one again, will I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, you won&apos;t,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;And what&apos;s more, I don&apos;t care if you do!
                        I&apos;d rather have a fine little man like you than all the turkeys in
                        the country. Let them lose their old tails if they want to, and let the cats
                        fight. Cats and turkeys don&apos;t compare with boys, who are going to
                        be fine big men some of these days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then Billy and Mrs. Comstock hugged each other rapturously, and their
                        audience stared in silent amazement.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-163" n="154"/>
                    <p>&quot;You like boys!&quot; exulted Billy, and his head dropped
                        against Mrs. Comstock in unspeakable content.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and if I don&apos;t have to carry you the whole way home,
                        we must start right now,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;You are
                        going to be asleep before you know it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy opened his eyes and braced himself. &quot;I can walk,&quot; he
                        said proudly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right, we must start. Come, Elnora! Good night,
                        folks!&quot; Mrs. Comstock set Billy on the floor, and arose gripping
                        his hand. &quot;You take the other side, Elnora, and we will help him as
                        much as we can,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Elnora stared piteously at Margaret, then at Wesley, and arose in white-faced
                        bewilderment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy, are you going to leave without even saying good-bye to
                        me?&quot; asked Sinton, with a great gulp in his throat.</p>
                    <p>Billy held tight to Mrs. Comstock and Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-bye!&quot; he said casually. &quot;I&apos;ll come
                        and see you some time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley Sinton gave a smothered sob, and strode from the room.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock started for the door, dragging at Billy as Elnora pulled back,
                        but Mrs. Sinton was before them, her eyes flashing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kate Comstock, you think you are mighty smart, don&apos;t
                        you?&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ain&apos;t in the lunatic asylum, where you belong,
                        anyway,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I am smart enough <pb
                            id="VAA2373-164" n="155"/> to tell a dandy boy when I see him, and
                        I&apos;m good and glad to get him. I&apos;ll love to have
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you won&apos;t have him!&quot; exclaimed Margaret
                        Sinton. &quot;That boy is Wesley&apos;s! He got him, and brought him
                        here. You can&apos;t come in and take him like that! Let go of
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not much, I won&apos;t!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;Leave the poor sick little soul here for you to beat, because he
                        didn&apos;t know just how to handle things! Of course, he &apos;ll
                        make mistakes. He&apos;s got to have a lot of teaching, but not the kind
                        he&apos;ll get from you! Clear out of my way!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You let go of our boy,&quot; ordered Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why? Do you want to whip him, before he can go to sleep?&quot;
                        jeered Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I don&apos;t!&quot; said Margaret.
                        &quot;He&apos;s Wesley&apos;s, and nobody shall touch him.
                        Wesley!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley Sinton appeared behind Margaret in the doorway, and she turned to him.
                        &quot;Make Kate Comstock let go of our boy!&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy, she wants you now,&quot; said Wesley Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She won&apos;t whip you, and she won&apos;t let anyone
                        else. You can have stacks of good things to eat, ride in the carriage, and
                        have a great time. Won&apos;t you stay with us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy drew away from Mrs. Comstock and Elnora.</p>
                    <p>He faced Margaret, his eyes shrewd with unchildish wisdom. Necessity had
                        taught him to strike the hot iron, to drive the hard bargain.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can I have Snap to live here always?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-165" n="156"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you can have all the dogs you want,&quot; said Margaret
                        Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can I sleep close enough so&apos;s I can touch you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you can move your lounge up so that you can hold my
                        hand,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you love me now?&quot; questioned Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll try to love you if you are a good boy,&quot; said
                        Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I guess I&apos;ll stay,&quot; said Billy walking over
                        to her.</p>
                    <p>Out in the night Elnora and her mother went down the road in the moonlight,
                        and every few rods Mrs. Comstock laughed aloud.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother, I don&apos;t understand you,&quot; sobbed Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, maybe when you have gone to high school longer you
                        will,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Anyway, you saw me bring Mag
                        Sinton to her senses, didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I did,&quot; answered Elnora, &quot;but I thought you
                        were in earnest. So did Billy, and Uncle Wesley, and Aunt
                        Margaret.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, wasn&apos;t I?&quot; inquired Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you just said you brought Aunt Margaret to!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, didn&apos;t I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the reason I am recommending more
                        schooling!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora took her candle and went to bed. Mrs. Comstock was feeling too good to
                        sleep. Twice of late she really had enjoyed herself for the first in sixteen
                        years, <pb id="VAA2373-166" n="157"/> and a sort of greediness for more of
                        the same feeling crept into her blood like intoxication. As she sat brooding
                        alone she knew the truth. She would have loved to take Billy. She would not
                        have minded his mischief, his chatter, or his dog. He would have meant a
                        sort of salvation from herself that she greatly needed, she was even sincere
                        about the dog. She meant to tell Sinton to buy her one at the very first
                        opportunity. Her last thought was of Billy. She chuckled softly, for she was
                        not saintly, and now she knew what she could do that would fill her soul
                        with grim satisfaction.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">MMEDIATELY</hi> after dinner on Sunday Wesley Sinton stopped
                        at the Comstock gate to ask if Elnora wanted to go to town with them. Billy
                        sat beside him and he did not look as if he were on his way to a funeral.
                        Elnora said she had to study and could not go, but she suggested that her
                        mother take her place. Mrs. Comstock put on her hat and went at once, which
                        surprised Elnora. She did not know that her mother was anxious for an
                        opportunity to speak with Sinton alone. Elnora knew why she was repeatedly
                        cautioned not to leave their land, if she went specimen hunting, to remain
                        along the roads, or at least not to enter the swamp.</p>
                    <p>She studied two hours and was several lessons ahead of her classes. There was
                        no use to go further. She would take a walk and see if she could gather any
                        caterpillars or find any freshly spun cocoons. She searched the bushes and
                        low trees behind the garden and all about the edge of the woods on their
                        land, and having little success, at last came out to the road. Almost the
                        first thorn bush she examined yielded a Polyphemus <pb id="VAA2373-168"
                            n="159"/> cocoon. Elnora lifted her head with the instinct of a hunter
                        on the chase, and began work. She reached the swamp before she knew it,
                        carrying five fine cocoons of different species as her reward. She pushed
                        back her hair and gazed around longingly. A few rods inside she thought she
                        saw cocoons on a bush, to which she went, and found several. Sense of
                        caution was rapidly vanishing, she was in a fair way to forget everything
                        and plunge into the swamp when she thought she heard footsteps coming down
                        the trail. She went back, and came out almost facing Pete Corson.</p>
                    <p>That ended her difficulty. She had known him since childhood. When she sat on
                        the front bench of the Brushwood schoolhouse, Pete had been one of the big
                        boys at the back of the room. He had been rough and wild, but she never had
                        been afraid of him, and often he had given her pretty things from the swamp.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What luck!&quot; she cried. &quot;I promised mother I would
                        not go inside the swamp alone, and will you look at the cocoons
                        I&apos;ve found! There are more just screaming for me to come get them,
                        because the leaves will fall with the first frost, and then the jays and
                        crows will begin to tear them open. I haven&apos;t much time, since
                        I&apos;m going to school. You will go with me, Pete! Please say yes!
                        Just a little way!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are those things?&quot; asked the man, his keen black eyes
                        fast upon her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are the cases these big caterpillars spin for winter, and in
                        the spring they come out great night <pb id="VAA2373-169" n="160"/> moths,
                        and I can sell them. Oh, Pete, I can sell them for enough to take me through
                        high school and dress me so like the rest that I don&apos;t look
                        different, and if I have very good luck I can save some for college. Pete,
                        please go with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you go like you always have?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, the truth is, I had a little scare,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never did mean to go alone; sometimes I sort of wandered inside
                        farther than I intended, chasing things. You know Duncan gave me
                        Freckles&apos;s books, and I have been gathering moths like he did.
                        Lately I found I could sell them. If I can make a complete collection, I can
                        get three hundred dollars for it. Three such collections would take me
                        almost through college, and I&apos;ve four years in the high school yet.
                        That&apos;s a long time. I might get them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can every kind there is be found here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, not all of them, but when I get more than I need of one kind, I
                        can trade them with collectors farther north and west, so I can complete
                        sets. It&apos;s the only way I see to earn the money. Look what I have
                        already. Big gray Cecropias come from this kind; brown Polyphemus from that,
                        and green Lunas from these. You aren&apos;t working on Sunday. Go with
                        me just an hour, Pete!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man looked at her narrowly. She was young, wholesome, and beautiful. She
                        was innocent, intensely in earnest, and she needed the money, he knew that.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t tell me what scared you,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-170" n="161"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I thought I did! Why, you know, I had Freckles&apos;s box
                        packed full of moths and specimens, and one evening I sold some to the Bird
                        Woman. Next morning I found a note telling me it wasn&apos;t safe to go
                        inside the swamp. That sort of scared me. I think I&apos;ll go alone,
                        rather than miss the chance, but I&apos;d be so happy if you would take
                        care of me. Then I could go anywhere I chose, because if I mired you could
                        pull me out. You will take care of me, Pete?&quot;</p>
                    <p>That was the finishing stroke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I&apos;ll take care of you,&quot; promised Pete
                        Corson.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Goody!&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Let &apos;s start
                        quick! And Pete, you look at these closely, and when you are hunting or
                        going along the road, if one dangles under your nose, you cut off the little
                        twig and save it for me, will you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I&apos;ll save you all I see,&quot; promised Pete. He
                        pushed back his hat and followed Elnora. She plunged fearlessly through
                        bushes, over underbrush, and across dead logs. One minute she was crying
                        wildly, that here was a big one, the next she was reaching for a limb above
                        her head or on her knees overturning dead leaves under a hickory or oak
                        tree, or pushing aside black muck with her bare hands as she searched for
                        buried pup cases. For the first hour Pete bent back bushes and followed,
                        carrying what Elnora discovered. Then he found one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is this the kind of thing you are looking for?&quot; he asked,
                        bashfully, as he presented a wild cherry twig.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-171" n="162"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Pete, that&apos;s a Promethea! I didn&apos;t even hope
                        to find one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the bird like?&quot; asked Pete.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Almost black wings,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;with
                        clay-coloured edges, and the most wonderful wine-coloured flush over the
                        under side if it&apos;s a male, and stronger wine above and below if
                        it&apos;s a female. Oh, aren&apos;t I happy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would it do to make what you have into a bunch that we could
                        leave here, and come back for them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That would be all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Relieved of his load Pete began work. First, he narrowly examined the cocoons
                        Elnora had found. He questioned her as to what other kinds would be like. He
                        began to use the eyes of a trained woodman and hunter in her behalf. He saw
                        several so easily, and moved through the forest so softly, that Elnora
                        forgot the moths in watching him. Presently she was carrying the specimens,
                        and he was making the trips of investigation to see which was a cocoon and
                        which a curled leaf, or he was down on his knees digging around stumps. As
                        he worked he kept asking questions. What kind of logs were best to look
                        beside, what trees were pup cases most likely to be under; on what bushes
                        did caterpillars spin most frequently? Time passed, as it always does when
                        one&apos;s occupation is absorbing.</p>
                    <p>When the Sintons had taken Mrs. Comstock home, they stopped to see if Elnora
                        was safe. She was not at home, and they had not seen her along the way. Mrs.
                        Comstock called about the edge of her woods and <pb id="VAA2373-172" n="163"
                        /> received no reply. Then Sinton turned and drove back to the Limberlost.
                        He left Margaret and Mrs. Comstock holding the team and entertaining Billy,
                        and entered the swamp.</p>
                    <p>Elnora and Pete had left a wide trail behind them. Before Sinton had thought
                        of calling, he heard voices and approached with some caution. Soon he saw
                        Elnora, her flushed face beaming as she bent with an armload of twigs and
                        branches and talked to a kneeling man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now go cautiously!&quot; she was saying. &quot;I am just
                        sure we will find an Imperialis here. It&apos;s their very kind of a
                        place. There! What did I tell you! Isn&apos;t that splendid? Oh, I am so
                        glad you came with me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton stood and stared in speechless astonishment, for the man had risen,
                        brushed the dirt from his hands, and held out to Elnora a small shining dark
                        pupa case. As his face swung into view Sinton almost cried out, for he was
                        the one man of all others Wesley knew with whom he most feared for
                        Elnora&apos;s safety. She had him on his knees digging pupa cases for
                        her from the loose swamp loam.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora!&quot; called Sinton. &quot;Elnora!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Uncle Wesley!&quot; cried the girl. &quot;See what luck
                        we&apos;ve had! I know we have a dozen and a half cocoons and we have
                        three pupa cases. It&apos;s much harder to get the cases because you
                        have to dig for them, and you can&apos;t see where to look. But Pete is
                        fine at it! He&apos;s found three, and he says he will keep watch along
                            <pb id="VAA2373-173" n="164"/> the roads, and through the woods as he
                        hunts. Isn&apos;t that splendid of him? Uncle Wesley, there is a college
                        over there on the western edge of the swamp. Look closely, and you can see
                        the great dome up among the clouds.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should say you have had luck,&quot; said Sinton striving to
                        make his voice natural. &quot;But I thought you were not coming to the
                        swamp?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I wasn&apos;t,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;but I
                        couldn&apos;t find many anywhere else, honest, I couldn&apos;t, and
                        just as soon as I came to the edge I began to see them here. I kept my
                        promise. I didn&apos;t come in alone. Pete came with me. He&apos;s
                        so strong, he isn&apos;t afraid of anything, and he&apos;s perfectly
                        splendid to locate cocoons! He&apos;s found half of these. Come on,
                        Pete, it&apos;s getting dark now, and we must go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They started for the trail, Pete carrying the cocoons. He left them at the
                        case, while Elnora and Sinton went on to the carriage together.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora Comstock, what does this mean?&quot; demanded her
                        mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all right, one of the neighbours was with her, and
                        she got several dollars&apos; worth of stuff,&quot; interposed
                        Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You oughter seen my pa,&quot; shouted Billy. &quot;He was
                        &apos;ist all whited out, and he laid as still as anything. They put him
                        away deep in the ground.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy!&quot; breathed Margaret in a prolonged groan.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jimmy and Belle are going to be together in a nice <pb
                            id="VAA2373-174" n="165"/> place. They are coming to see me, and Snap is
                        right down here by the wheel. Here, Snap! My, but he&apos;ll be tickled
                        to get something to eat! He&apos;s &apos;most twisted as me. They
                        got new clothes, and all they want to eat, too, but they&apos;ll miss
                        me. They couldn&apos;t have got along without me. I took care of them. I
                        had a lot of things give to me &apos;cause I was the littlest, and I
                        always divided with them. But they won&apos;t need me now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she left the carriage Mrs. Comstock gravely shook hands with Billy.
                        &quot;Remember,&quot; she said to him, &quot;I love boys, and I
                        love dogs. Whenever you don&apos;t have a good time up there, take your
                        dog and come right down and be my little boy. We will just have loads of
                        fun. You should hear the whistles I can make. If you aren&apos;t treated
                        right you come straight to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy wagged his head sagely. &quot;You &apos;ist bet I
                        will!&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother, how could you?&quot; asked Elnora as they walked up the
                        path.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How could I, missy? You better ask how couldn&apos;t I? I just
                        couldn&apos;t! Not for enough to pay my road tax! Not for enough to pay
                        the road tax, and the dredge tax, too!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aunt Margaret always has been lovely to me, and I don&apos;t
                        think it&apos;s fair to worry her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I choose to be lovely to Billy, and let her sweat out her own
                        worries just as she has me, these sixteen years. There is nothing in all
                        this world so good for people as getting a dose of their own medicine. The
                        difference is <pb id="VAA2373-175" n="166"/> that I am honest. I just say in
                        plain English, &quot;if they don&apos;t treat you right, come to
                        me.&apos; They have only said it in actions and inferences. I want to
                        teach Mag Sinton how her own doses taste, but she begins to sputter before I
                        fairly get the spoon to her lips. Just you wait!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When I think what I owe her&quot; began Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, thank goodness, I don&apos;t owe her anything, and so
                        I&apos;m perfectly free to do what I choose. Come on, and help me get
                        supper. I&apos;m hungry as Billy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret Sinton rocked slowly back and forth in her chair. On her breast lay
                        Billy&apos;s red head, one hand clutched her dress front with spasmodic
                        grip, even after he was unconscious.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t begin that, Margaret,&quot; said Sinton.
                        &quot;He&apos;s too heavy. And it&apos;s bad for him.
                        He&apos;s better off to lie down and go to sleep alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s very light, Wesley. He jumps and quivers so. He has
                        to be stronger than he is now, before he will sleep soundly.&quot;</p>

                    <p>E<hi rend="sc">LNORA</hi> missed the little figure at the bridge the next
                        morning. She slowly walked up the street and turned in at the wide entrance
                        to the school grounds. She scarcely could comprehend that only a week ago
                        she had gone there friendless, alone, and so sick at heart that she was
                        physically ill. To-day she had decent clothing, books, friends, and her mind
                        was at ease to work on her studies.</p>
                    <p>As she approached home that night the girl paused in amazement. Her mother
                        had company, and she was laughing. Elnora entered the kitchen softly and
                        peeped into the sitting room. Mrs. Comstock sat in her chair holding a book
                        and every few seconds a soft chuckle broke into a real laugh. Mark Twain was
                        doing his work; while Mrs. Comstock was not lacking in a sense of humour.
                        Elnora entered the room before her mother saw her. Mrs. Comstock looked up
                        with flushed face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did you get this?&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bought it,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bought it! With all the taxes due!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I paid for it out of my Indian money, mother,&quot; said
                        Elnora. &quot;I couldn&apos;t bear to spend so much on myself <pb
                            id="VAA2373-177" n="168"/> and nothing at all on you. I was afraid to
                        buy the dress I should have liked to, and I thought the book would be
                        company, while I was gone. I haven&apos;t read it, but I do hope
                        it&apos;s good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good! It&apos;s the biggest piece of foolishness I have read in
                        all my life. I&apos;ve laughed all day, ever since I found it. I had a
                        notion to go out and read some of it to the cows and see if they
                        wouldn&apos;t laugh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If it made you laugh, it&apos;s a wise book,&quot; said
                        Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wise!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock. &quot;You can stake your
                        life it&apos;s a wise book. It takes the smartest man there is to do
                        this kind of fooling,&quot; and she began laughing again.</p>
                    <p>Elnora, highly satisfied with her purchase, went to her room and put on her
                        working clothes. Thereafter she made a point of getting a book that she
                        thought would interest her mother, from the library every week, and leaving
                        it on the sitting-room table. Every night she carried home at least two
                        school books and studied until she had mastered the points of each lesson.
                        She did her share of the work faithfully, and every available minute she was
                        in the fields searching for cocoons, for the moths promised to become her
                        best source of income.</p>
                    <p>She gathered large baskets of nests, flowers, mosses, insects, and all sorts
                        of natural history specimens and sold them to the grade teachers. At first
                        she tried to tell these instructors what to teach their pupils about the
                        specimens; but recognizing how much more she knew than they, one after
                        another begged her to study at home, <pb id="VAA2373-178" n="169"/> and use
                        her spare hours in school to exhibit and explain nature subjects to their
                        pupils. Elnora loved the work, and she needed the money, for every few days
                        some matter of expense arose that she had not expected.</p>
                    <p>From the first week she had been received and invited with the crowd of girls
                        in her class, and it was their custom in passing through the business part
                        of the city to stop at the confectioners&apos; and take turns in
                        treating to expensive candies, ice cream sodas, hot chocolate, or whatever
                        they fancied. When first Elnora was asked she accepted without
                        understanding. The second time she went because she seldom had tasted these
                        things, and they were so delicious she could not resist. After that she went
                        because she knew all about it, and had decided to go.</p>
                    <p>She had spent a half-hour on the log by the trail in deep thought and had
                        arrived at her conclusions. She worked harder than usual for the next week,
                        but she seemed to thrive on work. It was October and the red leaves were
                        falling when her first time came to treat. As the crowd flocked down the
                        broad walk that night Elnora called &quot;Girls, it&apos;s my treat
                        to-night! Come on!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She led the way through the city to the grocery they patronized when they had
                        a small spread, and entering came out with a basket, which she carried to
                        the bridge on her home road. There she arranged the girls in two rows on the
                        cement abutments and opening her basket she gravely offered each girl an
                        exquisite little basket of bark, lined with red leaves, in one end of which
                            <pb id="VAA2373-179" n="170"/> nestled a juicy big red apple and in the
                        other a spicy doughnut not an hour from Margaret Sinton&apos;s frying
                        basket.</p>
                    <p>Another time she offered big balls of popped corn stuck together with maple
                        sugar, and liberally sprinkled with beechnut kernels. Again it was hickory
                        nut kernels glazed with sugar, another time maple candy, and once a basket
                        of warm pumpkin pies. She never made any apology, or offered any excuse. She
                        simply gave what she could afford, and the change was as welcome to those
                        city girls, accustomed to sodas and French candy as were these same things
                        to Elnora surfeited on pop-corn and pie. In her room was a little slip
                        containing a record of the number of weeks in the school year, the times it
                        would be her turn to treat and the dates on which such occasions would fall,
                        with a number of suggestions by each. Once the girls almost fought over a
                        basket lined with yellow leaves, and filled with fat, very ripe red haws. In
                        late October there was a riot over one which was lined with red leaves and
                        contained big fragrant pawpaws frost-bitten to a perfect degree. Then hazel
                        nuts were ripe, and once they served. One day Elnora at her wits&apos;
                        end, explained to her mother that the girls had given her things and she
                        wanted to treat them. Mrs. Comstock, with characteristic stubbornness, had
                        said she would leave a basket at the grocery for her, but firmly declined to
                        say what would be in it. All day Elnora struggled to keep her mind on her
                        books. For hours she wavered in tense uncertainty. <pb id="VAA2373-180"
                            n="171"/> What would her mother do? Should she take the girls to the
                        confectioner&apos;s that night or risk the basket? Mrs. Comstock could
                        make delicious things to eat, but would she?</p>
                    <p>As they left the building Elnora made a final rapid mental calculation. She
                        could not see her way clear to a decent treat for ten people for less than
                        two dollars. and if the basket was nice, then the money would be wasted. She
                        decided to risk it. As they went to the bridge the girls were betting on
                        what the treat would be, and crowding near Elnora like spoiled small
                        children. Elnora set down the basket.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Girls,&quot; she said, &quot;I don&apos;t know what
                        this is myself, so all of us are going to be surprised. Here goes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She lifted the cover and perfumes from the land of spices rolled up. In one
                        end of the basket lay ten enormous sugar cakes the tops of which had been
                        liberally dotted with circles cut from stick candy. The candy had melted in
                        baking and made small transparent wells of waxy sweetness and in the centre
                        of each cake was a fat turtle made from a raisin with cloves for head and
                        feet. The remainder of the basket was filled with big spiced pears that
                        could be held by their stems while they were beaten. The girls shrieked and
                        attacked the cookies, and of all the treats Elnora offered perhaps none was
                        quite so long remembered as that.</p>
                    <p>When Elnora took her basket, placed her books in it, and started home, all
                        the girls went with her as far as the fence where she crossed the field to
                        the swamp. When <pb id="VAA2373-181" n="172"/> they parted they kissed her
                        good-bye. Elnora was a happy girl as she hurried home to thank her mother.
                        She was happy over her books that night, and happy all the way to school the
                        next morning.</p>
                    <p>When the music swelled from the orchestra her heart almost broke with
                        throbbing joy. For music always had affected her strangely, and since she
                        had been comfortable enough in her surroundings to notice things, she had
                        listened to every note to find what it was that literally hurt her heart and
                        at last she knew. It was the talking of the violins. They were human voices,
                        and they spoke a language Elnora understood. It seemed to her that she must
                        climb up on the stage, take the instruments from the fingers of the players
                        and make them speak what was in her heart. She fairly prayed to get hold of
                        one, if only for a second.</p>
                    <p>That night she said to her mother, &quot;I am perfectly crazy for a
                        violin. I am sure I could play one, sure as I live. Did anyone&quot;
                        Elnora never completed that sentence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hush!&quot; thundered Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Be quiet! Never
                        mention those things before me againnever as long as you live! I loath them!
                        They are a snare of the very devil himself! They were made to lure men and
                        women from their homes and their honour. If ever I see you with one in your
                        fingers I will smash it in pieces.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Naturally Elnora hushed, but she thought of nothing else after she had done
                        justice to her lessons. At last <pb id="VAA2373-182" n="173"/> there came a
                        day when for some reason the leader of the orchestra left his violin on the
                        grand piano. That morning Elnora made her first mistake in algebra. At noon,
                        as soon as the great building was empty, she slipped into the auditorium,
                        found the side door which led to the stage, and going through the
                        musicians&apos; entrance she took the violin. She carried it back into
                        the little side room where the orchestra assembled, closed all the doors,
                        opened the case and lifted out the instrument.</p>
                    <p>She laid it on her breast, dropped her chin on it and drew the bow softly
                        across the strings. One after another she tested the open notes. They
                        reminded her of things. Gradually her stroke ceased to tremble and she drew
                        the bow firmly. Then her fingers began to fall and softly, slowly she
                        searched up and down those strings for sounds she knew. Standing in the
                        middle of the floor, she tried over and over. It seemed scarcely a minute
                        before the hall was filled with the sounds of hurrying feet, and she was
                        forced to put away the violin and go to her classes. Of food she never
                        thought until she noticed how heavy her lunch box was on the way home, so
                        she sat on the log by the swamp and remedied that. The next day she prayed
                        that the violin would be left again, but her petition was not answered.</p>
                    <p>That night when she returned from school she made an excuse to go down to see
                        Billy. He was engage in hulling walnuts by driving them through holes in a
                        board. His hands were protected by a pair of Margaret&apos;s <pb
                            id="VAA2373-183" n="174"/> old gloves, but he had speckled his face
                        generously. He looked well, and greeted Elnora hilariously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me an&apos; the squirrels are laying up our winter
                        stores,&quot; he shouted. &quot; &apos;Cos the cold is coming,
                        an&apos; the snow an&apos; if we have any nuts we have to fix
                        &apos;em now. But I&apos;m ahead, &apos;cos Uncle Wesley made me
                        this board, and I can hull a big pile while the old squirrel does only
                        &apos;ist one with his teeth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora picked him up and kissed him. &quot;Billy, are you
                        happy?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and so&apos;s Snap,&quot; answered Billy.
                        &quot;You ought to see him make the dirt fly when he gets after a
                        chipmunk. I bet you he could dig up pa, if anybody wanted him to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy!&quot; gasped Margaret as she came out to them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, me and Snap don&apos;t want him up, and I bet you Jimmy
                        and Belle don&apos;t, either. I ain&apos;t been twisty inside once
                        since I been here, and I don&apos;t want to go away, and Snap
                        don&apos;t, either. He told me so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy! That is not true. Dogs can&apos;t talk,&quot;
                        cautioned Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then what makes you open the door when he asks you to?&quot;
                        demanded Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Scratching and whining isn&apos;t talking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyway, it&apos;s the best Snap can talk, and you get up and do
                        things he wants done. Chipmunks can talk too. You ought to hear them dam
                        things holler when Snap gets them!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy! When you want a cooky for supper and I <pb id="VAA2373-184"
                            n="175"/> don&apos;t give it to you it is because you said a wrong
                        word.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, for&quot; Billy clapped his hand over his mouth and
                        stained his face in swipes. &quot;Well, foranything! Did I go
                        an&apos; forget again! The cookies will get all hard, won&apos;t
                        they? I bet you ten dollars I don&apos;t say that any more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He espied Wesley and ran to show him a walnut too big to go through the
                        holes, and Elnora and Margaret went into the house.</p>
                    <p>They talked of many things for a time and then Elnora said suddenly,
                        &quot;Aunt Margaret, I like music.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve noticed that in you all your life,&quot; answered
                        Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If dogs can&apos;t talk, I can make a violin talk,&quot;
                        announced Elnora, and then in amazement watched the face of Margaret Sinton
                        grow pale.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A violin!&quot; she wavered. &quot;Where did you get a
                        violin?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They fairly seemed to speak to me in the orchestra. One day the
                        conductor left his in the auditorium, and I took it, and, Aunt Margaret, I
                        can make it do the wind in the swamp, the birds, and the animals. I can make
                        any sound I ever heard on it. If I had a chance to practise a little, I
                        could make it do the orchestra music, too. I don&apos;t know how I know,
                        but I do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Diddid you ever mention it to your mother?&quot; faltered
                        Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and she seems prejudiced against them. But, <pb
                            id="VAA2373-185" n="176"/> oh, Aunt Margaret, I never felt so about
                        anything, not even going to school. I just feel as if I&apos;d die if I
                        didn&apos;t have one. I could keep it at school, and practise at noon a
                        whole hour. Soon they&apos;d ask me to play in the orchestra. I could
                        keep it in the case and practise in the woods in summer. You&apos;d let
                        me play here over Sunday. Oh, Aunt Margaret, what does one cost? Would it be
                        wicked for me to take of my money and buy a very cheap one? I could play on
                        the least expensive one made.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no you couldn&apos;t! A cheap machine makes cheap music.
                        You got to have a fine fiddle to make it sing. But there&apos;s no sense
                        in your buying one. There isn&apos;t a decent reason on earth why you
                        shouldn&apos;t have your fa&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My father&apos;s!&quot; cried Elnora. She caught Margaret
                        Sinton by the arm. &quot;My father had a violin! He played it.
                        That&apos;s why I can! Where is it! Is it in our house? Is it in
                        mother&apos;s room?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora!&quot; panted Margaret. &quot;Your mother will kill
                        me! She always hated it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother dearly loves music,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not when it took the man she loved away from her to make
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is my father&apos;s violin?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve never seen a picture of my father. I&apos;ve
                        never heard his name mentioned. I&apos;ve never had a scrap that
                        belonged to him. Was he my father, or am I a charity child like Billy, and
                        so she hates me?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-186" n="177"/>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s got good pictures of him. Seems she just
                        can&apos;t bear to hear him talked about. Of course, he was your father.
                        They lived right there when you were born. She don&apos;t dislike you,
                        she just tries to make herself think she does. There&apos;s no sense in
                        the world in you not having his violin. I&apos;ve a great notion</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has she got it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I&apos;ve never heard her mention it. It was not at home
                        when hewhen he died.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know where it is?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I&apos;m the only person on earth who does, except the one
                        who has it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t tell you, but I will see if they have it yet, and
                        get it if I can. But, if your mother finds it out she will never forgive
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t help it,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I want
                        that violin. I want it now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll go to-morrow, and get it if it has not been
                        destroyed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Destroyed! Oh, Aunt Margaret! Would anyone dare?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hardly think so. It was a good instrument. He played it like a
                        master.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me!&quot; breathed Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;His hair was red and curled more than yours, and his eyes were
                        blue. He was tall, slim, and the very imp of mischief. He joked and teased
                        all day until he picked <pb id="VAA2373-187" n="178"/> up that violin. Then
                        his head bent over it, and his eyes got big and earnest. He seemed to listen
                        as if he first heard the notes, and then copied them. Sometimes he drew the
                        bow trembly, like he wasn&apos;t sure it was right, and he might have to
                        try again. He could almost drive you crazy when he wanted to, and no man
                        that ever lived could make you dance as he could. He made it all up as he
                        went. He seemed to listen for his dancing music, too. It appeared to come to
                        him; he&apos;d begin to play and you had to keep time or die. You
                        couldn&apos;t be still; he loved to sweep a crowd around with that bow
                        of his. I think it was the thing you call inspiration. I can see him now,
                        his handsome head bent, his cheeks red, his eyes snapping, and that bow
                        going across the strings, and driving us like sheep. He always kept his body
                        swinging, and he loved to play. He often slighted his work shamefully, and
                        sometimes her a little; that is why she hated itElnora, what are you making
                        me do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The tears were rolling down Elnora&apos;s cheeks. &quot;Oh, Aunt
                        Margaret,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;Why haven&apos;t you told me
                        about him sooner? I feel as if you had given my father to me living, so that
                        I could touch him. I can see him, too! Why didn&apos;t you ever tell me
                        before? Go on! Go on!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t, Elnora! I&apos;m scared to death! I never
                        meant to say anything. If I hadn&apos;t promised her not to talk of him
                        to you she wouldn&apos;t have let you come here. She made me swear
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-188" n="179"/>
                    <p>&quot;But why? Why? Was he a shame? Was he disgraced?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe it was that unjust feeling that took possession of her when
                        she couldn&apos;t help him from the swamp. She had to blame some one, or
                        go crazy, so she took it out on you. At times, those first ten years, if I
                        had talked to you, and you had repeated anything to her, she might have
                        struck you too hard. She was not master of herself. You must be patient with
                        her, Elnora. God only knows what she has gone through, but I think she is a
                        little better lately.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So do I,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;She seems more interested
                        in my clothes, and she fixes me such delicious lunches that the girls bring
                        fine candies and cake and beg to trade. I gave half my lunch for a box of
                        candy one day, brought it home to her, and told her. Since, she has wanted
                        me to carry a market basket and treat the crowd every day, she was so
                        pleased. Life has been too monotonous for her. I think she enjoys even the
                        little change made by my going and coming. She sits up half the night to
                        read the library books I bring, but she is so stubborn she won&apos;t
                        even admit that she touches them. Tell me more about my father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait until I see if I can get the violin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So Elnora went home in suspense, and that night she added to her prayers,
                        &quot;Dear Lord, be merciful to my father, and, oh, do help Aunt
                        Margaret to get his violin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley and Billy came in to supper tired and hungry. Billy ate heartily, but
                        his eyes often rested on a plate of <pb id="VAA2373-189" n="180"/> tempting
                        cookies, and when Wesley offered them to the boy he reached for one.
                        Margaret was compelled to explain that cookies were forbidden that night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot; said Wesley. &quot;Wrong words been coming
                        again. Oh, Billy, I do wish you could remember! I can&apos;t sit and eat
                        cookies before a little boy who has none. I&apos;ll have to put mine
                        back, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy&apos;s face was a puzzle. It twisted in despair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, go on!&quot; he said gruffly, but his chin was jumping, for
                        Wesley was his idol.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t do it,&quot; said Wesley. &quot;It would
                        choke me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy turned to Margaret. &quot;You make him,&quot; he appealed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He can&apos;t, Billy,&quot; said Margaret. &quot;I know
                        how he feels. You see, I can&apos;t myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then Billy slid from his chair, ran to the couch, buried his face in the
                        pillow and cried heart-brokenly. Wesley hurried to the barn, and Margaret to
                        the kitchen. When the dishes were almost washed Billy slipped from the back
                        door.</p>
                    <p>Wesley piling hay into the mangers heard a sound behind him and inquired,
                        &quot;That you, Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Billy, &quot;and it&apos;s all so
                        dark you can&apos;t see me now, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, mighty near,&quot; answered Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you stoop down and open your mouth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton had shared bites of apple and nuts for weeks, for Billy had not
                        learned how to eat anything without dividing with Jimmy and Belle. Since he
                        was separated <pb id="VAA2373-190" n="181"/> from them, he shared with
                        Wesley and Margaret. So he bent over the small figure and received an
                        instalment of cooky that almost choked him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now you can eat it!&quot; shouted Billy in delight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all dark! I can&apos;t see what you&apos;re
                        doing &apos;t all!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley picked up the small figure and set the boy on the back of a horse to
                        bring his face level so that they could talk as men. He never towered from
                        his height above Billy, but always lifted the little soul when important
                        matters were to be discussed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now what a dandy scheme,&quot; he commented. &quot;Did you
                        and Aunt Margaret fix it up?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. She ain&apos;t had hers yet. But I got one for her. Ist as
                        soon as you eat yours, I am going to take hers, and feed her first time I
                        find her in the dark.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, Billy, where did you get the cookies? You know Aunt Margaret
                        said you were not to have any.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ist took them,&quot; said Billy, &quot;I didn&apos;t
                        take them for me. I ist took them for you and her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley swallowed hard and thought fast. In the warm darkness of the barn the
                        horses crunched their corn, a rat gnawed at a corner of the granary, and
                        among the rafters the white pigeon cooed a soft sleepy note to his dusky
                        mate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;DiddidI steal?&quot; wavered Billy through the darkness.</p>
                    <p>Wesley&apos;s big hands closed until he almost hurt the boy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot; be said vehemently. &quot;That is too big a word.
                        You just made a mistake. You were trying to be a fine <pb id="VAA2373-191"
                            n="182"/> little man, but you went at it the wrong way. You only made a
                        mistake. All of us do that, Billy. The world grows that way. When we make
                        mistakes we can see them; that teaches us to be more careful the next time,
                        and so we learn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How wouldn&apos;t it be a mistake?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you had told Aunt Margaret what you wanted to do, and asked her
                        for the cookies she would have given them to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I was &apos;fraid she wouldn&apos;t, and you ist had to
                        have it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not if it was wrong for me to have it, Billy. I don&apos;t want
                        it that much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Must I take it back?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think hard, and decide yourself,&quot; suggested Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lift me down,&quot; said Billy, after a silence. &quot;I
                        got to put this in the jar, and tell her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley set the boy on the floor, but as he did so he paused one second and
                        strained him close to his breast.</p>
                    <p>Margaret sat in her chair sewing, Billy slipped in and crept up beside her.
                        The little face was lined with tragedy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Billy, whatever is the matter?&quot; she cried as she
                        dropped her sewing and held out her arms. Billy stood back. He gripped his
                        little fists tight and squared his shoulders. &quot;I got to be shut up
                        in the closet,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Billy! What an unlucky day! What have you done now?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-192" n="183"/>
                    <p>&quot;I stold!&quot; gulped Billy. &quot;He said it was ist a
                        mistake, but it was worser &apos;an that. I took something you told me I
                        wasn&apos;t to have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stole!&quot; Margaret was in despair. &quot;What,
                        Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cookies!&quot; answered Billy in equal trouble.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy!&quot; wailed Margaret. &quot;How could
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was for him and you,&quot; sobbed Billy. &quot;He said
                        he couldn&apos;t eat it &apos;fore me, but out in the barn
                        it&apos;s all dark and I couldn&apos;t see. I thought maybe he could
                        there. Then we might put out the light and you could have yours. He said I
                        only made it worse, &apos;cos I mustn&apos;t take things, and I know
                        I mustn&apos;t, so I got to go in the closet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret gazed at him helplessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you hold me tight a little bit first? He did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret opened her arms and Billy rushed in and clung to her a few seconds,
                        with all the force of his being, then he slipped to the floor and marched to
                        the closet. Margaret opened the door. Billy gave one glance at the light,
                        clinched his fists and walking inside climbed on a box. Margaret shut her
                        eyes and closed the door.</p>
                    <p>Then she sat and listened. Was the air pure enough? Possibly he might
                        smother. She had read something once. Was it very dark? What if there should
                        be a mouse in the closet and it should run across his foot and frighten him
                        into spasms. Some-where she had heardMargaret leaned forward with tense face
                        and listened. Something dreadful <pb id="VAA2373-193" n="184"/> might
                        happen. She could bear it no longer. She arose hurriedly and opened the
                        door. Billy was drawn up on the box in a little heap, and he lifted a
                        disapproving face to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shut that door!&quot; he said. &quot;I ain&apos;t been
                        in here near long enough yet!&quot;</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> next night Elnora hurried to Sinton&apos;s. She
                        threw open the back door and searched Margaret&apos;s face with anxious
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You got it!&quot; panted Elnora. &quot;You got it! I can
                        see by your face that you did. Oh, give it to me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I got it, honey, I got it all right, but don&apos;t be so
                        fast. You can&apos;t have it before Saturday. It had been kept in such a
                        damp place it needed glueing, it had to have strings, and a key was gone. I
                        knew how much you wanted it, so I sent Wesley right to town with it. They
                        said they could fix it good as new, but it should be varnished, and that it
                        would take several days for the glue to set. You can have it
                        Saturday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You found it where you thought it was? You know it&apos;s
                        his?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it was just where I thought, and it&apos;s the same violin
                        I&apos;ve seen him play hundreds of times. It&apos;s all right, only
                        laying so long it needs fixing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Aunt Margaret! Can I ever wait?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It does seem a long time, but how could I help it? <pb
                            id="VAA2373-195" n="186"/> You couldn&apos;t do anything with it as
                        it was. You see, it had been hidden away in a garret, and it needed cleaning
                        and drying to make it fit to play again. You can have it Saturday
                        sure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Saturday morning?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He just said Saturday. But Elnora, you&apos;ve got to promise
                        me that you will leave it here, or in town, and not let your mother get a
                        hint of it. I don&apos;t know what she&apos;d do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Uncle Wesley can bring it here until Monday. Then I will take it to
                        school so that I can practise at noon. Oh, I don&apos;t know how to
                        thank you. And there&apos;s more than the violin for which to be
                        thankful. You&apos;ve given me my father. Last night I saw him plain as
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora you were dreaming! You couldn&apos;t have seen
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know I was dreaming, but I saw him. I saw him so closely that a
                        tiny white scar at the corner of his eyebrow showed. I was just reaching out
                        to touch him when he disappeared.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who told you there was a scar on his forehead?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No one ever did in all my life. I saw it last night just as he went
                        down. And, oh, Aunt Margaret! I saw what she did, and I heard his cries! No
                        matter what she does, I don&apos;t believe I ever can be angry with her
                        again. Her heart is broken, and she can&apos;t help it. Oh, it was
                        terrible, but I am glad I saw it. Now, I will always understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what to make of that,&quot; said
                        Margaret, <pb id="VAA2373-196" n="187"/> &quot;I don&apos;t believe
                        in such stuff at all, but you couldn&apos;t make it up, for you
                        didn&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I only know that I played the violin last night, as he played it,
                        and while I played he came through the woods from the direction of
                        Carney&apos;s. It was summer and all the flowers were in bloom. He wore
                        gray trousers and a blue shirt, his head was bare, and his face was
                        beautiful. I could almost touch him when he sank.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret Sinton stood perplexed. &quot;Well, I don&apos;t know what
                        to think of that!&quot; she ejaculated. &quot;I was next to the last
                        person who saw him before he was drowned. It was late on a June afternoon,
                        and he was dressed as you describe. He was bareheaded because he had found a
                        quail&apos;s nest before the bird began to brood, and he gathered the
                        eggs in his hat and left it in a fence corner to get on his way home; they
                        found it afterward.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was he coming from Carney&apos;s?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was on that side of the quagmire. Why he ever skirted it so
                        close as to get caught is a mystery you will have to dream out. I never
                        could understand it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was he doing something he didn&apos;t want my mother to
                        know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because if he was, he might have cut close the swamp so he
                        couldn&apos;t be seen from the garden. You know, the whole path straight
                        to the pool where he sank can be seen from our back door. It&apos;s firm
                        on our side. The danger is on the north and east. If he didn&apos;t want
                            <pb id="VAA2373-197" n="188"/> mother to know he might have tried to
                        pass on either of those sides and gone too close. Was he in a
                        hurry?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, he was,&quot; said Margaret. &quot;He had been away
                        longer than he expected, and he almost ran when he started home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And he&apos;d left his violin somewhere that you knew, and you
                        went and got it. I&apos;ll wager he was going to play, and
                        didn&apos;t want mother to find it out!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wouldn&apos;t make any difference to you if you knew every
                        little thing, so quit thinking about it, and just be glad you are to have
                        what he loved best of anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s true, and I must hurry home, or I&apos;ll have
                        to be cutting too close the swamp myself. I am dread-fully late.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora sprang up and ran down the road, but when she was near the cabin she
                        climbed the fence, crossed the open woods pasture diagonally and entered at
                        the back garden gate. As she often came that way when she had been looking
                        for cocoons her mother asked no questions.</p>
                    <p>Elnora lived by the minute until Saturday, when, contrary to his usual
                        custom, Sinton went to town in the forenoon, taking her along to buy some
                        groceries. Sinton drove straight to the music store, and asked for the
                        violin he had left to be mended.</p>
                    <p>In its new coat of varnish, with new keys and strings, it looked greatly like
                        any other violin to Sinton, but to Elnora it was the most beautiful
                        instrument ever made, and a priceless treasure. She held it in her arms,
                        touched <pb id="VAA2373-198" n="189"/> the strings softly and then she drew
                        the bow across them in whispering measure. She had no time to think what a
                        remarkably good bow it was for sixteen years&apos; disuse. The tan
                        leather case might have impressed her as being in fine condition also, had
                        she been in a state to question anything. She did remember to ask for the
                        bill and she was gravely presented with a slip calling for four strings, one
                        key, and a coat of varnish, total, one dollar fifty. It seemed to Elnora she
                        never could put the precious instrument in the case and start home. Wesley
                        left her in the music store where the proprietor showed her all he could
                        about tuning, and gave her several beginners&apos; sheets of notes and
                        scales. She carried the violin in her arms as far as the crossroads at the
                        corner of their land, then reluctantly put it under the carriage seat.</p>
                    <p>As soon as her work was done she ran down to Sintons&apos; and began to
                        play, and on Monday the violin went to school with her. She made
                        arrangements with the superintendent to leave it in his office and scarcely
                        took time for her food at noon, she was so eager to practise. Often one of
                        the girls asked her to stay in town all night for some lecture or
                        entertainment. She could take the violin with her, practise, and secure
                        help. Her skill was so great that the leader of the orchestra offered to
                        give her lessons if she would play to pay for them, so her progress was
                        rapid in technical work. But from the first day the instrument became hers,
                        with perfect faith that she could play as her father did, she spent half her
                        practice <pb id="VAA2373-199" n="190"/> time in imitating the sounds of all
                        outdoors and improvising the songs her happy heart sang in those days.</p>
                    <p>So the first year went, and the second and third were a repetition; but the
                        fourth was different, for that was the close of the course, ending with
                        graduation and all its attendant ceremonies and expenses. To Elnora these
                        appeared mountain high. She had hoarded every cent, thinking twice before
                        she parted with a penny, but teaching natural history in the grades had
                        taken time from her studies in school which must be made up outside. She was
                        a conscientious student, ranking first in most of her classes, and standing
                        high in all branches. Her interest in her violin had grown with the years.
                        She went to school early and practised a half-hour in the little room off
                        the stage, while the orchestra gathered. She put in a full hour at noon, and
                        remained another half hour at night. She carried the violin to
                        Sinton&apos;s on Saturday and practised all the time she could there,
                        while Margaret watched the road to see that Mrs. Comstock was not coming.
                        She had become so skilful that it was a delight to hear her play the music
                        of any composer, but when she played her own, that was joy inexpressible,
                        for then the wind blew, the water rippled, the Limberlost sang her songs of
                        sunshine, shadow, black storm, and white night.</p>
                    <p>Since her dream Elnora had regarded her mother with peculiar tenderness. The
                        girl realized, in a measure, what had happened. She avoided anything that
                        possibly could stir bitter memories or draw deeper a line <pb
                            id="VAA2373-200" n="191"/> on the hard, white face. This cost many
                        sacrifices, much work, and sometimes delayed progress, but the horror of
                        that awful dream remained with Elnora. She worked her way cheerfully, doing
                        all she could to interest her mother in things that happened in school, in
                        the city, and by carrying books that were interesting from the public
                        libraries.</p>
                    <p>Three years had changed Elnora from the girl of sixteen to the very verge of
                        womanhood. She had grown tall, round, and her face had the loveliness of
                        perfect complexion, beautiful eyes and hair and an added touch from within
                        that might have been called comprehension. It was a compound of
                        self-reliance, hard knocks, heart hunger, unceasing work, and generosity.
                        There was no form of suffering with which the girl could not sympathize, no
                        work she was afraid to attempt, no subject she had investigated she did not
                        understand. These things combined to produce a breadth and depth of
                        character altogether unusual. She was so absorbed in her classes and her
                        music that she had not been able to gather specimens as usual. When she
                        realized this and hunted assiduously, she soon found that changing natural
                        conditions had affected such work. Men all around were clearing available
                        land. The trees fell wherever corn would grow. The swamp was broken by
                        several gravel roads, dotted in places around the edge with little frame
                        houses, and the machinery of oil wells; one especially low place around the
                        region of Freckles&apos;s room was nearly all that remained of the
                        original. <pb id="VAA2373-201" n="192"/> Wherever the trees fell the
                        moisture dried, the creeks ceased to flow, the river ran low, and at times
                        the bed was dry. With unbroken sweep the winds of the west came, gathering
                        force with every mile and howled and raved; threatening to tear the shingles
                        from the roof, blowing the surface from the soil in clouds of fine dust and
                        rapidly changing everything. From coming in with two or three dozen rare
                        moths in a day, in three years&apos; time Elnora had grown to be
                        delighted with finding two or three. Big pursy caterpillars could not be
                        picked from their favourite bushes, when there were no bushes. Dragon flies
                        would not hover over dry places, and butterflies became scarce in proportion
                        to the flowers, while no land yields over three crops of Indian relics.</p>
                    <p>All the time the expense of books, clothing and incidentals had continued.
                        Elnora added to her bank account whenever she could, and drew out when she
                        was compelled, but she omitted the important feature of calling for a
                        balance. So, one early spring morning in the last quarter of the fourth
                        year, she almost fainted when she learned that all her funds were gone.
                        Commencement with its extra expense was coming, she had no money, and very
                        few cocoons to open in June, which would be too late. She had one collection
                        for the Bird Woman complete to a pair of Imperialis moths, and that was her
                        only asset. On the day she added these big yellow Emperors she would get a
                        check for three hundred dollars, but she would not get it until these
                        specimens <pb id="VAA2373-202" n="193"/> were secured. She remembered that
                        she never had found an Emperor before June.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, that sum was for her first year in college. Then she would be of
                        age, and she meant to sell enough of her share of her father&apos;s land
                        to finish. She knew her mother would oppose her bitterly in that, for Mrs.
                        Comstock had clung to every acre and tree that belonged to her husband. Her
                        land was almost complete forest where her neighbours owned cleared farms,
                        dotted with wells that every hour sucked oil from beneath her holdings, but
                        she was too absorbed in the grief she nursed to know or care. The Brushwood
                        road and the redredging of the great Limberlost ditch had been more than she
                        could pay from her income, and she had trembled before the wicket as she
                        asked the banker if she had funds to pay it, and wondered why he laughed as
                        he assured her she had. For Mrs. Comstock had spent no time on compounding
                        interest, and never added the sums she had been depositing through nearly
                        twenty years. Now she thought her funds were almost gone, and every day she
                        worried over expenses. She could see no reason in going through the forms of
                        graduation when pupils had all in their heads that was required to graduate.
                        Elnora knew she had to have her diploma in order to enter the college she
                        wanted to attend, but she did not dare utter the word, until high school was
                        finished, for, instead of softening as she hoped her mother had begun to do,
                        she seemed to remain very much the same.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-203" n="194"/>
                    <p>When the girl reached the swamp she sat on a log and thought bitterly over
                        the absolute expense she was compelled to meet. Every member of her
                        particular set was having an expensive photograph taken to exchange with the
                        others. Elnora loved these girls and boys, and to say she could not have
                        their pictures to keep was more than she could bear. Each one would give to
                        all the others a handsome graduation present. She knew they would prepare
                        gifts for her whether she could make a present in return or not. Then it was
                        the custom for each graduating class to give a great entertainment and use
                        the funds to present the school with a statue for the entrance hall. Elnora
                        had been cast for and was practising a part in that performance. She was
                        expected to furnish her dress and personal necessities. She had been told
                        that she must have a green dress, and where was it to come from?</p>
                    <p>Every girl of the class would have three beautiful new frocks for
                        Commencement; one for the baccalaureate sermon, another, which could be
                        plainer, for graduation exercises, and a handsome one for the banquet and
                        ball. Elnora faced the past three years and wondered how she could have
                        spent so much money and not kept account of it. She did not realize where it
                        had gone. She did not know what she could do now. She thought over the
                        photographs, and at last settled that question to her satisfaction. She
                        studied longer over the gifts, ten handsome ones there must be, and at last
                        decided she could arrange for them. The green dress came first. <pb
                            id="VAA2373-204" n="195"/> The lights would be dim in the scene, and the
                        setting deep woods. She could manage that. She simply could not have three
                        dresses. She would have to get a very simple one for the sermon and do the
                        best she could for graduation. Whatever she got for that must be made with a
                        guimpe that could be taken out to make it a little more festive for the
                        ball. But where could she get even two pretty dresses?</p>
                    <p>The only hope she could see was to break into the collection of the man from
                        India, sell some moths, and try to replace them in June. But in her soul she
                        knew that never would do. No June ever brought just the things she hoped it
                        would. If she spent the college money she knew she could not replace it. If
                        she did not, the only way was to try for a room in the grades and teach a
                        year. Her work there had been so appreciated that Elnora felt with the
                        recommendation she knew she could get from the superintendent and teachers
                        she could secure a position. She was sure she could pass the examinations
                        easily. She had once gone on Saturday, taken them and secured a licence for
                        a year before she left the Brushwood school.</p>
                    <p>She wanted to start to college when the other girls were going. If she could
                        make the first year alone, she could manage the rest. But make that first
                        year herself, she must. Instead of selling any of her collection, she must
                        hunt as she never before had hunted and find a yellow Emperor. She had to
                        have it, that was all. Also, she had to have those dresses. She thought of
                            <pb id="VAA2373-205" n="196"/> Sinton and dismissed it. She thought of
                        the Bird Woman, and knew she could not tell her. She thought of every way in
                        which she ever had hoped to earn money and realized that with the play,
                        committee meetings, practising, and final examinations she scarcely had time
                        to live, much less to do more than the work required for her pictures and
                        gifts. Again, Elnora was in trouble, and this time it seemed the worst of
                        all.</p>
                    <p>It was dark when she arose and went home.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother,&quot; she said, &quot;I have a piece of news that
                        is decidedly not cheerful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then keep it to yourself!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I
                        think I have enough to bear without a great girl like you piling trouble on
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My money is all gone!&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, did you think it would last forever? It&apos;s been a
                        marvel to me that it&apos;s held out as well as it has, the way
                        you&apos;ve dressed and gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve &apos;spent any that I was
                        not compelled to,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I&apos;ve dressed on
                        just as little as I possibly could to keep going. I am heartsick. I thought
                        I had over fifty dollars to put me through Commencement, but they tell me
                        it&apos;s all gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fifty dollars! To put you through Commencement! Well, what on earth
                        are you proposing to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The same as the rest of them, in the very cheapest way
                        possible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what might that be?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora omitted the photographs, the gifts and the <pb id="VAA2373-206"
                            n="197"/> play. She told only of the sermon, graduation exercises, and
                        the ball.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I wouldn&apos;t trouble myself over that,&quot;
                        sniffed Mrs. Comstock. &quot;If you want to go to a sermon, put on the
                        dress you always use for meeting. If you need white for the exercises wear
                        the new dress you got last spring. As for the ball, the best thing for you
                        to do is to stay a mile away from such folly. In my opinion you&apos;d
                        best bring home your books, and quit right now. You can&apos;t be fixed
                        like the rest of them, don&apos;t be so foolish as to run into it. Just
                        stay here and let these last few days go. You can&apos;t learn enough
                        more to be of any account.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, mother,&quot; gasped Elnora. &quot;You don&apos;t
                        under-stand!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, I do!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I
                        under-stand perfectly. So long as the money lasted, you held up your head,
                        and went sailing without even explaining how you got it from the stuff you
                        gathered. Goodness knows I couldn&apos;t see. But now it&apos;s
                        gone, you come whining to me. What have I got? Have you forgot that the
                        ditch and the road completely strapped me? I haven&apos;t any money.
                        There&apos;s nothing for you to do but get out of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t!&quot; said Elnora desperately.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve gone on too long. It would make a break in
                        everything. They wouldn&apos;t let me have my diploma!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the difference? You&apos;ve got the stuff in
                        your head. I wouldn&apos;t give a rap for a scrap of paper. That
                        don&apos;t mean anything!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-207" n="198"/>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;ve worked four years for it, and I can&apos;t
                        enterI ought to have it to help me get a school, when I want to teach. If I
                        don&apos;t have my grades to show, people will think I quit because I
                        couldn&apos;t pass my examinations. I must have my diploma!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then get it!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The only way is to graduate with the rest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, graduate if you are bound to!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I can&apos;t, unless I have things enough like the others,
                        that I don&apos;t look as I did that first day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, please remember I didn&apos;t get you into this, and I
                        can&apos;t get you out. You are set on having your wn way. Go on, and
                        have it, and see how you like it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora went upstairs and did not come down again that night, which her mother
                        called pouting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve thought all night,&quot; said the girl at
                        breakfast, &quot;and I can&apos;t see any way but to borrow the
                        money of Uncle Wesley and pay it back from some that the Bird Woman will owe
                        me, when I get one more specimen. But that means that I can&apos;t go
                        tothat I will have to teach this winter, if I can get a city grade or a
                        country school.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just you dare go dinging after Wesley Sinton for money,&quot;
                        cried Mrs. Comstock. &quot;You won&apos;t do any such a
                        thing!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t see any other way. I&apos;ve got to have the
                        money!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quit, I tell you!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-208" n="199"/>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t quit!I&apos;ve gone too far!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, let me get your clothes, and you can pay me
                        back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you said you had no money!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe I can borrow some at the bank. Then you can return it when
                        the Bird Woman pays you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I don&apos;t have
                        to have expensive things. Just some kind of a pretty cheap white dress for
                        the sermon, and a white one a little better than I had last summer, for
                        Commencement and the ball. I can use the white gloves and shoes I got myself
                        for last year, and you can get my dress made at the same place you did that
                        one. They have my measurements, and do perfect work. Don&apos;t get
                        expensive things. It will be warm so I can go bareheaded.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she started to school, but was so tired and discouraged she scarcely
                        could walk. Four years&apos; plans going in one day! For she felt that
                        if she did not get started to college that fall she never would. Instead of
                        feeling relieved at her mother&apos;s offer, she was almost too ill to
                        go on. For the thousandth time she groaned, &quot;Oh, why
                        didn&apos;t I keep account of my money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>After that the days went so swiftly she scarcely had time to think, but
                        several trips her mother made to town, and the assurance that everything was
                        all right, satisfied Elnora. She worked very hard to pass good final
                        examinations and perfect herself for the play. For two days she had remained
                        in town with the Bird Woman in order to spend more time practising and at
                        her work.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-209" n="200"/>
                    <p>Often Margaret had asked about her dresses for graduation, and Elnora had
                        replied that they were with a woman in the city who had made her a white
                        dress for last year&apos;s Commencement when she was a junior usher, and
                        they would be all right. So Margaret, Wesley, and Billy concerned themselves
                        over what they would get her for a present. Margaret suggested a beautiful
                        dress. Sinton said that would look to every one as if she needed dresses.
                        The thing was to get a handsome gift like all the rest would have. Billy
                        wanted to present her a five-dollar gold piece to buy music for her violin.
                        He was positive Elnora would like that best of anything.</p>
                    <p>It was toward the close of the term when they drove to town one evening to
                        try to settle this important question. They knew Mrs. Comstock had been
                        alone several days, so they asked her to accompany them. She had been more
                        lonely than she would admit, filled with unusual unrest besides, and so she
                        was glad to go. But before they had driven a mile Billy had told that they
                        were going to buy Elnora a graduation present, and Mrs. Comstock devoutly
                        wished that she had remained at home. She was prepared when Billy asked,
                        &quot;Aunt Kate, what are you going to give Elnora when she
                        graduates?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Plenty to eat, a good bed to sleep in, and do all the work while
                        she trollops,&quot; answered Mrs. Comstock dryly.</p>
                    <p>Billy reflected. &quot;I guess all of them have got that,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2373-210" n="201"/> he said. &quot;I mean a present you buy
                        at the store, like Christmas?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is only rich folks that buy presents at stores,&quot;
                        replied Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I can&apos;t afford it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we ain&apos;t rich,&quot; he said, &quot;but we
                        are going to buy Elnora something as fine as the rest of them have if we
                        sell a corner of the farm. Uncle Wesley said so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A fool and his land is soon parted,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock
                        tersely. Wesley and Billy laughed, but Margaret did not enjoy the remark.</p>
                    <p>While they were searching the stores for something on which all of them could
                        decide, and Margaret was holding Billy to keep him from saying anything
                        before Mrs. Comstock about the music on which he was determined; Mr.
                        Brownlee met Wesley and stopped to shake hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see your boy came out finely,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t allow any boy anywhere to be finer than
                        Billy,&quot; said Sinton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess you don&apos;t allow any girl to surpass
                        Elnora,&quot; said Mr. Brownlee. &quot;She comes home with Ellen
                        often, and my wife and I love her. Ellen says she is great in her part
                        to-night. Best thing in the whole play! Of course, you are in to see it! If
                        you haven&apos;t reserved seats, you&apos;d best start pretty soon,
                        for the high school auditorium only seats a thousand. It&apos;s always
                        jammed at these home-talent plays. All of us want to see how our children
                        perform.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, yes, of course,&quot; said the bewildered Sinton. <pb
                            id="VAA2373-211" n="202"/> Then he hurried to Margaret.
                        &quot;Say,&quot; he said, &quot;there is going to be a play at
                        the high school to-night; and Elnora is in it. Why hasn&apos;t she told
                        us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Margaret, &quot;but
                        I&apos;m going.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So am I,&quot; said Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me, too!&quot; said Wesley, &quot;unless you think for some
                        reason she don&apos;t want us. Looks like she would have told us if she
                        had. I&apos;m going to ask her mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, that&apos;s what&apos;s she&apos;s been staying in
                        town for,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;It&apos;s some sort of
                        a swindle to raise money for her class to buy some silly thing to stick up
                        in the school house hall to remember them by. I don&apos;t know whether
                        it&apos;s now or next week, but there&apos;s something of the kind
                        to be done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s to-night,&quot; said Wesley, &quot;and
                        we are going. It&apos;s my treat, and we&apos;ve got to hurry or we
                        won&apos;t get in. There&apos;s reserved seats, and we have none, so
                        it&apos;s the gallery for us, but I don&apos;t care so I get to take
                        one good peep at Elnora.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;S&apos;pose she plays?&quot; whispered Margaret in his ear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, tush! She couldn&apos;t!&quot; said Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, she&apos;s been doing it three years in the orchestra,
                        and working like a slave at it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, well that&apos;s different. She&apos;s in the play
                        tonight. Brownlee told me so. Come on, quick! We&apos;ll drive and hitch
                        closest place we can find to the building.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret went in the excitement of the moment, but she was troubled.</p>
                    <p>When they reached the building Wesley tied the team <pb id="VAA2373-212"
                            n="203"/> to a railing and Billy sprang out to help Margaret. Mrs.
                        Comstock sat still.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, Kate,&quot; said Wesley, reaching his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not going anywhere,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock,
                        settling comfortably back against the cushions.</p>
                    <p>All of them begged and pleaded, but it was no use. Not an inch would Mrs.
                        Comstock budge. The night was warm and the carriage comfortable, the horses
                        were securely hitched. She did not care to see what idiotic thing a pack of
                        school children were doing, she would wait until the Sintons returned.
                        Wesley told her it might be two hours, and she said she did not care if it
                        was four, so they left her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you ever see such?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cookies!&quot; cried Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Such blamed stubbornness in all your life?&quot; demanded
                        Sinton. &quot;Won&apos;t come to see as fine a girl as Elnora in a
                        stage performance. Why, I wouldn&apos;t miss if for fifty
                        dollars!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think it&apos;s a blessing she didn&apos;t,&quot;
                        said Margaret placidly. &quot;I begged unusually hard so she
                        wouldn&apos;t. I&apos;m scared of my life for fear Elnora will
                        play.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They found seats near the door where they could see fairly well. Billy stood
                        at the back of the hall and had a good view. By and by, a great volume of
                        sound welled from the orchestra, but Elnora was not playing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Told you so!&quot; said Sinton. &quot;Got a notion to go
                        out and see if Kate won&apos;t come now. She can take my seat, and
                        I&apos;ll stand with Billy.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-213" n="204"/>
                    <p>&quot;You sit still!&quot; said Margaret emphatically. &quot;This
                        is not over yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So Wesley remained in his seat. The play opened and went on very much like
                        all high school plays have gone for the past fifty years. But Elnora did not
                        appear in any of the scenes.</p>
                    <p>Out in the warm summer night a sour, grim woman nursed an aching heart and
                        tried to justify herself. The effort irritated her intensely. She felt that
                        she could not afford the things that were being done. The old fear of losing
                        the land that she and Robert Comstock had purchased and began to clear, was
                        strong upon her. She was thinking of him, how she needed him, when the
                        orchestra music poured from the open windows near her. She leaned back,
                        closed her eyes and tried to make her mind a blank, to shut out even the
                        music, when the leading violin began a solo. Mrs. Comstock bore it as long
                        as she could, and then slipped from the carriage and fled down the street.</p>
                    <p>She did not know how far she went or how long she stayed, but everything was
                        still, save an occasional raised voice when she wandered back. She stood
                        looking at the building. Slowly she entered the wide gates and followed up
                        the walk. Elnora had been coming here for almost four years. When Mrs.
                        Comstock reached the door she looked inside. The wide hall was lighted with
                        electricity, and the statuary and the decorations of the walls did not seem
                        like pieces of foolishness. The marble looked pure, white, and the <pb
                            id="VAA2373-214" n="205"/> big pictures most interesting. She walked the
                        length of the hall and slowly read the title of the statues and the names of
                        the pupils who had donated them. She speculated on where the piece
                        Elnora&apos;s class would buy could be placed to advantage.</p>
                    <p>Then she wondered if they were having a large enough audience to buy marble.
                        She liked it better than the bronze, but it looked as if it cost more. How
                        white the broad stairway was! Elnora had been climbing those stairs for
                        years and never told her they were marble. Of course, she thought they were
                        wood. Probably the upper hall was even grander than this. She went over to
                        the fountain, took a drink, climbed to the first landing and looked about
                        her, and then without thought to the second. There she came opposite the
                        wide open doors and the entrance to the auditorium packed with people and a
                        crowd standing outside. When they noticed a tall woman with white face and
                        hair and black dress, one by one they stepped a little aside, so that Mrs.
                        Comstock could see the stage. It was covered with curtains, and no one was
                        doing anything. Just as she turned to go a sound so faint that everyone
                        leaned forward and listened, drifted down the auditorium. It was difficult
                        to tell just what it was, after one instant half the audience looked toward
                        the windows, for it seemed only a breath of wind rustling freshly opened
                        leaves, just a hint of stirring air.</p>
                    <p>Then the curtains were swept aside swiftly. The stage had been transformed
                        into a lovely little corner <pb id="VAA2373-215" n="206"/> of creation,
                        where trees and flowers grew and moss carpeted the earth. A soft wind blew
                        and it was the gray of dawn. Suddenly a robin began to sing, then a song
                        sparrow joined him, and then several orioles began talking at once. The
                        light grew stronger, the dew drops trembled, flower perfume began to creep
                        out to the audience; the air moved the branches gently and a rooster crowed.
                        Then all the scene was shaken with a babel of bird notes in which you could
                        hear a cardinal whistling, and a blue finch piping. Back somewhere among the
                        high branches a dove cooed and then a horse neighed shrilly. That set a
                        blackbird crying, &quot;T&apos; check,&quot; and a whole flock
                        answered it. The crows began to caw and a lamb bleated. Then the grosbeaks,
                        chats, and vireos had something to say, the sun rose higher, the light grew
                        stronger and the breeze rustled the treetops loudly; a cow bawled and the
                        whole barnyard answered. The guineas were clucking, the turkey gobbler
                        strutting, the hens calling, the chickens cheeping, the light streamed down
                        straight overhead and the bees began to hum. The air stirred strongly, and
                        off in an unseen field a reaper clacked and rattled through ripening wheat
                        while the driver whistled. An uneasy mare whickered to her colt, the colt
                        answered, and the light began to decline. Miles away a rooster crowed for
                        twilight, and dusk was coming down. Then a catbird and a brown thrush sang
                        against a grosbeak and a hermit thrush. The air was tremulous with heavenly
                        notes, the lights went out in the hall, dusk swept across <pb
                            id="VAA2373-216" n="207"/> the stage, a cricket sang and a katydid
                        answered, and a wood pewee wrung the heart with its lonesome cry. Then a
                        night hawk screamed, a whip-poor-will complained, a belated killdeer swept
                        the sky, and the night wind sang a louder song. A little screech owl tuned
                        up in the distance, a barn owl replied, and a great horned owl drowned both
                        their voices. The moon shone and the scene was warm with mellow light. The
                        bird voices died and soft exquisite melody began to swell and roll. In the
                        centre of the stage, piece by piece the grasses, mosses and leaves dropped
                        from an embankment, the foliage softly blew away, while plainer and plainer
                        came the outlines of a lovely girl figure draped in soft clinging green. In
                        her shower of bright hair a few green leaves and white blossoms clung, and
                        they fell over her robe down to her feet. Her white throat and arms were
                        bare, she leaned forward a little and swayed with the melody, her eyes fast
                        on the clouds above her, her lips parted, a pink tinge of exercise in her
                        cheeks as she drew her bow. She played as only a peculiar chain of
                        circumstances puts it in the power of a very few to play. All nature had
                        grown still, the violin sobbed, sang, danced and quavered on alone, no voice
                        in particular, just the soul of the melody of all nature combined in one
                        great outpouring.</p>
                    <p>At the doorway, a white-faced woman bore it as long as she could and then
                        fell senseless. The men nearest carried her down the hall to the fountain,
                        revived her, and then placed her in the carriage to which she directed them.
                            <pb id="VAA2373-217" n="208"/> The girl played on and never knew. When
                        she finished, the uproar of applause sounded a block down the street, but
                        the half-senseless woman scarcely realized what it meant. Then the girl came
                        to the front of the stage, bowed, and lifting the violin she played her
                        conception of an invitation to dance. Every living soul within sound of her
                        notes strained their nerves to sit still and let only their hearts dance
                        with her. When that began the woman ran toward the country. She never
                        stopped until the carriage overtook her half-way to her cabin. She only said
                        she had grown tired of sitting, and walked on ahead. That night she asked
                        Billy to remain with her and sleep on Elnora&apos;s bed. Then she
                        pitched headlong upon her own, and suffered agony of soul such as she never
                        before had known. The swamp had sent back the soul of her loved dead and put
                        it into the body of the daughter she resented, and it was almost more than
                        she could bear and live.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HAT</hi> was Friday night. Elnora came home Saturday morning
                        and went to work. Mrs. Comstock asked no questions, and the girl only told
                        her that the audience had been large enough to more than pay for the piece
                        of statuary the class had selected for the hall. Then she inquired about her
                        dresses and was told they would be ready for her. She had been invited to go
                        to the Bird Woman&apos;s to prepare for both the sermon and Commencement
                        exercises. Since there was so much practising to do, it had been arranged
                        that she should remain there from the night of the sermon until after she
                        was graduated. If Mrs. Comstock decided to attend she was to drive in with
                        the Sintons. When Elnora begged her to come she said she thought not. She
                        cared nothing about such silliness.</p>
                    <p>It was almost time for Wesley to come to take Elnora to the city when, fresh
                        from her bath, with shining, crisply washed hair, and dressed to her outer
                        garment, she stood with expectant face before her mother and cried,
                        &quot;Now my dress, mother!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-219" n="210"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock was pale as she replied, &quot;It&apos;s on my bed.
                        Help yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora opened the door and stepped into her mother&apos;s room with never
                        a misgiving. Since the night Margaret and Wesley had brought her clothing,
                        when she first started to school, her mother had selected all of her
                        dresses, with Mrs. Sinton&apos;s help made most of them, and Elnora had
                        paid the bills. The white dress of the previous spring was her first made at
                        a dressmaker&apos;s. She had worn that as junior usher at Commencement.
                        But her mother had selected the goods, had it made, and it had fitted
                        perfectly and had been suitable in every way. So with her heart at rest on
                        that point, Elnora hurried to the bed to find only her last
                        summer&apos;s white dress, freshly washed and ironed. For an instant she
                        stared at it, then she picked up the garment, looked at the bed beneath it,
                        and then her gaze slowly swept the room.</p>
                    <p>It was a very unfamiliar room. Perhaps this was the third time she had been
                        in it since she was a very small child. Her eyes ranged over the beautiful
                        walnut dresser, the tall bureau, the big chest, inside which she never had
                        seen, and the row of masculine attire hanging above it. Somewhere a dainty
                        lawn or mull dress simply must be hanging. But it was not. Elnora dropped on
                        the chest because she felt too weak to stand. In less than two hours she
                        must be in the church, at Onabasha. She could not wear a last
                        year&apos;s washed dress. She had nothing else. She leaned against the
                            <pb id="VAA2373-220" n="211"/> wall and her father&apos;s overcoat
                        brushed her face. She caught the folds and clung to it with all her might.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, father! Father!&quot; she moaned. &quot;I need you! I
                        don&apos;t believe you would have done this!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She clung to the coat in dry-eyed agony and tried to think what she could do.
                        At last she opened the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t find my dress,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, as it&apos;s the only one there I shouldn&apos;t
                        think it would be much trouble.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean for me to wear an old washed dress tonight?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a good dress. There isn&apos;t a hole in it!
                        There&apos;s no reason on earth why you shouldn&apos;t wear
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Except that I will not,&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;Didn&apos;t you get me any dress for Commencement,
                        either?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you soil that to-night, I&apos;ve plenty of time to wash it
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton&apos;s voice called from the gate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In a minute,&quot; answered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>She ran upstairs and in an incredibly short time came down wearing one of her
                        gingham school dresses. With a cold, hard face she passed her mother and
                        went into the night. A half hour later Margaret and Billy stopped for Mrs.
                        Comstock with the carriage. She had determined fully that she would not go
                        before they called. With the sound of their voices a sort of horror of being
                        left seized her, so she put on her hat, locked the door and went out to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did Elnora look?&quot; inquired Margaret anxiously.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-221" n="212"/>
                    <p>&quot;Like she always does,&quot; answered Mrs. Comstock curtly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do hope her dresses are as pretty as the rest,&quot; said
                        Margaret. &quot;None of them will have prettier faces or nicer
                        ways.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They just don&apos;t have one-half as pretty faces or one-tenth
                        as nice ways,&quot; boasted Billy, who was wrestling with fractions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you two make me tired!&quot; scoffed Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>Wesley was waiting before the big church to take care of the team. As they
                        stood watching the people enter the building, Mrs. Comstock felt herself
                        growing ill, without knowing why. When they went inside among the lights,
                        saw the flower-decked stage, and the masses of finely dressed people, she
                        grew no better. She could hear Margaret and Billy softly commenting on what
                        was being done.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That first chair in the very front row is
                        Elnora&apos;s,&quot; exulted Billy, &quot;&apos;cos
                        she&apos;s got the highest grades, and so she gets to lead the
                        procession to the platform.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The first chair!&quot; &quot;Lead the procession!&quot;
                        Mrs. Comstock was dumfounded. The notes of the pipe organ began to fill the
                        building in a slow rolling march. Would Elnora lead the procession in a
                        gingham dress? Or would she be absent and her chair vacant on this great
                        occasion? For now, Mrs. Comstock could see that it was a great occasion.
                        Everyone would remember how Elnora had played a few nights before, and they
                            <pb id="VAA2373-222" n="213"/> would miss her and pity her. Pity?
                        Because she had no one to care for her. Because she was worse off than if
                        she had no mother. For the first time in her life, Mrs. Comstock began to
                        study herself as she would appear to others. Every time a junior girl came
                        fluttering down the aisle, leading someone to a seat, and Mrs. Comstock saw
                        a beautiful white dress pass, a wave of positive illness swept over her.
                        What had she done? What would become of Elnora?</p>
                    <p>As Elnora rode to the city, she answered Wesley&apos;s questions in
                        monosyllables so that he thought she was nervous or rehearsing her speech
                        and did not care to talk. Several times the girl tried to tell him and
                        realized that if she said the first word it would bring a torrent of tears.
                        The Bird Woman opened the screen and stared unbelievingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I thought you would be ready; you are so late!&quot; she
                        said. &quot;If you have waited to dress here, we will have to
                        hurry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have nothing to put on,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>In bewilderment the Bird Woman drew her inside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Diddid&quot; she faltered, &quot;did you think you would
                        wear that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I thought I would telephone Ellen that there had been an
                        accident and I could not come. I don&apos;t know yet how to explain.
                        I&apos;m too sick to think. Oh, do you suppose I can get something made
                        by Tuesday, so that I can graduate?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; and you &apos;ll get something on you to-night, so <pb
                            id="VAA2373-223" n="214"/> that you can lead your class, as you have
                        done for four years. Go to my room and take off that gingham, quickly. Anna,
                        drop everything, and come help me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Bird Woman ran to the telephone and called Ellen Brownlee.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora has had an accident. She will be a little late,&quot;
                        she said. &quot;You have got to make them wait. Have them play an extra
                        musical number before the march.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she turned to the maid. &quot;Tell Benson to have the carriage at
                        the gate, just as soon as he can get it there. Then come to my room. Bring
                        the thread box from the sewing room, that roll of wide white ribbon on the
                        cutting table, and gather all the white pins from every dresser in the
                        house. But first come with me a minute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want that trunk with the Swamp Angel&apos;s stuff in it, from
                        the cedar closet,&quot; she panted as they reached the top of the
                        stairs.</p>
                    <p>They hurried down the hall together and dragged the big trunk to the Bird
                        Woman&apos;s room. She opened it and began tossing out white stuff.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How lucky that she left these things!&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;Here are white shoes, gloves, stockings, fans,
                        everything!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am all ready but a dress,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>The Bird Woman began opening closets and pulling out drawers and boxes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I can make it this way,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>She snatched up a creamy lace yoke with long sleeves <pb id="VAA2373-224"
                            n="215"/> that recently had been made for her and held it out. Elnora
                        slipped into it, and the Bird Woman began smoothing out wrinkles and sewing
                        in pins. It fitted very well with a little lapping in the back. Next, from
                        among the Angel&apos;s clothing she caught up a white silk waist with
                        low neck and elbow sleeves, and Elnora put it on. It was large enough, but
                        distressingly short in the waist, for the Angel had worn it at a party when
                        she was sixteen. The Bird Woman loosened the sleeves and pushed them to a
                        puff on the shoulders, catching them in places with pins. She began on the
                        wide draping of the yoke, fastening it front, back and at each shoulder. She
                        pulled down the waist and pinned it. Next came a soft white silk dress skirt
                        of her own. By pinning her waist band quite four inches above
                        Elnora&apos;s, the Bird Woman could secure a perfect Empire sweep, with
                        the clinging silk. Then she began with the wide white ribbon that was to
                        trim a new frock for herself, bound it three times around the high waist
                        effect she had managed, tied the ends in a knot and let them fall to the
                        floor in a beautiful sash.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want four white roses, each with two or three leaves,&quot;
                        she cried.</p>
                    <p>Anna ran for them, while the Bird Woman added pins.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora,&quot; she said, &quot;forgive me, but tell me
                        truly. Is your mother so extremely poor as to make this necessary?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;Next year I am heir to my
                        share of over three hundred acres of land covered <pb id="VAA2373-225"
                            n="216"/> with almost as valuable timber as was in the Limberlost. We
                        adjoin it. There could be dozens of oil wells drilled that would yield to us
                        the thousands our neighbours are draining from under us, and the bare land
                        is worth over one hundred dollars an acre for farming. She is not poor, she
                        isI don&apos;t know what she is. A great trouble soured and warped her.
                        It made her peculiar. She does not in the least understand, but it is
                        because she don&apos;t care to, instead of ignorance. She does
                        not&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora stopped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She isis different,&quot; finished the girl.</p>
                    <p>Anna came with the roses. The Bird Woman set one on the front of the draped
                        yoke, one on each shoulder and the last among the bright masses of brown
                        hair. Then she turned the girl facing the tall mirror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; panted Elnora. &quot;Is that me? You are a
                        genius! Why, I will look as well as any of them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, thank goodness for that!&quot; cried the Bird Woman.
                        &quot;If it wouldn&apos;t do, I should have been ill. You are
                        lovely; altogether lovely! Ordinarily I shouldn&apos;t say that; but
                        when I think of how you are carpentered, I&apos;m adoring the
                        result.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The organ began rolling out the march as they came in sight. Elnora took her
                        place at the head of the procession, while every one wondered. Secretly they
                        had hoped that she would be dressed well enough, that she would not appear
                        poor and neglected. What this radiant young creature, gowned in the most
                        recent style, her smooth skin flushed with excitement, and a rose-set <pb
                            id="VAA2373-226" n="217"/> coronet of red gold on her head, had to do
                        with the girl they knew was difficult to decide. The signal was given and
                        Elnora began the slow march across the vestry and down the aisle. The music
                        welled softly, and Margaret began to sob without knowing why.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock gripped her hands together and shut her eyes. It seemed an
                        eternity to the suffering woman before Margaret caught her arm and
                        whispered, &quot;Oh, Kate! For any sake look at her! Here! The aisle
                        across!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock opened her eyes and directing them where she was told, gazed
                        intently, and slid down in her seat on the verge of collapse. She was saved
                        by Margaret&apos;s tense grip and her command, &quot;Here! Idiot!
                        Stop that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the blaze of light Elnora climbed the steps to the palm-embowered
                        platform, crossed it and took her place. Sixty young men and women, each of
                        them dressed the best possible, followed her. There were manly, fine looking
                        men in that class which Elnora led. There were girls of beauty and grace,
                        but not one of them was hand-somer or clothed in better taste than she.</p>
                    <p>Billy thought the time never would come when Elnora would see him, but at
                        last she caught his eye, then Margaret and Wesley got faint signs of
                        recognition in turn, but there was no softening of the girl&apos;s face
                        and no hint of a smile when she saw her mother.</p>
                    <p>Heartsick, Katharine Comstock gripped her seat and tried to prove to herself
                        that she was justified in what she had done, but she could not. She tried to
                        blame <pb id="VAA2373-227" n="218"/> Elnora for not saying that she was to
                        lead a procession and sit on a platform in the sight of hundreds of people;
                        but that was impossible for she realized that she would have scoffed and not
                        understood if she had been told. Her heart pained until she suffered acute
                        agony with every breath.</p>
                    <p>When at last the exercises were over she climbed into the carriage and rode
                        home without a word. She did not hear what Margaret and Billy were saying.
                        She scarcely heard Sinton, who drove behind, when he told her that Elnora
                        would not be home until Wednesday. Early the next morning Mrs. Comstock was
                        on her way to Onabasha. She was waiting when the Brownlee store opened. She
                        examined ready-made white dresses, but they had only one of the right size,
                        and it was marked forty dollars. Mrs. Comstock did not hesitate over the
                        price, but whether the dress would be suitable. She would have to ask
                        Elnora. She inquired her way to the home of the Bird Woman and knocked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Elnora Comstock here?&quot; she asked the maid.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but she is still in bed. I was told to let her sleep as long
                        as she would.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe, I could sit here and wait,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;I want to see about getting her a dress for tomorrow. I am her
                        mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you don&apos;t need wait or worry,&quot; said the girl
                        cheerfully. &quot;There are two women up in the sewing-room at work on a
                        dress for her right now. It will be done in time, and it will be a
                        beauty.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-228" n="219"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock turned and trudged back to the Limberlost. The bitterness in
                        her soul became a physical actuality, and water would not wash the taste of
                        worm-wood from her lips. She was too late! She was not needed. Another woman
                        was mothering her girl. Another woman would prepare a beautiful dress such
                        as Elnora had worn last night. The girl&apos;s love and gratitude would
                        go to her. Mrs. Comstock tried the old process of blaming someone else, but
                        she felt no better. She nursed her grief as closely as ever in the long days
                        of the girl&apos;s absence. She brooded over Elnora&apos;s
                        possession of the forbidden violin and her ability to play it until the
                        performance could not have been told from her father&apos;s. She tried
                        every refuge her mind could conjure, to quiet her heart and remove the fear
                        that the girl never would come home again, but it persisted. Mrs. Comstock
                        could neither eat nor sleep. She wandered about the cabin and garden. She
                        kept far from the pool where Robert Comstock had sunk from sight for she
                        felt that it would entomb her also if Elnora did not come home Wednesday
                        morning. The mother told herself that she would wait, but the waiting was
                        bitter as anything she ever had known.</p>
                    <p>When Elnora awoke Monday another dress was in the hands of a seamstress and
                        was soon fitted. It had belonged to the Angel, and was a soft white thing
                        that with a little alteration would serve admirably for Commencement and the
                        ball. All that day Elnora worked, helping prepare the auditorium for the
                        exercises, <pb id="VAA2373-229" n="220"/> rehearsing the march and the
                        speech she was to make in behalf of the class. The next day was even more
                        busy. But her mind was at rest, for the dress was a soft delicate lace, easy
                        to change, and the marks of alteration impossible to detect.</p>
                    <p>The Bird Woman had telephoned to Grand Rapids, explained the situation and
                        asked the Angel if she might use it. The reply had been to give the girl all
                        the things the chest contained. When the Bird Woman told Elnora, tears
                        filled her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will write at once and thank her,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;With all her beautiful things she does not need them, and I do.
                        They will serve for me often, and be much finer than anything I could
                        afford. It is lovely of her to give me the dress and of you to have it
                        altered for me, as I never could.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Bird Woman laughed. &quot;I feel quite religious to-day,&quot;
                        she said. &quot;You know the first and greatest rock of my salvation is
                        &quot;Do unto others.&apos; I&apos;m only doing to you what
                        there was no one to do to me when I was a girl very like you. Anna tells me
                        your mother was here early this morning and that she came to see about
                        getting you a dress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is too late!&quot; said Elnora coldly. &quot;She had
                        over a month to prepare my dresses, and I was to pay for them, so there is
                        no excuse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nevertheless, she is your mother,&quot; said the Bird Woman,
                        softly. &quot;I think almost any kind of a mother must be better than
                        none at all, and you say she has had great trouble.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-230" n="221"/>
                    <p>&quot;She loved my father and he died,&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;The same thing, in quite as tragic a manner, has happened to
                        thousands of other women, and they have gone on with calm faces and found
                        happiness in life by loving others. There was something else I am afraid I
                        never shall forget; this I know I shall not, but talking does not help. I
                        must deliver my presents and photographs to the crowd. I have a picture and
                        I made a present for you, too, if you would care for them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall love anything you give me,&quot; said the Bird Woman.
                        &quot;I know you well enough to know that whatever you do will be
                        beautiful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora felt good over that, and as she tried on her dress for the last
                        fitting she was really happy. She looked lovely in the dainty gown, it would
                        serve finely for the ball and many other like occasions, and it was her very
                        own.</p>
                    <p>The Bird Woman&apos;s driver took Elnora in the carriage and she called
                        on all the girls with whom she was especially intimate, and left her picture
                        and the package containing her gift to them. By the time she returned,
                        parcels for her were arriving. Friends seemed to spring from everywhere.
                        Almost everyone she knew had some gift for her, while because they so loved
                        her the members of her crowd had made her beautiful presents. There were
                        books, vases, silver pieces, handkerchiefs, fans, boxes of flowers and
                        candy. One big package settled the trouble at Sintons&apos;, for it
                        contained a dainty dress from Margaret, a five-dollar gold piece,
                        conspicuously labeled, &quot;I earned this myself,&quot; from Billy,
                            <pb id="VAA2373-231" n="222"/> with which to buy music; and a gorgeous
                        cut glass perfume bottle, it would have cost five dollars to fill with even
                        a moderate-priced scent, from Wesley.</p>
                    <p>In an expressed crate was a fine curly-maple dressing table, sent by
                        Freckles. The drawers were filled with wonderful toilet articles from the
                        Angel. The Bird Woman added an embroidered linen cover and a small silver
                        vase for a few flowers and no girl of the class had finer gifts. Elnora laid
                        her head on the table sobbing happily, and the Bird Woman was almost crying
                        herself. Professor Henley sent an elegantly printed and illustrated
                        butterfly book, the grade rooms in which Elnora had taught gave her a set of
                        volumes covering every phase of life afield, in the woods, and water. Elnora
                        had no time to read so she just carried one of these books around with her
                        hugging it as she went. After she had gone to dress a queer looking package
                        was brought by a small boy who hopped on one foot as he handed it in and
                        said, &quot;Tell Elnora that is from her ma.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the Bird Woman, as she took the
                        bundle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m Billy!&quot; announced the boy. &quot;I gave
                        her the five dollars. I earned it myself dropping corn, sticking onions, and
                        pulling weeds. My, but you got to drop, and stick, and pull a lot before
                        it&apos;s five dollars&apos; worth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you like to come in and see Elnora&apos;s
                        gifts?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, ma&apos;m!&quot; said Billy trying to stand quietly.</p>
                    <p>He followed into the room and gazed around.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-232" n="223"/>
                    <p>&quot;Gee-mentley!&quot; he gasped. &quot;Does Elnora get all
                        this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet you a thousand dollars I be first in my class when I
                        graduate. Say, have the others got a lot more than Elnora?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Uncle Wesley said to find out if I could, and if she
                        didn&apos;t have as much as the rest, he&apos;d buy till she did, if
                        it took a hundred dollars. Say, you ought to know him! He&apos;s just
                        scrumptious! There ain&apos;t anybody anywhere finer &apos;an he is.
                        My, he&apos;s grand!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m quite sure of it!&quot; said the Bird Woman.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve often heard Elnora say so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy strutted around the table admiringly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet you nobody can beat this!&quot; he boasted. Then he
                        stopped, thinking deeply. &quot;I don&apos;t know, though,&quot;
                        he began reflectively. &quot;Some of them are awful rich; they got big
                        families to give them things and wagon loads of friends, and I
                        haven&apos;t seen what they got. Now, maybe Elnora is getting left,
                        after all!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He lifted an anxious little freckled face to the Bird Woman. She cleared her
                        throat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry, Billy,&quot; she said. &quot;I will
                        watch and if I find Elnora is &quot;getting left&apos; I&apos;ll
                        buy her some more things myself. But I&apos;m sure she is not. She has
                        more beautiful gifts now than she will know what to do with, and others will
                        come. Tell your Uncle Wesley his girl is bountifully remembered, very happy,
                        and she sends her dearest love to all of you. Now you must go, so I can <pb
                            id="VAA2373-233" n="224"/> help her dress. You will be there to-night to
                        see her, of course?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir-ee! She got me a seat, third row from the front, middle
                        section, so I can see, and she&apos;s going to wink at me, after she
                        gets her speech off her mind. She kissed me, too! She&apos;s a perfect
                        lady, Elnora is. I&apos;m going to marry her when I get big
                        enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why isn&apos;t that splendid!&quot; laughed the Bird Woman
                        as she hurried upstairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dear!&quot; she called. &quot;Here is another gift for
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora was half disrobed as she took the package and, sitting on a couch,
                        opened it. The Bird Woman bent over her and tested the fabric with her
                        fingers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, bless my soul!&quot; she cried. &quot;Hand woven, hand
                        embroidered linen, fine as silk. It&apos;s priceless! I haven&apos;t
                        seen such things in years. My mother had garments like those when I was a
                        child, but my sisters had them cut up for collars, belts, and fancy waists
                        while I was small. Look at the exquisite work!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where could it have come from?&quot; cried Elnora.</p>
                    <p>She shook out a petticoat, with a hand-wrought ruffle a foot deep, then an
                        old-fashioned chemise the neck and sleeve work of which was elaborate and
                        perfectly wrought. On the breast was pinned a note that she hastily opened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was married in these,&quot; it read, &quot;and I had
                        intended to be buried in them, but perhaps it would be more sensible for you
                        to graduate and get married in them yourself, if you would like. Your
                        mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;From my mother!&quot; Wide-eyed, Elnora looked at <pb
                            id="VAA2373-234" n="225"/> the Bird Woman. &quot;I never in my life
                        saw the like. Mother does things I think I never can forgive, and when I
                        feel hardest, she turns around and does something that makes me think she
                        just must love me a little bit, after all. Any of the girls would give
                        almost anything to graduate in hand-embroidered linen like that. Money
                        can&apos;t buy such things. And they came just when I was thinking she
                        didn&apos;t care what became of me. Do you suppose she can be
                        insane?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Bird Woman. &quot;Stark, staring mad!
                        Wildly insane, if she does not love you and care what becomes of
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora arose and held the petticoat to her. &quot;Will you look at
                        it?&quot; she cried. &quot;Only imagine her not getting my dress
                        ready, and then turning around and sending me such a petticoat as this!
                        Ellen would pay a hundred dollars for it and never blink. I suppose mother
                        has had it all my life, and I never saw it before.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go, take your bath and put on those things,&quot; said the Bird
                        Woman. &quot;Forget everything and be happy. She is not insane! She is
                        embittered. She did not understand how things would be. When she saw, she
                        came at once to get you a dress. This is her way of saying she is sorry she
                        did not get the other. You notice she has not spent any money, so perhaps
                        she is quite honest in saying she has none.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, she is honest!&quot; said Elnora. &quot;She
                        wouldn&apos;t care enough to tell an untruth. She&apos;d say just
                        how things were, no matter what happened.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-235" n="226"/>
                    <p>Soon Elnora was ready for her dress. She never had looked so well as when she
                        again headed the procession across the flower and palm decked stage of the
                        high school auditorium. As she sat there she could have reached over and
                        dropped a rose she carried into the seat she had occupied that September
                        morning four years previously when she entered the high school. She spoke
                        the few words she had to say in behalf of the class beautifully, had the
                        tiny wink ready for Billy, and the smile and nod of recognition for Wesley
                        and Margaret. When at last she looked into the eyes of a white-faced woman
                        next them, she slipped a hand to her side and raised her skirt the fraction
                        of an inch, just enough to let the embroidered edge of a petticoat show a
                        trifle. When she saw the look of relief which flooded her mother&apos;s
                        face, Elnora knew that forgiveness was in her heart, and that she would go
                        home in the morning.</p>
                    <p>It was late afternoon before she arrived, and a dray followed with a load of
                        packages. Mrs. Comstock was overwhelmed. She sat half dazed and made Elnora
                        show her each costly and beautiful or simple and useful gift, tell her
                        carefully what it was and from where it came. She studied the faces of
                        Elnora&apos;s particular friends intently. The gifts from them had to be
                        selected and set in a group. Several times she started to speak and then
                        stopped. At last, between her dry lips, came a harsh whisper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora, what did you give back for these things?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll show you,&quot; said Elnora cheerfully.
                        &quot;I got the <pb id="VAA2373-236" n="227"/> same thing for the Bird
                        Woman, Aunt Margaret and you, if you care for it. But I have to run upstairs
                        to get it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she returned she handed her mother an oblong frame, hand carved,
                        enclosing Elnora&apos;s picture, taken by a schoolmate&apos;s
                        camera. She wore her storm-coat and carried a dripping umbrella. From under
                        it looked her bright face; her books and lunchbox were on her arm, and
                        across the bottom of the frame was carved, &quot;Your Country
                        Classmate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she offered another frame.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am strong on frames,&quot; she said. &quot;They seemed to
                        be the best I could do without money. I located the maple and the black
                        walnut myself, in a little corner that had been overlooked between the river
                        and the ditch. They didn&apos;t seem to belong to anyone so I just took
                        them. Uncle Wesley said it was all right, and he cut and hauled them for me.
                        I gave the mill half of each tree for sawing and curing the remainder. Then
                        I gave the wood-carver half of that for making my frames. A photographer
                        gave me a lot of spoiled plates, and I boiled off the emulsion, and took the
                        specimens I framed from my stuff. The man said the white frames were worth
                        three and a half, and the black ones five. I exchanged those little framed
                        pictures for the photographs of the others. For presents, I gave each one of
                        my crowd one like this, only a different moth. The Bird Woman gave me the
                        birch bark. She got it up north last summer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora handed her mother a handsome black-walnut <pb id="VAA2373-237" n="228"
                        /> frame a foot and a half wide by two long. It finished a small shallow
                        glass-covered box of birch bark, to the botttom of which clung a big night
                        moth with delicate pale green wings and long exquisite trailers. A more
                        beautiful thing would have been difficult to imagine.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you see I did not have to be ashamed of my gifts,&quot; said
                        Elnora. &quot;I made them myself and raised and mounted the
                        moths.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Moth, you call it,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve seen a few of the things before.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are thick around us every June night, or at least they used to
                        be,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I&apos;ve sold hundreds of them,
                        with butterflies, dragon flies, and other specimens. Now, I must put away
                        these and get to work, for it is almost June and there are a few more I want
                        dreadfully. When I get them I will be paid some money for which I have
                        worked a long time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was afraid to say college just then. She thought it would be better to
                        wait a few days and see if an opportunity would not come when it would work
                        in more naturally. Besides, unless she could secure the yellow Emperor she
                        needed to complete her collection, she could not talk college until she was
                        of age, for she would have no money.</p>

                    <p>&quot;E<hi rend="sc">LNORA,</hi> bring me the towel, quick!&quot;
                        cried Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In a minute, mother,&quot; mumbled Elnora.</p>
                    <p>She was standing before the kitchen mirror, tying the back part of her hair,
                        while the front turned over her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hurry! There&apos;s a varmint of some kind!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora ran into the sitting room and thrust the heavy kitchen towel into her
                        mother&apos;s hand. Mrs. Comstock swung open the screen door and struck
                        at some object. Elnora tossed the hair from her face so that she could see
                        past her mother. The girl screamed wildly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t! Mother, don&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock struck again. Elnora caught her arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s the one I want! It&apos;s worth a lot of money!
                        Don&apos;t! Oh, you shall not!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shan&apos;t, missy?&quot; blazed Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;When did you get to bossing me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The hand that held the screen swept a half-circle and stopped at
                        Elnora&apos;s cheek. She staggered with the blow, and across her face,
                        paled with excitement, a red mark <pb id="VAA2373-239" n="230"/> rose
                        rapidly. The screen slammed shut, throwing the creature on the floor before
                        them. Instantly Mrs. Comstock&apos;s foot crushed it. Elnora stepped
                        back. Excepting the red mark, her face was very white.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was the last moth I needed,&quot; she said, &quot;to
                        complete a collection worth three hundred dollars. You&apos;ve ruined it
                        before my eyes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Moth!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock. &quot;You say that because
                        you are mad. Moths have big wings. I know a moth!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve kept things from you,&quot; said Elnora,
                        &quot;because I didn&apos;t dare confide in you. You had no sympathy
                        with me. But you know I never told you untruths in all my life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s no moth!&quot; reiterated Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;It&apos;s just out of
                        a case in the ground. Its wings take two or three hours to expand and
                        harden.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I had known it was a moth&quot; Mrs. Comstock wavered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You did know! I told you! I begged you to stop! It meant just three
                        hundred dollars to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bah! Three hundred fiddlesticks!&quot; sneered Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are what have paid for books, tuition, and clothes for the
                        last four years. They are what I could have started on to college.
                        You&apos;ve crushed the last one I needed before my face. You never have
                        made <pb id="VAA2373-240" n="231"/> any pretence of loving me. At last
                        I&apos;ll be equally frank with you. I hate you! You are a selfish,
                        wicked woman! I hate you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora turned, went through the kitchen and out the back door. She followed
                        the garden path to the gate and walked toward the swamp a short distance
                        when reaction overtook her. She dropped on the ground and leaned against a
                        big log. When a little child, desperate as now, she had tried to die by
                        holding her breath. She had thought in that way to make her mother sorry,
                        but she had learned that life was a thing thrust upon her and death would
                        not come at her wish.</p>
                    <p>She was so crushed over the loss of that moth, which she had childishly named
                        the yellow Emperor, that she scarcely remembered the blow. She had thought
                        no luck in all the world would be so rare as to complete her collection, and
                        she just had been forced to see a splendid Imperialis crushed to a mass
                        before her. There was a possibility that she could find another, but now she
                        was facing the certainty that the one she might have had and with which she
                        undoubtedly could have attracted others, was ruinedby her mother. How long
                        she sat there Elnora did not know or care. She simply suffered in dumb,
                        abject misery, an occasional dry sob shaking her. Aunt Margaret was right.
                        Elnora felt that morning that her mother never would be any different. The
                        girl had reached the place where she realized that she could bear it no
                        longer.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-241" n="232"/>
                    <p>As Elnora left the room, Mrs. Comtock took one step after her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You little huzzy!&quot; she gasped.</p>
                    <p>But Elnora was gone. Her mother stood staring.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She never did lie to me,&quot; she muttered. &quot;I guess
                        it was a moth. And the only one she needed to get three hundred dollars, she
                        said. I wish I hadn&apos;t been so fast! I never saw anything like it. I
                        thought it was some deadly, stinging, biting thing. A body does have to be
                        mighty careful here. But likely I&apos;ve spilt the milk now. Pshaw! She
                        can find another! There&apos;s no use to be foolish. Maybe moths are
                        like snakes, where there&apos;s one, there&apos;s two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock took the broom and swept the moth out of the door. Then she got
                        down on her knees and carefully examined the steps, logs and the earth of
                        the flower beds at each side. She found the place where the creature had
                        emerged from the ground, and the hard, dark brown case which had enclosed
                        it, still wet inside. Then she knew Elnora had been right. It was a moth.
                        Its wings had been damp and not expanded. Mrs. Comstock never before had
                        seen one in that state, and she did not know how they originated. She had
                        thought all of them came from cases spun on trees or against walls or
                        boards. She only had seen enough to know that there were such things, just
                        as a flash of white told her that an ermine was on her premises, or a sharp
                        &quot;buzzzzz&quot; warned her of a rattler.</p>
                    <p>So it was from creatures like that Elnora had gotten <pb id="VAA2373-242"
                            n="233"/> her school money. In one sickening sweep there rushed into the
                        heart of the woman a full realization of the width of the gulf which
                        separated her from her child. Lately many things had pointed toward it, none
                        more plainly than when Elnora, like a reincarnation of her father, had stood
                        fearlessly before a large city audience and played with even greater skill
                        than he, on what Mrs. Comstock felt very certain, was his violin. But that
                        little crawling creature of earth, crushed by her before its splendid yellow
                        and lavender wings could spread and carry it into the mystery of night, had
                        brought a realizing sense.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are nearer strangers with each other than we are with any of the
                        neighbours,&quot; she muttered.</p>
                    <p>So one of the Almighty&apos;s most delicate and beautiful creations was
                        sacrificed without fulfilling the law, yet none of its species ever served
                        so glorious a cause, for at last Mrs. Comstock&apos;s inner vision had
                        cleared. She went through the cabin mechanically. Every few minutes she
                        glanced toward the back walk to see if Elnora was coming. She knew
                        arrangements had been made with Margaret to go to the city some time that
                        day, so she grew more nervous and uneasy every moment. She was haunted by
                        the fear that the blow might discolour Elnora&apos;s cheek, and that she
                        would tell Margaret. She went down the back walk, looking intently in all
                        directions, left the garden and took the swamp path. Her step was noiseless
                        on the soft, black earth, and soon she came near enough to see Elnora. Mrs.
                        Comstock <pb id="VAA2373-243" n="234"/> stood looking at the girl in
                        troubled uncertainty. Not knowing what to say, at last she turned and went
                        back to the cabin.</p>
                    <p>Noon came and she prepared dinner, calling, as she always did, when Elnora
                        was in the garden, but she got no response, and the girl did not come. A
                        little after one o&apos;clock Margaret stopped at the gate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora has changed her mind. She is not going,&quot; called
                        Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>She felt that she hated Margaret as she hitched her horse and came up the
                        walk instead of driving on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must be mistaken,&quot; said Margaret. &quot;I was
                        going on purpose for her. She asked me to take her. I had no errand. Where
                        is she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will call her,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>She followed the path again, and this time found Elnora sitting on the log.
                        Her face was swollen and discoloured, and her eyes red with crying. She paid
                        no attention to her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mag Sinton is here,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock harshly.
                        &quot;I told her you had changed your mind, but she said you asked her
                        to go with you, and she had nothing to go for herself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora arose, recklessly took a short cut through the deep swamp grasses and
                        so reached the path ahead of her mother. Mrs. Comstock followed as far as
                        the garden, but she could not enter the cabin. She busied herself among the
                        vegetables, barely looking up when the back door screen slammed noisily.
                        Margaret Sinton <pb id="VAA2373-244" n="235"/> approached colourless, and
                        with such flaming eyes that Mrs. Comstock shrank back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with Elnora&apos;s face?&quot;
                        demanded Margaret.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock made no reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You struck her, did you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you wasn&apos;t blind!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have been, for twenty long years now, Kate Comstock,&quot;
                        said Margaret Sinton, &quot;but my eyes are open at last. What I see is
                        that I&apos;ve done you no good and Elnora a big wrong. I had an idea
                        that it would kill you to know, but I guess you are tough enough to stand
                        anything. Kill or cure, you get it now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you frothing about?&quot; coolly asked Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You!&quot; cried Margaret. &quot;You! The woman who
                        don&apos;t pretend to love her only child. Who lets her grow to a woman,
                        as you have let Elnora, and can&apos;t be satisfied with every sort of
                        neglect, but must add abuse yet; and all for a fool idea about a man who
                        wasn&apos;t worth his salt!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock picked up a hoe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go right on!&quot; she said. &quot;Empty yourself.
                        It&apos;s the last thing you&apos;ll ever do!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I&apos;ll make a tidy job of it,&quot; said Margaret.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll not touch me. You&apos;ll stand there and hear
                        the truth at last, and because I dare face you and tell it, you will know in
                        your soul it is truth. When Robert Comstock shaved that quagmire out there
                        so close he <pb id="VAA2373-245" n="236"/> went in, he wanted to keep you
                        from seeing where he was coming from. He&apos;d been to see Elvira
                        Carney. They had plans to go to a dance that night&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Close your lips!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock in a voice of deadly
                        quiet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know I wouldn&apos;t dare open them if I was not telling
                        you the truth. I can prove what I say. I was coming from Reeds. It was hot
                        in the woods and I stopped at Carney&apos;s as I passed for a drink.
                        Elvira&apos;s bedridden old mother heard me, and she was so crazy for
                        some one to talk with, I stepped in a minute. I saw Robert come down the
                        path. Elvira saw him, too, and she ran out of the house to head him off. It
                        looked funny, and I just deliberately moved where I could see and hear. He
                        brought her his violin, and told her to get ready and meet him in the woods
                        with it that night, and they would go to a dance. She took it and hid it in
                        the little loft to the well-house and promised she&apos;d go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you done?&quot; demanded Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>No. I am going to tell you the whole story. You don&apos;t spare Elnora
                        anything. I shan&apos;t spare you. I hadn&apos;t been here that day,
                        but I can tell you just how he was dressed, which way he went and every word
                        they said, though they thought I was busy with her mother and
                        wouldn&apos;t notice them. Put down your hoe, Kate. I went to Elvira,
                        told her what I knew and made her give me Comstock&apos;s violin for
                        Elnora over three years ago. She &apos;s been playing it ever since. I
                        won&apos;t see her <pb id="VAA2373-246" n="237"/> slighted and abused
                        another day on account of a man who would have broken your heart if he had
                        lived. Six months more would have showed you what everybody else knew. He
                        was one of those men who couldn&apos;t trust himself, and so no woman
                        was safe with him. Now, will you drop grieving over him, and do Elnora
                        justice?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock gripped the hoe tighter and turning she went down the walk, and
                        started across the woods to the home of Elvira Carney. With averted head she
                        passed the pool, steadily pursuing her way. Elvira Carney, hanging towels
                        across the back fence, saw her coming and went toward the gate to meet her.
                        Twenty years she had dreaded that visit. Since Margaret Sinton had compelled
                        her to produce the violin she had hidden so long, because she was afraid to
                        destroy it, she had come more near expectation than dread. The wages of sin
                        are the hardest debts on earth to pay, and they are always collected at
                        inconvenient times and unexpected places. Mrs. Comstock&apos;s face and
                        hair were so white, that her dark eyes seemed burned into their setting.
                        Silently she stared at the woman before her a long time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might have saved myself the trouble of coming,&quot; she said
                        at last, &quot;I see you are guilty as sin!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What has Mag Sinton been telling you?&quot; panted the
                        miserable woman, gripping the fence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The truth!&quot; answered Mrs. Comstock succinctly.
                        &quot;Guilt is in every line of your face, in your eyes, all over <pb
                            id="VAA2373-247" n="238"/> your wretched body. If I&apos;d taken a
                        good look at you any time in all these past years, no doubt I could have
                        seen it just as plain as I can now. No woman or man can do what
                        you&apos;ve done, and not get a mark set on them for everyone to
                        read.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mercy!&quot; gasped weak little Elvira Carney. &quot;Have
                        mercy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mercy?&quot; scoffed Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Mercy!
                        That&apos;s a nice word from you! How much mercy did you have on me?
                        Where&apos;s the mercy that sent Comstock to the slime of the bottomless
                        quagmire, and left me to see it, and then struggle on in agony all these
                        years? How about the mercy of letting me allow my baby to be neglected all
                        the days of her life? Mercy! Do you really dare use the word to
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you knew what I&apos;ve suffered!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suffered?&quot; jeered Mrs. Comstock. &quot;That&apos;s
                        interesting. And pray, what have you suffered?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All the neighbours have suspected and been down on me. I
                        ain&apos;t had a friend. I&apos;ve always felt guilty of his death!
                        I&apos;ve seen him go down a thousand times, plain as ever you did.
                        Many&apos;s the night I&apos;ve stood on the other bank of that pool
                        and listened to you, and I tried to throw myself in to keep from hearing
                        you, but I didn&apos;t dare. I knew God would send me to burn forever,
                        but I&apos;d better done it; for now, He has set the burning on my body,
                        and every hour it is slowly eating the life out of me. The doctor says
                        it&apos;s a cancer&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-248" n="239"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock exhaled a long breath. Her grip on the hoe relaxed and her
                        stature lifted to towering height.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know, or care, when I came here, just what I
                        did,&quot; she said. &quot;But my way is beginning to clear. If the
                        guilt of your soul has come to a head, in a cancer on your body, it looks as
                        if the Almighty didn&apos;t need any of my help in meting out His
                        punishments. I really couldn&apos;t fix up anything to come anywhere
                        near that. If you are going to burn until your life goes out with that sort
                        of fire, you don&apos;t owe me anything!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Katherine Comstock!&quot; groaned Elvira Carney, clinging
                        to the fence for support.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looks as if the Bible is right when it says, &quot;The wages of
                        sin is death,&apos; don&apos;t it?&quot; asked Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;Instead of doing a woman&apos;s work in life, you chose the
                        smile of invitation, and the dress of unearned cloth. Now you tell me you
                        are marked to burn to death with the unquenchable fire. And him! It was
                        shorter with him, but let me tell you he got his share! He left me with an
                        untruth on his lips, for he told me he was going to take his violin to
                        Onabasha for a new key, when he carried it to you. Every vow of love and
                        constancy he ever made me was a lie, after he touched your lips, so when he
                        tried the wrong side of the quagmire, to hide from me the direction in which
                        he was coming, it reached out for him, and it got him. It didn&apos;t
                        hurry, either! It just sucked him down, slow, and deliberate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mercy!&quot; groaned Elvira Carney. &quot;Mercy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know the word,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;You <pb id="VAA2373-249" n="240"/> took all that out of me long
                        ago. The last twenty years haven&apos;t been of the sort that taught
                        mercy. I&apos;ve never had any on myself and none on my child. Why, in
                        the name of justice, should I have mercy on you, or on him? You were both
                        older than me, both strong, sane people, you deliberately chose your course
                        when you lured him, and he, when he was unfaithful to me. When a Loose Man
                        and a Light Woman face the death the Almighty ordained for them, why should
                        they shout at me for mercy? What did I have to do with it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elvira Carney sobbed in panting gasps.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve got tears, have you?&quot; marvelled Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;Mine all dried long ago. I&apos;ve none left to shed
                        over my wasted life, my disfigured face and hair, my years of struggle with
                        a man&apos;s work, my wreck of land among the tilled fields of my
                        neighbours, or the final knowledge that the man I so gladly would have died
                        to save, wasn&apos;t worth the sacrifice of a rattlesnake. If anything
                        yet could wring a tear from me, it would be the thought of the awful
                        injustice I always have done my girl. If I&apos;d lay hand on you for
                        anything, it would be for that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kill me if you want to,&quot; sobbed Elvira Carney.&quot; I
                        know that I deserve it, and I don&apos;t care.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are getting your killing fast enough to suit me,&quot; said
                        Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t touch you, any more than I
                        would him, if I could. Once is all any man or woman deceives me about the
                        holiest things of life. I <pb id="VAA2373-250" n="241"/> wouldn&apos;t
                        touch you any more than I would the black plague. I am going back to my
                        girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock turned and started swiftly through the woods, but she had gone
                        only a few rods when she stopped, and leaning on the hoe, she stood thinking
                        deeply. Then she turned back. Elvira still clung to the fence, sobbing
                        bitterly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock, &quot;but
                        I left a wrong impression with you. I don&apos;t want you to think that
                        I believe the Almighty set a cancer to burning you as a punishment for your
                        sins. I don&apos;t! I think a lot more of the Almighty. With a whole
                        sky-full of worlds on His hands to manage, I&apos;m not believing that
                        He has time to look down on ours, and pick you out of all the millions of we
                        sinners, and set a special kind of torture to eating you. It
                        wouldn&apos;t be a gentlemanly thing to do, and, first of all, the
                        Almighty is bound to be a gentleman. I think likely a bruise and bad blood
                        is what caused your trouble. Anyway, I &apos;ve got to tell you that the
                        cleanest housekeeper I ever knew, and one of the noblest Christian women,
                        was slowly eaten up by a cancer. She got hers from the careless work of a
                        poor doctor. The Almighty is to forgive sin and heal disease, not to invent
                        and spread it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had gone only a few steps when she again turned back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you will gather a lot of red clover bloom, make a tea strong as
                        lye of it, and drink quarts, I think likely it will help you, if you are not
                        too far gone.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-251" n="242"/>
                    <p>Anyway, it will cool your blood and make the burning easier to
                        bear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she swiftly walked home. Enter the lonely cabin she could not, neither
                        could she sit outside and think. She attacked a bed of beets and hoed until
                        the perspiration ran from her face and body, then she began on the potatoes.
                        When she was too tired to take another stroke she bathed and put on dry
                        clothing. In securing her dress she noticed her husband&apos;s carefully
                        preserved clothing lining one wall. She gathered it in a great armload and
                        carried it out to the swamp. Piece by piece she pitched into the green maw
                        of the quagmire all those articles she had dusted carefully and fought moths
                        from for years, and stood watching as it slowly sucked them down. She went
                        back to her room and gathered every scrap that had in any way belonged to
                        Robert Comstock, excepting his gun and revolver, and threw it into the
                        swamp. Then for the first time she set her door wide open.</p>
                    <p>She was too weary now to do more, but an urging unrest drove her. She wanted
                        Elnora. It seemed to her she never could wait until the girl came and
                        delivered her judgment. At last in an effort to get nearer to her, Mrs.
                        Comstock climbed the stairs and stood looking around Elnora&apos;s room.
                        It was very unfamiliar. The pictures were strange to her. Commencement had
                        filled it with packages and bundles. The walls were covered with cocoons;
                        moths and dragon flies were pinned about. Under the bed she could see a
                        half-dozen large <pb id="VAA2373-252" n="243"/> white boxes. She did not
                        know what they contained. She pulled out one and lifted the lid. The bottom
                        was covered with a sheet of thin cork, and on long pins sticking in it were
                        dozens of great, velvet-winged moths. Each one was labelled, always there
                        were two of a kind, in many cases four, showing under and upper wings of
                        both male and female. They were of every colour and shape.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock caught her breath sharply. When and where had Elnora gotten all
                        of them? They were the most exquisite sight the woman ever had seen, so she
                        opened all the boxes to feast on their beautiful contents. As she did so
                        there came more fully a sense of the distance between her and her child. She
                        could not understand how Elnora had gone to school, and performed all this
                        work secretly. When it was finished, up to the very last moth, she, the
                        mother who should have been the first confidant and helper, had been the one
                        to bring disappointment. Small wonder Elnora had come to hate her.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock carefully closed and replaced the boxes, and again stood
                        looking around the room. This time her eyes rested on some books she did not
                        remember having seen before, so she picked up one and found that it was a
                        moth book. She glanced over the first pages and was soon eagerly reading.
                        When the text reached the classification of species, she laid it down, took
                        up another and read its introductory chapters. Then she found some papers
                        and studied them. By <pb id="VAA2373-253" n="244"/> that time her brain was
                        in a confused jumble of ideas about capturing moths with differing baits and
                        bright lights.</p>
                    <p>She went downstairs thinking deeply. Being unable to sit still and having
                        nothing else to do she glanced at the clock and began preparing supper. The
                        work dragged. A chicken was snatched up and dressed hurriedly. A spice cake
                        sprang into being in short order. Strawberries that had been intended for
                        preserves went into shortcake. Delicious odours crept from the cabin. She
                        put many extra touches on the table and then commenced watching the road.
                        Everything was ready, but Elnora did not come. Then began the anxious
                        process of trying to keep cooked food warm and not spoil it. The birds went
                        to bed and dusk came. Mrs. Comstock gave up the fire and set the supper on
                        the table. Then she went out and sat on the front door step watching night
                        creep all around her. She started eagerly as the gate creaked, but it was
                        only Wesley Sinton coming down the walk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Katharine, Margaret and Elnora passed where I was working this
                        afternoon, and Margaret got out of the carriage and called me to the fence.
                        She told me what she had done. I&apos;ve come to say to you that I am
                        sorry. She has heard me threaten to do it a good many times, but I never
                        would have got it done. I&apos;d give a good deal if I could undo it,
                        but I can&apos;t, so I&apos;ve come to tell you how sorry I
                        am.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve got something to be sorry for,&quot; said Mrs.
                            <pb id="VAA2373-254" n="245"/> Comstock, &quot;but likely we
                        ain&apos;t thinking of the same thing. It hurts me less to know the
                        truth, than to live in ignorance. If Mag had the sense of a pewee,
                        she&apos;d told me long ago. That&apos;s what hurts me, to think
                        that both of you knew Robert was not worth an hour of honest grief, yet
                        you&apos;d let me mourn him all these years and neglect Elnora while I
                        did it. If I have anything to forgive you, that is what it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sinton took off his hat and sat on a bench.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Katharine,&quot; he said solemnly, &quot;nobody ever knows
                        how to take you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would it be asking too much to take me for having a few grains of
                        plain common sense?&quot; she inquired. &quot;You&apos;ve known
                        all this time that Comstock got what he deserved, when he undertook to sneak
                        in an unused way across a swamp, with which he was none too familiar. Now I
                        should have thought that you&apos;d figure that knowing the same thing
                        would be the best method to cure me of pining for him, and slighting my
                        child.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Heaven only knows we have thought of that, and talked of it often,
                        but we were both too big cowards. We didn&apos;t dare tell
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you have gone on year after year, watching me show indifference
                        to Elnora, and yet a little horse-sense would have pointed out to you that
                        she was my salvation. Why, look at it! Not married quite a year. All his
                        vows of love and fidelity made to me before the Almighty forgotten in a few
                        months, and a dance and a Light Woman so alluring he had to lie and sneak
                        for <pb id="VAA2373-255" n="246"/> them. What kind of a prospect is that for
                        a life? I know men and women. An honourable man is an honourable man, and a
                        liar is a liar; both are born and not made. One cannot change to the other
                        any more than that some old leopard can change its spots. After a man tells
                        a woman the first untruth of that sort, the others come piling thick, fast,
                        and mountain high. The desolation they bring in their wake overshadows
                        anything I have suffered completely. If he had lived six months more I
                        should have known him for what he was born to be. It was in the blood of
                        him. His father and grandfather before him were fiddling, dancing people;
                        but I was certain of him. I thought we could leave Ohio and come out here
                        alone, and I could so love him and interest him in his work, that he would
                        be a man. Of all the fool, fruitless jobs, making anything of a creature
                        that begins by deceiving her, is the foolest a sane woman ever undertook. I
                        am more than sorry you and Margaret didn&apos;t see your way clear to
                        tell me long ago. I&apos;d have found it out in a few more months if he
                        had lived, and I wouldn&apos;t have borne it a day. The man who breaks
                        his vows to me once, don&apos;t get the second chance. I give truth and
                        honour. I have a right to ask it in return. I am glad I understand at last.
                        Now, if Elnora will forgive me, we will take a new start and see what we can
                        make out of what is left of life. If she won&apos;t, then it will be my
                        time to learn what suffering really means.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But she will,&quot; said Sinton. &quot;She must! She
                        can&apos;t <pb id="VAA2373-256" n="247"/> help it when things are
                        explained. Don&apos;t you worry over her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I notice she isn&apos;t hurrying any about coming home. Do you
                        know where she is or what she is doing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not. But likely she will be along soon. I must go help Billy
                        with the night work. Good-bye, Katharine. Thank the Lord you have come to
                        yourself at last!&quot;</p>
                    <p>They shook hands and Sinton went down the road while Mrs. Comstock entered
                        the cabin. She went to the supper table, but she could not swallow food. She
                        stood in the back door watching the sky for moths, but they did not seem to
                        be very numerous. Her spirits sank and she breathed unevenly. Then she heard
                        the front screen. She reached the middle door as Elnora touched the foot of
                        the stairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hurry, and get ready, Elnora,&quot; she said. &quot;Your
                        supper is almost spoiled now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora closed the stair door behind her, and for the first time in her life,
                        threw the heavy lever which barred out anyone from downstairs. Mrs. Comstock
                        heard the thud, and knew what it meant. She reeled slightly and caught the
                        doorpost for support. For a few minutes she clung there, then sank to the
                        nearest chair. After a long time she arose and stumbling half blindly, she
                        put the food in the cupboard and covered the table. She took the lamp in one
                        hand, the butter in the other, and started for the spring house. Something
                        brushed close by her face, and she looked just <pb id="VAA2373-257" n="248"
                        /> in time to see a winged creature rise above the cabin and sail away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was a night bird,&quot; she muttered. As she stooped to
                        set the butter in the water, came another thought. &quot;Perhaps it was
                        a moth!&quot; Mrs. Comstock dropped the butter and hurried out with the
                        lamp, she held it high above her head and waited until her arms ached. Small
                        insects of night gathered, and at last a little dusty miller, but nothing
                        came of any size.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I got to go where they are, if I get them,&quot; muttered Mrs.
                        Comstock.</p>
                    <p>She hurried into the cabin, set the lamp on the table, and stood thinking
                        deeply. She went to the barn for the pair of stout high boots she used in
                        feeding stock in deep snow. Throwing the boots by the back door she climbed
                        to the loft over the spring house, and hunted an old lard oil lantern and
                        one of first manufacture for oil. Both these she cleaned and filled. She
                        listened until everything upstairs had been still for over a half-hour. By
                        that time it was after eleven o&apos;clock. Then she took the good
                        lantern from the kitchen, the two old ones, a handful of matches, a ball of
                        twine, and went from the cabin, softly closing the door.</p>
                    <p>Sitting on the back steps, she put on the boots, and then stood gazing into
                        the sweet June night, first in the direction of the woods on her land, then
                        toward the Limberlost. Its outline looked so dark and forbidding she
                        shuddered and went down the garden, taking the path toward the woods, but as
                        she neared the pool her <pb id="VAA2373-258" n="249"/> knees wavered and her
                        courage fled. The knowledge that in her soul she was now glad Robert
                        Comstock was at the bottom of it made a coward of her, who fearlessly had
                        mourned him there, nights untold. She could not go on. She skirted the back
                        of the garden, crossed a field, and came out on the road. Soon she reached
                        the Limberlost. She hunted until she found the old trail, then followed it
                        stumbling over logs and through clinging vines and grasses. The heavy boots
                        clumped on her feet, overhanging branches whipped her face and pulled her
                        hair. But her eyes were on the sky as she went straining into the night,
                        hoping to find signs of a living creature on wing.</p>
                    <p>By and by she began to see the wavering flight of something she thought near
                        the right size. She had no idea where she was, but she stopped, lighted a
                        lantern and hung it as high as she could reach. A little distance away she
                        placed the second and then the third. The objects came nearer and sick with
                        disappointment she saw that they were bats. Crouching in the damp swamp
                        grasses, without a thought of snakes or venomous insects, she waited, her
                        eyes roving from lantern to lantern. Once she thought a creature of high
                        flight dropped near the lard oil light, so she arose breathlessly waiting,
                        but either it passed or it was an illusion. She glanced at the old lantern,
                        then at the new, and was on her feet in an instant creeping close. Something
                        large as a small bird was fluttering around. Mrs. Comstock began to
                        perspire, while her hand shook wildly. Closer she <pb id="VAA2373-259"
                            n="250"/> crept and just as she reached for it, something similar swept
                        by and both flew away together.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock set her teeth and stood shivering. For a long time the locusts
                        rasped, the whip-poor-wills cried and a steady hum of night life throbbed in
                        her ears. Away in the sky she saw something coming when it was no larger
                        than a falling leaf. Straight on toward the light it came. Without in the
                        least realizing what she was doing, Mrs. Comstock began to pray aloud.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This way, O Lord! Make it come this way! Please! You know how I
                        need it! O Lord, send it lower!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The moth hesitated at the first light, then slowly, easily it came toward the
                        second, as if following a path of air. It touched a leaf near the lantern
                        and settled. As Mrs. Comstock reached for it a thin yellow spray wet her
                        hand and the surrounding leaves. When its wings raised above its back, her
                        fingers came together. She held the moth to the light. It was nearer brown
                        than yellow, and she remembered having seen some like it in the boxes that
                        afternoon. It was not the one needed to complete the collection, but Elnora
                        might want it, so Mrs. Comstock held on. Just there the Almighty was kind,
                        or nature was sufficient, as you look at it, for following the law of its
                        being when disturbed, the moth again threw the spray by which some suppose
                        it attracts its kind, and liberally sprinkled Mrs. Comstock&apos;s dress
                        front and arms. From that instant, she became the best moth <pb
                            id="VAA2373-260" n="251"/> bait ever invented. Every Polyphemus in range
                        hastened to her, and other fluttering creatures of night followed. The
                        influx came her way. She snatched wildly here and there until she had one in
                        each hand and no place to put them. She could see more coming, and her
                        aching heart, swollen with the strain of long excitement, hurt pitifully.
                        She prayed in broken exclamations that did not always sound reverent, but
                        never was human soul in more deadly earnest.</p>
                    <p>Moths were coming. She had one in each hand. They were not yellow, and she
                        did not know what to do. She glanced around to try to discover some way to
                        keep what she had, and her throbbing heart stopped and every muscle
                        stiffened. There was the dim outline of a crouching figure not two yards
                        away, and a pair of eyes their owner thought hidden, caught the light in a
                        cold stream. Her first impulse was to scream and fly for life. Before her
                        lips could open a big moth alighted on her breast while she felt another
                        walking over her hair. All sense of caution deserted her, She did not care
                        to live if she could not replace the yellow moth she had killed. She set her
                        eyes on those among the leaves.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here, you!&quot; she cried hoarsely. &quot;I need you! Get
                        yourself out here, and help me. These critters are going to get away from
                        me, and I&apos;ve got to have them. Hustle!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pete Corson parted the bushes and stepped into the light.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it&apos;s you!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I
                        might have <pb id="VAA2373-261" n="252"/> known! But you gave me a start.
                        Here, hold these until I make some sort of bag for them. Go easy! If you
                        break them I don&apos;t guarantee what will happen to you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pretty fierce, ain&apos;t you!&quot; laughed Pete, but he
                        advanced and held out his hands. &quot;For Elnora, I
                        s&apos;pose?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;In a mad fit, I
                        trampled one this morning, and by the luck of the old boy himself it was the
                        last moth she needed to complete a collection. I got to get another one or
                        die.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I guess it&apos;s your funeral,&quot; said Pete.
                        &quot;There ain&apos;t a chance in a dozen the right one will come.
                        What colour was it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yellow, and big as a bird.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Emperor, likely,&quot; said Pete. &quot;You dig for
                        that kind, and they are not numerous, so&apos;s &apos;at you can
                        smash &apos;em for fun.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I can try to get one, anyway,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;I forgot all about bringing anything to put them in. You take a
                        pinch on their wings until I make a poke.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock removed her apron, tearing off the strings. She unfastened and
                        stepped from the skirt of her calico dress. With one apron string she tied
                        shut the band and placket. She pulled a wire pin from her hair, stuck it
                        through the other string, and using it as a bodkin ran it around the hem of
                        her skirt. Her fingers flew, and shortly she had a large bag. She put
                        several branches inside to which the moths could cling, closed the mouth
                        partially and held it toward Pete.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-262" n="253"/>
                    <p>&quot;Put your hand well down and let the things go!&quot; she
                        ordered. &quot;But be careful, man! Don&apos;t run into the twigs!
                        Easy! That&apos;s one. Now the other. Is the one on my head gone? There
                        was one on my dress, but I guess it flew. Here comes a kind of a
                        gray-looking one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pete slipped several more moths into the bag.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, that&apos;s five, Mrs. Comstock,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but you&apos;ll have to make that do. You
                        must get out of here lively. Your lights will be taken for hurry calls, and
                        inside the next hour a couple of men will ride here like fury. They
                        won&apos;t be nice Sunday school men, and they won&apos;t hold bags
                        and catch moths for you. You must go quick!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock laid down the bag and pulled one of the lanterns lower.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t budge a step,&quot; she said. &quot;This
                        land don&apos;t belong to you. You have no right to order me off it.
                        Here I stay until I get a yellow Emperor, and no little petering thieves of
                        this neighbourhood can scare me away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t understand,&quot; said Pete.
                        &quot;I&apos;m willing to help Elnora, and I&apos;d take care of
                        you, if I could, but there will be too many for me, and they will be mad at
                        being called out for nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, who&apos;s calling them out?&quot; demanded Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;I&apos;m catching moths. If a lot of
                        good-for-nothings get fooled into losing some sleep, why, let them, they
                        can&apos;t hurt me, or stop my work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They can, and they&apos;ll do both.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-263" n="254"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll see them do it!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve got Robert&apos;s revolver in my dress, and I
                        can shoot as straight as any man, if I&apos;m mad enough. Anyone that
                        interferes with me to-night will find me mad aplenty. There goes
                        another!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stepped into the light and waited until a big brown moth settled on her
                        and was easily taken. Then in light, airy flight came a delicate pale green
                        thing, and Mrs. Comstock started in pursuit. But the scent was not right.
                        The moth fluttered high, then dropped lower, still lower, and sailed away.
                        With outstretched hands Mrs. Comstock pursued it. She hurried one way and
                        another, then ran over an object which tripped her and she fell. She
                        regained her feet in an instant, but she had lost sight of the moth. With
                        livid face she turned on the crouching man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You nasty, sneaking son of Satan!&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;Why are you hiding there? You made me lose the one I wanted most
                        of any I&apos;ve had a chance at yet. Get out of here! Go this minute,
                        or I&apos;ll fill your worthless carcass so full of holes
                        you&apos;ll do to sift cornmeal. Go, I say! I&apos;m using the
                        Limberlost to-night, and I won&apos;t be stopped by the devil himself!
                        Cut like fury, and tell the rest of them they can just go home. Pete is
                        going to help me, and he is all of you I need. Now go!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man turned and went. Pete leaned against a tree, held his mouth shut and
                        shook inwardly. Mrs. Comstock came back panting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The old scoundrel made me lose that!&quot; she said. <pb
                            id="VAA2373-264" n="255"/> &quot;If anyone else comes snooping
                        around here I&apos;ll just blow them up to start with. I
                        haven&apos;t time to talk. Suppose that had been yellow! I&apos;d
                        have killed that man, sure! The Limberlost isn&apos;t safe to-night, and
                        the sooner those whelps find it out, the better it will be for
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pete stopped laughing to look at her. He saw that she was speaking the truth.
                        She was quite past reason, sense, or fear. The soft night air stirred the
                        wet hair around her temples, the flickering lanterns made her face a ghastly
                        green. She would stop at nothing, that was evident. Pete suddenly began
                        catching moths with exemplary industry. In putting one into the bag, another
                        escaped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We must not try that again,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;Now, what will we do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are close to the old case,&quot; said Pete. &quot;I
                        think I can get into it. Maybe we could slip the rest in there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a fine idea!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;They&apos;ll have so much room there they won&apos;t be
                        likely to hurt themselves, and the books say they don&apos;t fly in
                        daytime unless they are disturbed, so they will settle when it&apos;s
                        light, and I can come with Elnora to get them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They captured two more, and then Pete carried them to the case.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here comes a big one!&quot; he cried as he returned.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock looked up and stepped out with a prayer on her lips. She could
                        not tell the colour at that distance, but the moth appeared different from
                        the others. <pb id="VAA2373-265" n="256"/> On it came, dropping lower and
                        darting from light to light. As it swept near her, &quot;O Heavenly
                        Father!&quot; exulted Mrs. Comstock, &quot;it&apos;s yellow!
                        Careful, Pete! Your hat, maybe!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pete made a long sweep. The moth wavered above the hat and sailed away. Mrs.
                        Comstock leaned against a tree and covered her face with her shaking hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is my punishment!&quot; she cried. &quot;Oh, Lord, if
                        you will give a moth like that into my possession, I&apos;ll always be a
                        better woman!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Emperor again came in sight. Pete stood tense and ready. Mrs. Comstock
                        stepped into the light and watched the moth&apos;s course. Then a second
                        appeared in pursuit of the first. The larger one wavered into the radius of
                        light once more. The perspiration rolled down the man&apos;s tense face.
                        He half lifted the hat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pray, woman! Pray now!&quot; he panted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess I best get over by that lard oil light and go to
                        work,&quot; breathed Mrs. Comstock. &quot;The Lord knows this is all
                        in prayer, but it&apos;s no time for words just now. Ready, Pete! You
                        are going to get a chance first!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pete made another long, steady sweep, but the moth darted beneath the hat. In
                        its flight it came straight toward Mrs. Comstock. She snatched off the
                        remnant of apron she had tucked into her petticoat band and held the calico
                        before her. The moth struck full against it and clung to the goods. Pete
                        crept up stealthily. The second moth followed the first, and the spray
                        showered the apron.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-266" n="257"/>
                    <p>&quot;Wait!&quot; gasped Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I think they have
                        settled. The books say they won&apos;t leave now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The big pale yellow creature clung firmly, lowering and raising its wings.
                        The other came nearer. Mrs. Comstock held the cloth with rigid hands, while
                        Pete could hear her breathing in short gusts.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I try now?&quot; he implored.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait!&quot; whispered the woman. &quot;Something seems to
                        say wait!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The night breeze stiffened and gently waved the apron. Locusts rasped,
                        mosquitoes hummed and frogs sang uninterruptedly. A musky odour slowly
                        filled the air.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now shall I?&quot; questioned Pete.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Leave them alone. They are safe now. They are mine. They are my
                        salvation. God and the Limberlost gave them to me! They won&apos;t move
                        for hours. The books all say so. O Heavenly Father, I am thankful to You,
                        and you, too, Pete Corson! You are a good man to help me. Now, I can go home
                        and face my girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Instead, Mrs. Comstock dropped suddenly. She spread the apron across her
                        knees. The moths were undisturbed. Then her tired white head dropped, the
                        tears she had thought forever dried gushed forth, and she sobbed for pure
                        joy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I wouldn&apos;t do that now, you know!&quot; comforted
                        Pete. &quot;Think of getting two! That&apos;s more than you ever
                        could have expected. A body would think you would cry, if you
                        hadn&apos;t got any. Come on, now. It&apos;s almost morning. Let me
                        help you home.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-267" n="258"/>
                    <p>Pete took the bag and the two old lanterns. Mrs. Comstock carried her moths
                        and the best lantern and went ahead to light the way.</p>
                    <p>Elnora bad sat by her window far into the night. At last she undressed and
                        went to bed, but sleep would not come. She had gone to the city to talk with
                        members of the School Board about a room in the grades. There was a
                        possibility that she might secure the moth, and so be able to start to
                        college that fall, but if she did not, then she wanted the school. She had
                        been given some encouragement, but she was so unhappy that nothing mattered.
                        She could not see the way open to anything in life, while she remained with
                        her mother, save a long series of disappointments. Yet Margaret Sinton had
                        advised her to go home and try once more. Margaret had seemed so sure there
                        would be a change for the better, that Elnora had consented, although she
                        had no hope herself. So strong is the bond of blood, she could not make up
                        her mind to seek a home elsewhere, even after the day which had passed.
                        Unable to sleep she arose at last, and the room being warm, she sat on the
                        floor by the window. The lights in the swamp caught her eye. She was very
                        uneasy, for quite a hundred of her best moths were in the case. However,
                        there was no money, and no one ever had touched a book or any of her
                        apparatus. Watching the lights set her thinking, and before she realized it,
                        she was in a panic or fear.</p>
                    <p>She hurried down the stairway softly calling her mother. There was no answer.
                        She lightly stepped across the <pb id="VAA2373-268" n="259"/> sitting room
                        and looked in at the open door. There was no one, and the bed had not been
                        used. Her first thought was that her mother had gone to the pool; and the
                        Limberlost was alive with signals. Pity and fear mingled in the heart of the
                        girl. She opened the kitchen door crossed the garden and ran back to the
                        swamp. As she neared it she listened, but she could hear only the usual
                        voices of night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother!&quot; she called softly. Then louder,
                        &quot;Mother!&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was not a sound. Chilled with fright she hurried back to the cabin. She
                        did not know what to do. She understood what the lights in the Limberlost
                        meant. Where was her mother? She was afraid to enter, while she was growing
                        very cold and still more fearful about remaining outside. At last she went
                        to her mother&apos;s room, picked up the gun, carried it into the
                        kitchen, and crowding in a little corner behind the stove, she waited in
                        trembling anxiety. The time was dread-fully long before she heard her
                        mother&apos;s voice. Then she decided that someone had been ill and sent
                        for her, so she took courage, and stepping swiftly across the kitchen she
                        unbarred the door and drew back out of sight by the table.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock entered dragging her heavy feet. Her dress skirt was gone, her
                        petticoat wet and drabbled, and the waist of her dress was almost torn from
                        her body. Her hair hung in damp strings; her eyes were red with crying. In
                        one hand she held the lantern, and in the other stiffly extended before her,
                        on a wad of calico <pb id="VAA2373-269" n="260"/> reposed a magnificent pair
                        of yellow Emperors. Elnora stared, her lips parted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I put these others in the kitchen?&quot; inquired a
                        man&apos;s voice.</p>
                    <p>The girl shrank back to the shadows.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, anywhere inside the door,&quot; replied Mrs. Comstock as
                        she moved a few steps to make way for him. Pete&apos;s head appeared. He
                        set down the moths and was gone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, Pete, more than ever woman thanked you before!&quot;
                        said Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>She placed the lantern on the table and barred the door. As she turned Elnora
                        came into view. Mrs. Comstock leaned toward her, and held out the moths. In
                        a voice vibrant with tones never before heard she said, &quot;Elnora, my
                        girl, mother&apos;s found you another moth!&quot;</p>

                    </head>
                    <p>E<hi rend="sc">LNORA</hi> awoke at dawn and lay gazing around the unfamiliar
                        room. She noticed that every vestige of masculine attire and belongings was
                        gone, and knew, without any explanation, what that meant. For some reason
                        every tangible evidence of her father was banished, and she was at last to
                        be allowed to take his place. She turned to look at her mother. Mrs.
                        Comstock&apos;s face was white and haggard, but on it rested an
                        expression of profound peace Elnora never before had seen. As she studied
                        the features on the pillow beside her, the heart of the girl throbbed in
                        tenderness. She realized as fully as any one else could what her mother had
                        suffered. Thoughts of the night brought shuddering fear. She softly slipped
                        from the bed, went to her room, dressed and entered the kitchen to attend
                        the Emperors and prepare breakfast. The pair had been left clinging to the
                        piece of calico. The calico was there and a few pieces of beautiful wing. A
                        mouse had eaten the moths!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, of all the horrible luck!&quot; gasped Elnora.</p>
                    <p>With the first thought of her mother, she caught up the remnants of the
                        moths, burying them in the ashes <pb id="VAA2373-271" n="262"/> of the
                        stove. She took the bag to her room, hurriedly releasing its contents, but
                        there was not another yellow one. Her mother had said some had been confined
                        in the case in the Limberlost. There was still a hope that an Emperor might
                        be among them. She peeped at her mother, who still slept soundly.</p>
                    <p>Elnora took a large piece of mosquito netting, and ran to the swamp. Throwing
                        it over the top of the case, she unlocked the door. She reeled, faint with
                        distress. The living moths that had been confined there in their fluttering
                        to escape to night and the mates they sought not only had wrecked the other
                        specimens of the case, but torn themselves to ribbons on the pins. A third
                        of the rarest moths of the collection for the man of India were antennless,
                        legless, wingless, and often headless. Elnora sobbed aloud.</p>
                    <p>At last she closed the door, dropped the netting, and sank on a log, staring
                        before her with unseeing eyes, trying to think.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is overwhelming,&quot; she said at last. &quot;It is
                        making a fatalist of me. I am beginning to think things happen as they are
                        ordained from the beginning, this plainly indicating that there is to be no
                        college, at least, this year, for me. My life is all mountain-top or caon. I
                        wish someone would lead me into a few days of &quot;green
                        pastures.&apos; Last night I went to sleep on mother&apos;s arm, the
                        moths all secured, love and college, certainties. This morning I wake to
                        find all my hopes wrecked. I simply don&apos;t dare let mother know that
                        instead of helping me, <pb id="VAA2373-272" n="263"/> she has ruined my
                        collection. Everything is gone!unless the love lasts. That actually seemed
                        true. I believe I will go see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The love remained. Indeed, in the overflow of the long hardened, pent-up
                        heart, the girl was almost suffocated with tempestuous caresses and generous
                        offerings. Before the day was over, Elnora realized that she never had known
                        her mother at all. The woman who now busily went through the cabin, her eyes
                        bright, eager, alert, constantly planning, was a stranger. Her very face was
                        different, while it did not seem possible that during one night the acid of
                        twenty years could disappear from a voice and leave it sweet and pleasant.</p>
                    <p>For the next few days Elnora worked at mounting the moths her mother had
                        taken. She had to go to the Bird Woman and tell about the disaster, but Mrs.
                        Comstock was allowed to think that Elnora delivered the moths when she made
                        the trip. If she had told her what actually happened, the chances were that
                        Mrs. Comstock again would have taken possession of the Limberlost, hunting
                        there until she replaced all the moths that had been destroyed. But Elnora
                        knew from experience what it meant to collect such a list in pairs. Valiant
                        as she was in any good cause, this time she was compelled to admit that she
                        was defeated. It would require hard work for at least two summers to replace
                        the lost moths. When she left the Bird Woman she went to the president of
                        the Onabasha schools and asked him <pb id="VAA2373-273" n="264"/> to do all
                        in his power to secure her a room in one of the ward buildings.</p>
                    <p>The next morning the last moth was mounted, and the house work finished.
                        Elnora said to her mother, &quot;If you don&apos;t mind, I believe I
                        will go into the woods pasture beside Sleepy Snake creek and see if I can
                        catch some dragon flies or moths.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait until I get a knife and a pail and I will go along,&quot;
                        answered Mrs. Comstock. &quot;The dandelions are plenty tender for
                        greens among the deep grasses, and I might just happen to see something
                        myself. My eyes are pretty sharp.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you could realize how young you are,&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;I know women in Onabasha who are ten years older than you, yet
                        they look twenty years younger. So could you, if you would dress your hair
                        becomingly, and wear appropriate clothes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think my hair puts me in the old woman class
                        permanently,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock, but there was no bitterness in
                        her voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it don&apos;t!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;There is
                        a woman of twenty-eight who has hair as white as yours from sick headaches,
                        but her face is young and beautiful. If your face would grow a little fuller
                        and those lines would go away, you&apos;d be lovely!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You little pig!&quot; laughed Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Anyone
                        would think you would be satisfied with having a splinter new mother,
                        without setting up a kick on her looks, first thing. Greedy!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-274" n="265"/>
                    <p>&quot;That is a good word,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I admit the
                        charge. I am greedy over every wasted year. I want you young, lovely,
                        prettily dressed and enjoying life like the other girls&apos;
                        mothers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock laughed softly as she pushed back her sunbonnet so that shrubs
                        and bushes along the way could be scanned closely. Elnora walked ahead with
                        a case over her shoulder, a net in her hand. Her head was bare, the rolling
                        collar of her lavender gingham dress was cut in a V at the throat, the
                        sleeves only reached the elbows. Every few steps she paused and examined the
                        shrubbery carefully, while Mrs. Comstock was watching until her eyes ached,
                        but there were no dandelions in the pail she carried.</p>
                    <p>Early June was rioting in fresh grasses, bright flowers, bird songs, and
                        gay-winged creatures of air. Down the footpath the two went through the
                        perfect morning, the love of God and all nature in their hearts. At last
                        they reached the creek, following it toward the bridge. Here Mrs. Comstock
                        found a large bed of tender dandelions and stopped to fill her pail. Then
                        she sat on the bank, picking over the greens, while she listened to the
                        creek softly singing its June song.</p>
                    <p>Elnora remained within calling distance, and was having good success. At last
                        she crossed the creek, following it up to a bridge. There she began a
                        careful examination of the under sides of the sleepers and flooring for
                        cocoons. Mrs. Comstock could see her and the creek for several rods above.
                        The mother sat beating the long <pb id="VAA2373-275" n="266"/> green leaves
                        across her hand, carefully picking out the white buds, because Elnora liked
                        them, when a splash up the creek attracted her attention.</p>
                    <p>Around the bend came a man. He was bareheaded, dressed in a white sweater,
                        and waders which reached his waist. He kept on the bank, only entering the
                        water when necessary. He had a queer basket strapped on his hip, and with a
                        small rod he sent a long line spinning before him down the creek, deftly
                        manipulating with it a little floating object. He was nearer Elnora than her
                        mother, but Mrs. Comstock thought possibly by hurrying she could remain
                        unseen and yet warn the girl that a stranger was coming. Thrusting the
                        greens into the pail she ran down the creek bank. As she neared the bridge,
                        she caught a sapling and leaned over the water to call Elnora. With her lips
                        parted to speak, she hesitated a second to watch a sort of insect that
                        flashed past on the water, when a splash from the man attracted the girl.</p>
                    <p>She was under the bridge, one knee planted in the embankment and a foot
                        braced to support her. Her hair was tousled by wind and bushes, her face
                        flushed, and she lifted her arms above her head, working to loosen a cocoon
                        she had found. The call Mrs. Comstock had intended to utter never found
                        voice, for as Elnora looked down at the sound, &quot;Possibly I could
                        get that for you,&quot; suggested the man.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock drew back. He was a young man with a wonderfully attractive
                        face, although it was too <pb id="VAA2373-276" n="267"/> white for robust
                        health, broad shoulders, and slender upright frame.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I do hope you can!&quot; answered Elnora.
                        &quot;It&apos;s quite a find! It&apos;s one of those lovely pale
                        red cocoons described in the books. I suspect it comes from having been in a
                        dark place and screened from the weather.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that so?&quot; cried the man. &quot;Wait a minute.
                        I&apos;ve never seen one. I suppose it&apos;s a Cecropia, from the
                        location.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;It&apos;s so cool
                        here the moth hasn&apos;t emerged. The cocoon is a big, baggy one, and
                        it is as red as fox tail.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What luck!&quot; he cried. &quot;Are you making a
                        collection?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He reeled in his line, laid his rod across a bush and climbed the embankment
                        to Elnora&apos;s side, produced a knife and began the work of whittling
                        a deep groove around the cocoon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I paid my way through the high school in Onabasha with them.
                        Now I am starting a collection which means college.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Onabasha!&quot; said the man. &quot;That is where I am
                        visiting.&quot; He paused to rest, for the bridge flooring was hard
                        lumber, and the task he had set himself not easy. &quot;Possibly you
                        know my peopleDr. Ammon&apos;s? The doctor is my uncle. My home is in
                        Chicago. I&apos;ve been having typhoid fever, something fierce. In the
                        hospital six weeks. Didn&apos;t gain strength right, so Uncle Doc sent
                        for me. I am to live out of doors all summer, <pb id="VAA2373-277" n="268"/>
                        and exercise until I get in condition again. Do you know my uncle?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. He is Aunt Margaret&apos;s doctor, and he would be ours,
                        only we are never ill.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you look it!&quot; said the man, appraising Elnora at a
                        glance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Strangers always mention it,&quot; sighed Elnora. &quot;I
                        wonder how it would feel to be a pale languid lady and ride in a
                        carriage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ask me!&quot; laughed the man. &quot;It feels like
                        thedickens! I&apos;m so proud of my feet. It&apos;s quite a trick to
                        stand on them now. I have to keep out of the water all I can and stop to
                        baby every half-mile. But with interesting outdoor work I&apos;ll be
                        myself in a week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you call that work?&quot; Elnora indicated the creek.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do, indeed! Nearly three miles, banks too soft to brag on and
                        never a strike. Wouldn&apos;t you call that hard labour?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; laughed Elnora. &quot;Work at which you might
                        kill yourself and never get a fish. Did anyone tell you there were trout in
                        Sleepy Snake Creek?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Uncle said I could try.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you can,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;You can try no end,
                        but you&apos;ll never get a trout. This is too far south and too warm
                        for them. If you sit on the bank and use worms you might get some perch or
                        catfish.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But that isn&apos;t exercise.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if you only want exercise, go right on fishing. You can get a
                        creel full of invisible results every night.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-278" n="269"/>
                    <p>&quot;I object,&quot; said the man emphatically. He stopped work
                        again and studied Elnora. Even the watching mother could not blame him.
                        Against the embankment, in the shade of the bridge Elnora&apos;s bright
                        head, and her lavender dress made a picture worthy of much contemplation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I object!&quot; repeated the man. &quot;When I work I want
                        to see results. I&apos;d rather exercise sawing wood, making one pile
                        grow little and the other big, than to cast all day and catch nothing
                        because there is not a fish to take. Work for work&apos;s sake
                        don&apos;t appeal to me. I work for results.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He digged the groove around the cocoon with skilled hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now there is some fun in this!&quot; he said.
                        &quot;It&apos;s going to be a fair job to cut it out, but when it
                        comes, it is not only beautiful, but worth a price; it will help you on your
                        way. I think I&apos;ll put up that rod and hunt moths. That would be
                        something like! Don&apos;t you want help?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora parried the question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever hunted moths, Mr. Ammon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Enough to know the ropes in taking them, and to distinguish the
                        commonest ones. I go wild on Catocal. There&apos;s too many of them, all
                        too much alike for Philip, but I know all these fellows. One flew into my
                        room when I was about ten years old, and we thought it a miracle. None of us
                        ever had seen one so we took it over to the museum to Dr. Dorsey. He said
                        they were common enough, but we didn&apos;t see them <pb
                            id="VAA2373-279" n="270"/> because they flew at night. He showed me the
                        museum collection, and I was so interested I took mine back home and started
                        to hunt them. Every year after that we went to our cottage a month earlier,
                        so I could find them, and all my family helped. I stuck to it until I went
                        to college. Then, keeping the little moths out of the big ones was too much
                        for the mater, so father advised that I donate mine to the museum. He bought
                        a fine case for them with my name on it, which constitutes my sole
                        contribution to science. I know enough to help you all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you going north this year?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All depends on how this fever leaves me. Uncle says the nights are
                        too cold and the days too hot there for me. He thinks I had better stay in
                        an even temperature until I am strong again. I am going to stick pretty
                        close to him until I know I am. I wouldn&apos;t admit it to anyone at
                        home, but I was almost gone. I don&apos;t believe anything can eat up
                        nerve much faster than the burning of a slow fever. No, thanks, I have
                        enough. I stay with Uncle Doc, so if I feel it coming again he can do
                        something quickly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t blame you,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I
                        never have been sick, but it must be dreadful. I am afraid you are tiring
                        yourself over that. Let me take the knife awhile.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it isn&apos;t so bad as that! I wouldn&apos;t be wading
                        creeks if it were. I just need a few more days to get steady on my feet
                        again. I&apos;ll have this cut out in a minute.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-280" n="271"/>
                    <p>&quot;It is kind of you to get it,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I
                        should have had to peel it, which would spoil the cocoon, for a specimen and
                        ruin the moth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t said yet whether I may help you while I am
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora hesitated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You better say &quot;yes,&quot;&apos; he persisted.
                        &quot;It would be a real kindness. It would keep me out doors all day
                        and give an incentive to work. I&apos;m good at it. I&apos;ll show
                        you if I am not in a week or so. I can &quot;sugar,&apos; manipulate
                        lights, and mirrors, and all the expert methods. I&apos;ll wager moths
                        are thick in the old swamp over there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Most I have I took
                        there. A few nights ago my mother caught a good many, but we don&apos;t
                        dare go alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All the more reason why you need me. Where do you live? I
                        can&apos;t get an answer from you, I&apos;ll just go tell your
                        mother who I am and ask her if I may help you. I warn you, young lady, I
                        have a very effective way with mothers. They almost never turn me
                        down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then it&apos;s probable you will have a new experience when you
                        meet mine,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;She never was known to do what
                        anyone expected she surely would.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The cocoon came loose. Philip Ammon stepped down the embankment turning to
                        offer his hand to Elnora. She ran down as she would have done alone, and
                        taking the cocoon turned it end for end to learn if the imago it contained
                        was alive. Then Ammon took back the cocoon to smooth the edges. Mrs.
                        Comstock <pb id="VAA2373-281" n="272"/> gave them one long look as they
                        stood there, and returned to her dandelions. She began the cleaning process
                        all over again. While she worked she paused occasionally, listening
                        intently. Presently they came down the creek, the man carrying the cocoon as
                        if it were a jewel, while Elnora made her way along the bank, taking a
                        lesson in casting. Her face was flushed with excitement, her eyes shining,
                        the bushes taking liberties with her hair. For a picture of perfect
                        loveliness she scarcely could have been surpassed, and the eyes of Philip
                        Ammon seemed to be in working order.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Moth-er!&quot; called Elnora.</p>
                    <p>There was an undulent, caressing sweetness in the girl&apos;s voice, as
                        she sung out the call in perfect confidence that it would bring a loving
                        answer, that struck deep in Mrs. Comstock&apos;s heart. She never had
                        heard that word so pronounced before and a lump rose in her throat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here!&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>She went on examining the dandelion leaves.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother, this is Mr. Philip Ammon, of Chicago,&quot; said
                        Elnora. &quot;He has been ill and he is staying with Dr. Ammon in
                        Onabasha. He came fishing down the creek and cut this cocoon from under the
                        bridge for me. He feels that it would be better to hunt moths than to fish,
                        until he gets well. What do you think about it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip Ammon extended his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad to know you,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may take the hand-shaking for granted,&quot; replied Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;Dandelions have a way of making <pb id="VAA2373-282"
                            n="273"/> the fingers sticky, and I like to know a man before I take his
                        hand, anyway. That introduction seems mighty comprehensive on your part, but
                        it still leaves me unclassified. My name is Comstock.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip bowed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sorry to hear you have been sick,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;But if people will live where they have such vile water
                        as they do in Chicago, I don&apos;t see what else they are to
                        expect.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammoti studied her intently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sure I didn&apos;t have a fever on purpose,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do seem a little wobbly on your legs,&quot; she observed.
                        &quot;Maybe you had better sit and rest while I finish these greens.
                        It&apos;s late for the genuine article, but in the shade, among long
                        grass they are still tender.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;May I have a leaf?&quot; asked Ammon reaching for one as he sat
                        on the bank, looking from the little creek at his feet, away through the dim
                        cool spaces of the June forest on the opposite side. He drew a deep breath.
                        &quot;Glory, but this is good after almost two months inside hospital
                        walls!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stretched on the grass and lay gazing up at the leaves, occasionally
                        asking the interpretation of a bird note or the origin of an unfamiliar
                        forest voice. Elnora began helping with the dandelions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Another, please,&quot; said the young man, holding out his
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you suppose this is the kind of grass Nebuchadnezzar
                        ate?&quot; she asked, giving the leaf.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-283" n="274"/>
                    <p>&quot;He knew a good thing if it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you should taste dandelions boiled with bacon and accompanied
                        by mother&apos;s especial brand of cornbread.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t! My appetite is twice my size now. While it ishow
                        far is it to Onabasha, shortest cut?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Three miles.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The man lay in perfect content, nibbling leaves.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This surely is a treat,&quot; he said. &quot;No wonder you
                        find good hunting here. There seems to be foliage for almost every kind of
                        caterpillar. But I suppose you have to exchange for northern species and
                        Pacific Coast kinds?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. And everyone wants Regalis in trade. I never saw the like.
                        They consider a Cecropia or a Polyphemus an insult, and a Luna is barely
                        acceptable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What authorities have you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora began to name text-books which started a discussion. Mrs. Comstock
                        listened. She cleaned dandelions with greater deliberation than they ever
                        before were examined. In reality she was taking stock of the young
                        man&apos;s long, well-proportioned frame, his strong hands, his smooth,
                        fine-textured skin, his thick shock of dark hair, and making mental notes of
                        his simple manly speech and the fact that he evidently did know a great deal
                        about moths. It pleased her to think that if he had been a neighbour boy who
                        had lain beside her every day of his life while she worked, he could have
                        been no more at home. She liked the things he said, but she <pb
                            id="VAA2373-284" n="275"/> was proud that Elnora had a ready answer
                        which always seemed appropriate.</p>
                    <p>At last Mrs. Comstock finished the greens.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are three miles from the city and less than a mile from where
                        we live,&quot; she said. &quot;If you will tell me what you dare
                        eat, I suspect you had best go home with us and rest until the cool of the
                        day before you start back. Probably some one that you can ride in with will
                        be passing before evening.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is mighty kind of you,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I
                        think I will. It dont matter so much what I eat, the point is that I must be
                        moderate. I am hungry all the time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then we will go,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock, &quot;and we
                        will not allow you to make yourself sick with us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip Ammon was on his feet. Picking up the pail of greens and his fishing
                        rod he stood waiting. Elnora led the way. Mrs. Comstock motioned Philip to
                        follow and she walked in the rear. The girl carried the cocoon and the box
                        of moths she had taken, searching every step for more. The young man
                        frequently set down his load to join in the pursuit of a dragon fly or moth,
                        while Mrs. Comstock watched the proceedings with sharp eyes. Every time
                        Philip picked up the pail of greens she struggled to suppress a smile.</p>
                    <p>Elnora proceeded slowly chattering about everything along the trail. Philip
                        was interested in all the objects she pointed out, noticing several things
                        which escaped her. He carried the greens just as casually when they took a
                        short cut down the roadway as along the trail.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-285" n="276"/>
                    <p>When Elnora turned toward the gate of her home Philip Ammon stopped, took a
                        long look at the big hewed log cabin, the vines which clambered over it, the
                        flower garden ablaze with beds of bright bloom interspersed with
                        strawberries and tomatoes, the trees of the forest rising north and west
                        like a green wall and exclaimed, &quot;How beautiful!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock was pleased. &quot;If you think that,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;perhaps you will understand, how in all this present-day rush to
                        be modern, I have preferred to remain as I began. My husband and I took up
                        this land, and enough trees to build the cabin, stable, and out buildings
                        are about all we ever cut. Of course, if he had lived, I suppose we should
                        have kept with our neighbours. I hear considerable about the value of the
                        land, the trees which are on it, and the oil which is supposed to be under
                        it, but, as yet I haven&apos;t brought myself to change any thing. So we
                        stand for one of the few remaining homes of first settlers in this region.
                        Come in. You are very welcome to what we have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock stepped forward and took the lead. She had a bowl of soft water
                        and a pair of boots to offer for the heavy waders, for outer comfort, a
                        glass of cold buttermilk and a bench on which to rest, in the circular
                        arbour until dinner was ready. Philip Ammon splashed in the water. He
                        followed to the stable and exchanged boots there. He was ravenous for the
                        buttermilk, and when he stretched on the bench in the arbour the flickering
                        patches of sunlight so tantalized his tired eyes, while <pb id="VAA2373-286"
                            n="277"/> the bees made such splendid music, he was soon sound asleep.</p>
                    <p>When Elnora and her mother came out with a table they stood a short time
                        looking at him. It is probable Mrs. Comstock voiced a united thought when
                        she said, &quot;What a refined, decent looking young man! How proud his
                        mother must be of him! We must be careful what we let him eat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then they returned to the kitchen where Mrs. Comstock proceeded to be
                        careful. She broiled ham of her own sugar-curing, creamed potatoes, served
                        asparagus on toast, and made a delicious strawberry shortcake. As she cooked
                        dandelions with bacon, she feared to serve them to him, so she made an
                        excuse that it took too long to prepare them, blanched some and made a
                        salad. When everything was ready she touched Ammon&apos;s sleeve.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Best have something to eat, lad, before you get too
                        hungry,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please, hurry!&quot; he begged laughingly as he held a plate
                        toward her to be filled. &quot;I thoughtI had enough self-restraint to
                        start out alone, but I see I was mistaken. If you would allow me, just now,
                        I am afraid I should start a fever again. I never did smell food so good as
                        this. It&apos;s mighty kind of you to take me in. I hope I will be man
                        enough in a few days to do something worth while in return.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Spots of sunshine fell on the white cloth and blue china, the bees and an
                        occasional stray butterfly came searching for food. A rose-breasted
                        grosbeak, released from a <pb id="VAA2373-287" n="278"/> three
                        hours&apos; siege of brooding, while his independent mate took her bath
                        and recreation, mounted the top branch of a maple in the west woods from
                        which he serenaded the dinner party with a joyful chorus in celebration of
                        his freedom. Ammon&apos;s eyes strayed to the beautiful cabin, to the
                        mixture of flowers and vegetables stretching down to the road, and to the
                        singing bird with his red-splotched breast of white and he said, &quot;I
                        can&apos;t realize now that I ever lay in ice packs in a hospital. How I
                        wish all the sick folks could come here to grow strong!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The grosbeak sang on, a big Turnus butterfly sailed through the arbour and
                        poised over the table. Elnora held up a lump of sugar and the butterfly,
                        clinging to her fingers, tasted daintily. With eager eyes and parted lips,
                        the girl held steadily. When at last it wavered away, &quot;That made a
                        picture!&quot; said Ammon. &quot;Ask me some other time how I lost
                        my illusions concerning butterflies. I always thought of them in connection
                        with sunshine, flower pollen, and fruit nectar, until one sad day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know!&quot; laughed Elnora. &quot;I&apos;ve seen
                        that, too, but it didn&apos;t destroy any illusion for me. I think just
                        as much of the butterflies as ever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then they talked of flowers, moths, dragon flies, Indian relics, and all the
                        natural wonders the swamp afforded, straying from those subjects to books
                        and school work. When they cleared the table Ammon assisted, carrying
                        several tray loads to the kitchen. He <pb id="VAA2373-288" n="279"/> and
                        Elnora mounted specimens while Mrs. Comstock washed the dishes. Then she
                        came out with a ruffle she was embroidering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder if I did not see a picture of you in Onabasha, last
                        night,&quot; Ammon said to Elnora. &quot;Aunt Anna took me to call
                        on Miss Brownlee. She was showing me her crowdof course, it was you! But it
                        didn&apos;t half do you justice, although it looked the nearest human of
                        any of them. Miss Brownlee is very fond of you. She said the finest
                        things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then they talked of Commencement, and at last Ammon said he must go or his
                        friends would become anxious about him.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock brought him a blue bowl of creamy milk and a plate of bread.
                        She stopped a passing team and secured a ride to the city for him, as his
                        exercise of the morning had been a little too violent, and he was forced to
                        admit he was tired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;May I come to-morrow afternoon and chase moths awhile?&quot; he
                        asked Mrs. Comstock as he arose. &quot;We will &quot;sugar&apos;
                        a tree and put a light by it, if I can get stuff to make the preparation.
                        Possibly we can take some that way. I always enjoy moth hunting,
                        I&apos;d like to help Miss Elnora, and it would be a charity to me.
                        I&apos;ve got to remain outdoors some place, and I&apos;m quite sure
                        I&apos;d get well faster here than anywhere else. Please say I may
                        come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have no objections, if Elnora really would like help,&quot;
                        said Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-289" n="280"/>
                    <p>In her heart she wished he would not. She wanted her newly found treasure all
                        to herself, for a time, at least. But Elnora&apos;s were eager, shining
                        eyes. She thought it would be splendid to have help, and great fun to try
                        book methods for taking moths, so it was arranged. As Ammon rode away, Mrs.
                        Comstock&apos;s eyes followed him. &quot;What a nice young
                        man!&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He seems fine,&quot; agreed Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He comes of a good family, too. I&apos;ve often heard of his
                        father. He is a great lawyer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad he likes it here. I need help. Possibly&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Possibly what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We can get a great many moths.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did he mean about the butterflies?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That he always had connected them with sunshine, flowers, and
                        fruits, and thought of them as the most exquisite of creations; then one day
                        he found some clustering thickly over carrion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come to think of it, I have seen butterflies&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So had he,&quot; laughed Elnora, &quot;and that is what he
                        meant.&quot;</p>

                        She tore it open and read: <text>

                                    <p>At the weekly meeting of the Onabasha School Board last
                                        night, it was decided to add the position of Lecturer on
                                        Natural History to our corps of city teachers. It will be
                                        the duty of this person to spend two hours a week in each of
                                        the grade schools exhibiting and explaining specimens of the
                                        most prominent objects in nature; animals, birds, insects,
                                        flowers, vines, shrubs, bushes, and trees. These specimens
                                        and lectures should be appropriate to the seasons and the
                                        comprehension of the grades. This position was unanimously
                                        voted to you. I think you will find the work delightful and
                                        much easier than the routine grind of the other teachers. It
                                        is my advice that you accept and begin to prepare yourself
                                        at once. Your salary will be $750 a year, and you will be
                                        allowed $200 for expenses in procuring specimens and books.
                                        Let us know at once if you want the position, as it is going
                                        to be difficult to fill satisfactorily if you do not.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;I hardly understand,&quot; marvelled Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is a new position. They never have had anything like it before.
                        I suspect it arose from the help I&apos;ve <pb id="VAA2373-291" n="282"
                        /> been giving the grade teachers in their nature work. They are trying to
                        teach the children something, and half the instructors don&apos;t know a
                        blue jay from a kingfisher, a beech leaf from an elm, or a wasp from a
                        hornet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, do you?&quot; anxiously inquired Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed, I do!&quot; laughed Elnora, &quot;and several other
                        things beside. When Freckles bequeathed me the swamp, he gave me a bigger
                        inheritance than he knew. While you have thought I was wandering aimlessly,
                        I have been following a definite plan, studying hard, and storing up the
                        stuff that will earn these seven hundred and fifty dollars. Mother, dear, I
                        am going to accept this, of course. The work will be a delight. I&apos;d
                        love it most of anything in teaching. You must help me. We must find nests,
                        eggs, leaves, queer formations in plants and rare flowers. I must have
                        flower boxes made for each of the rooms and filled with wild things. I
                        should begin to gather specimens this very day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora was on her feet. Her face was flushed and her eyes bright.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, what great work that will be!&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;You must go with me so you can see the little faces when I tell
                        them how the goldfinch builds its nest, and how the bees make
                        honey.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So Elnora and her mother went into the woods behind the cabin to study
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;the idea is to begin with
                        fall things in the fall, keeping to the seasons throughout the
                        year.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-292" n="283"/>
                    <p>&quot;What are fall things?&quot; inquired Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, fringed gentians, asters, ironwort, every fall flower, leaves
                        from every tree and vine, what makes them change colour, abandoned bird
                        nests, winter quarters of caterpillars and insects, what becomes of the
                        butterflies and grasshoppersjust myriads of stuff. I never can use the half
                        there will be to show. I shall have to be very wise to select the things it
                        will be most beneficial for the children to learn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can I really help you?&quot; Mrs. Comstock&apos;s strong
                        face was pathetic.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed, yes!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;I never can get
                        through it alone. There will be an immense amount of work connected with
                        securing and preparing specimens.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock lifted her head proudly and began doing business at once. Her
                        sharp eyes ranged from earth to heaven. She investigated everything asking
                        innumerable questions. By noon she was as eager and interested as Elnora.
                        The morning was filled with happiness for both of them. Near noon Mrs.
                        Comstock took the specimens they had collected, and went to prepare dinner,
                        while Elnora followed the woods down to Sintons&apos; to show letter.</p>
                    <p>She had to explain what became of her moths, and why college would have to be
                        abandoned for that year, but Margaret and Wesley vowed not to tell. Wesley
                        waved the letter excitedly, explaining it to Margaret as if it was a
                        personal possession. Margaret was deeply impressed, while Billy volunteered
                        first aid in gathering material.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-293" n="284"/>
                    <p>&quot;Now, anything you want in the ground, Snap can dig it
                        out,&quot; he said. &quot;Uncle Wesley and I found a hole three
                        times as big as Snap, that he dug at the roots of a tree.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will train him to hunt pupae cases,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you going to the woods this afternoon?&quot; asked Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;Dr. Ammon&apos;s
                        nephew from Chicago is visiting in Onabasha. He is going to show me how men
                        put some sort of compound on a tree, hang a light by it, and take moths that
                        way. It will be interesting to watch and learn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;May I come?&quot; asked Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, you may come!&quot; answered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is this nephew of Dr. Ammon a young man?&quot; inquired
                        Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;About twenty-six, I should think,&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;He said he had been out of college and at work in his
                        father&apos;s law office three years.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does he seem nice?&quot; asked Margaret, and Wesley smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Finest kind of a person,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;He can
                        teach me so much. It is very interesting to hear him talk. He knows
                        considerable about moths that will be a help to me. He had a fever and he
                        has to stay outdoors until he grows strong again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy, I guess you better help me this afternoon,&quot; said
                        Margaret. &quot;Maybe Elnora had rather not bother with you.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-294" n="285"/>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s no reason on earth why Billy should not
                        come!&quot; cried Elnora, and Wesley smiled again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must hurry home and get my dinner or I won&apos;t be
                        ready,&quot; she added.</p>
                    <p>Hastening down the road with glowing face she entered the cabin.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you never would come,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;If you don&apos;t hurry Mr. Ammon will be here before you get
                        dressed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I forgot about him until just now,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not going to dress. He&apos;s not coming to visit. We are
                        only going to the woods for more specimens. I can&apos;t wear anything
                        that requires care. The limbs take the most dreadful liberties with hair and
                        clothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock opened her lips, looked at Elnora and closed them. In her heart
                        she was pleased that the girl was so interested in her work that she had
                        forgotten Philip Ammon&apos;s coming. But it did seem to her that such a
                        pleasant young man should have been greeted by a girl in a fresh dress.
                        &quot;If she isn&apos;t disposed to primp at the coming of a man,
                        heaven forbid that I should be the one to start her,&quot; thought Mrs.
                        Comstock. So she did the primping in honour of the occasion. It consisted of
                        a fresh gingham dress and hair coiled a little more loosely than usual.</p>
                    <p>Ammon came whistling down the walk between the cinnamon pinks, pansies, and
                        strawberries. He carried several packages, while his face flushed with more
                        colour than on the previous day.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-295" n="286"/>
                    <p>&quot;Only see what has happened to me!&quot; cried Elnora, offering
                        her letter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll wager I know!&quot; answered Ammon.
                        &quot;Isn&apos;t it great! Everyone in Onabasha is talking about it.
                        At last there is something new under the sun. All of them are pleased. They
                        think you&apos;ll make a big success. This will give an incentive to
                        work. In a few days more I&apos;ll be myself again, and we&apos;ll
                        overturn the fields and woods around here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went on to congratulate Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you proud of her, though?&quot; he asked.
                        &quot;You should hear what folks are saying! They say she created the
                        necessity for the position, and everyone seems to feel that it is a
                        necessity. Now, if she succeeds, and she will, all of the other city schools
                        will have such departments, and first thing you know she will have made the
                        whole world just a little better. Let me rest a few seconds; my feet are
                        acting up again. Then we will cook the compound and put it to
                        cool.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed as he sat breathing shortly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t seem possible that a fellow could lose his
                        strength like this. My knees are actually trembling, but I&apos;ll be
                        all right in a minute. Uncle Doc said I could come. I told him how you took
                        care of me, and he said I would be safe here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he began unwrapping packages and explaining to Mrs. Comstock how to cook
                        the compound to attract the moths. He followed her into the kitchen, kindled
                        the fire, and stirred the preparation as he talked. While <pb
                            id="VAA2373-296" n="287"/> the mixture cooled, he and Elnora walked
                        through the vegetable garden behind the cabin and strayed from there into
                        the woods.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What about college?&quot; he asked. &quot;Miss Brownlee
                        said you were going.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had hoped to,&quot; replied Elnora, &quot;but I had a
                        streak of dreadful luck, so I&apos;ll have to wait until next year. If
                        you won&apos;t speak of it I&apos;ll tell you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon promised, and Elnora recited the history of the yellow Emperor. She was
                        so interested in doing the Emperor justice she did not notice how many
                        personalities went into the story. A few pertinent questions told Ammon the
                        rest. He looked at the girl in wonder. In face and form she was as lovely as
                        any one of her age and type he ever had seen. Her school work far surpassed
                        that of most girls of her age he knew. She differed in other ways. This vast
                        store of learning she had gathered from field and forest was a wealth of
                        attraction no other girl possessed. Her frank, matter-of-fact manner was an
                        inheritance from her mother, but there was something more. Once, as they
                        talked he thought &quot;sympathy&quot; was the word to describe it
                        and again &quot;comprehension.&quot; She seemed to possess a large
                        sense of brotherhood for all human and animate creatures. She spoke to him
                        as if she had known him all her life. She talked to the grosbeak in exactly
                        the same manner, as she laid strawberries and potato bugs on the fence for
                        his family. She did not swerve an inch from her way when a snake slid by
                        her, while the squirrels <pb id="VAA2373-297" n="288"/> came down from the
                        trees and took corn from her fingers. She might as well have been a boy, so
                        lacking was she in any touch of feminine coquetry toward him. He studied her
                        wonderingly.</p>
                    <p>As they went along the path they reached a large slimecovered pool surrounded
                        by decaying stumps and logs thickly covered with water hyacinths and blue
                        flags. Ammon stopped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that the place?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>Elnora assented.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The doctor told you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. It was tragic. Is that pool really bottomless?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So far as we ever have been able to discover.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon stood looking at the water, while the long, sweet grasses, thickly
                        sprinkled with blue flag bloom, over which wild bees clambered, swayed
                        around his feet. Then he turned to the girl. She had worked hard. The same
                        lavender dress she had worn the previous day clung to her in limp condition.
                        But she was as evenly coloured and of as fine grain as a wild rose petal,
                        her hair was really brown, but never was such hair touched with a redder
                        glory, while her heavy arching brows added a look of strength to her big
                        gray-blue eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you were born here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had not intended to voice that thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said looking into his eyes. &quot;Just in
                        time to prevent my mother from saving the life of my father. She came near
                        never forgiving me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, cruel!&quot; cried Ammon.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-298" n="289"/>
                    <p>&quot;I find a great deal in life that is cruel, from our
                        standpoints,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;It takes the large wisdom of
                        the Unfathomable, the philosophy of the Almighty, to bear some of it. But
                        there is always right somewhere, and at last it seems to come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will it come to you?&quot; asked Ammon, who found himself
                        suffering intensely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It has come,&quot; said the girl serenely. &quot;It came a
                        week ago. It came in fullest measure when my mother ceased to regret that I
                        had been born. Now, work that I love has comethat should constitute
                        happiness.</p>
                    <p>A little farther along is my violet bed. I want you to see it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As Philip Ammon followed he definitely settled upon the name of the unusual
                        feature of Elnora&apos;s face. It should be called
                        &quot;experience.&quot; She had known hard experiences early in
                        life. Suffering had been her familiar more than joy. He watched her with
                        intense earnestness, his heart deeply moved. She led him into a swampy
                        half-open space in the woods, stopped and stepped aside. Ammon uttered a cry
                        of surprised delight.</p>
                    <p>A few decaying logs were scattered around, the grass grew in tufts long and
                        fine. Blue flags waved, clusters of cowslips nodded gold heads, but the
                        whole earth was purple with a thick blanket of violets nodding from stems a
                        foot in length. Elnora knelt and slipping her fingers through the leaves and
                        grasses to the roots, gathered a few violets and gave them to Philip.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can your city greenhouses surpass them?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-299" n="290"/>
                    <p>Ammon sat on a log to examine the blooms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are superb!&quot; he said. &quot;I never saw such
                        length of stem or such rank leaves, while the flowers are the deepest blue,
                        the truest violet I ever saw growing wild. They are coloured exactly like
                        the eyes of the girl I am going to marry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora handed him several others to add to those he held.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She must have wonderful eyes,&quot; she commented.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No other blue eyes are quite so beautiful,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In fact, she is altogether lovely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is customary for a man to think the girl he is going to marry
                        lovely. I wonder if I should find her so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You would,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;No one ever fails to.
                        She is tall as you, very slender, but perfectly rounded; you know about her
                        eyes; her hair is black and wavywhile her complexion is clear and flushed
                        with red.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora knelt among the flowers as she looked at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, she must be the most beautiful girl in the whole
                        world!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>Ammon laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, indeed!&quot; he said. &quot;She is not a particle
                        better looking in her way than you are in yours. She is a type of dark
                        beauty, but you are just as perfect. She is unusual in her combination of
                        black hair and violet eyes, although everyone thinks them black at a little
                        distance. You are quite as unusual with your <pb id="VAA2373-300" n="291"/>
                        fair face, black brows and brown hair; indeed, I know many people who would
                        prefer your bright head to her dark one. It&apos;s all a question of
                        tasteand being engaged to the girl,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That would be likely to prejudice one,&quot; laughed Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith has a birthday soon; if these last will you let me have a box
                        of them to send her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will help gather and pack them for you, so they will carry
                        nicely. Does she hunt moths with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Back went Philip Ammon&apos;s head in a gale of laughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot; he cried. &quot;She says they are
                        &quot;creepy.&apos; She would scream herself into a spasm if she
                        were compelled to touch those young caterpillars I saw you handling
                        yesterday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why would she?&quot; marvelled Elnora.
                        &quot;Haven&apos;t you told her that they are perfectly clean,
                        helpless, and harmless as so much animate velvet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I have not told her. She wouldn&apos;t care enough about
                        caterpillars to listen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In what is she interested?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What interests Edith Carr? Let me think! First, I believe she takes
                        pride in being just a little handsomer and better dressed than any girl of
                        her set. She is interested in having a beautiful home, fine appointments
                        about her, in being petted, praised, and the acknowledged leader of society.
                        She likes to find new things which amuse her, and to always and in all
                        circumstances have her own way about everything.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-301" n="292"/>
                    <p>&quot;Good gracious!&quot; cried Elnora, staring at him.
                        &quot;But what does she do? How does she spend her time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Spend her time!&apos;&quot; repeated Ammon.
                        &quot;Well, she would call that a joke. Her days are never long enough.
                        There is endless shopping, to find the pretty things; regular visits to the
                        dressmakers, calls, parties, theatres, entertainments. She is always rushed.
                        I never get to see half as much of her as I would like.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I mean work,&quot; persisted Elnora. &quot;In what is
                        she interested that is useful to the world?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Me!&quot; cried Ammon promptly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can understand that,&quot; laughed Elnora. &quot;What I
                        can&apos;t understand is how you can be in&quot; She stopped short
                        in confusion, but she saw that he had finished the sentence as she had
                        intended. &quot;I beg your pardon!&quot; she cried. &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t mean to say that. But I cannot understand these people I
                        hear about who live only for their own amusement. Perhaps it is very great;
                        I&apos;ll never have a chance to know. To me, it seems the only pleasure
                        in this world worth having is the joy we get out of living for those we
                        love, and those we can help. I hope you are not angry with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon sat silently looking far away, with deep thought in his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are angry,&quot; faltered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>His look came back to her as she knelt before him among the flowers and he
                        gazed at her steadily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No doubt I should be,&quot; he said, &quot;but the fact is
                        I am not. I cannot understand a life purely for personal <pb
                            id="VAA2373-302" n="293"/> pleasure myself. But she is only a girl, and
                        this is her playtime. When she is a woman in her own home, then she will be
                        different, will she not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora never resembled her mother so closely as when she answered that
                        question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would have to be well acquainted with her to know, but I should
                        hope so. To make a real home for a tired business man is a very different
                        kind of work from that required to be a leader of society. It demands
                        different talent and education. Of course, she means to change, or she would
                        not have promised to make a home for you. I suspect our dope is cool now,
                        let&apos;s go try for some butterflies.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As they went back along the path together Elnora talked of many things but
                        Ammon answered absently. Evidently he was thinking of something else. But
                        the moth bait recalled him and he was ready for work as they made their way
                        back to the woods. He wanted to try the Limberlost, but Elnora was firm
                        about keeping on home ground. She did not tell him that lights hung in the
                        swamp would be a signal to call up a band of men whose presence she dreaded.
                        So they set out, Ammon carrying the dope, Elnora the net, Billy and Mrs.
                        Comstock following with cyanide boxes and lanterns.</p>
                    <p>First they tried for butterflies and captured several fine ones with little
                        trouble. They also called swarms of ants, beetles, bees, and flies. When it
                        grew dusk, Mrs. Comstock and Ammon went to prepare supper. Elnora and Billy
                        remained until the butterflies went to <pb id="VAA2373-303" n="294"/> bed.
                        Then they lighted the lanterns, repainted the trees and followed the home
                        trail.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you &apos;spect you&apos;ll get just a lot of
                        moths?&quot; asked Billy, as he walked beside Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sure I hardly know,&quot; said the girl. &quot;This is
                        a new way for me. Perhaps they will come to the lights, but few moths eat;
                        and I have some doubt about those which the lights attract settling on the
                        right trees. Maybe the smell of that dope will draw them. Between us, Billy,
                        I think I like the old way best. If I can find a hidden moth, slip up and
                        catch it unawares, or take it in full flight, it&apos;s my captive, and
                        I can keep it until it dies naturally. But this way you seem to get it under
                        false pretences, it has no chance, and it will probably ruin its wings
                        struggling for freedom before morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, any moth ought to be proud to be taken anyway, by
                        you,&quot; said Billy. &quot;Just look what you do!. You can make
                        everybody love them. People even quit hating caterpillars when they see you
                        handle them and hear you tell all about them. You just must have some to
                        show people how they are. It&apos;s not like killing things to see if
                        you can, or because you want to eat them, the way most men kill birds. I
                        think it is right for you to take enough for collections, to show city
                        people, and to illustrate the Bird Woman&apos;s books. You go on and
                        take them! The moths don&apos;t care. They&apos;re glad to have you.
                        They like it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy, I see your future,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;We will
                        educate you and send you up to Mr. Ammon to make <pb id="VAA2373-304"
                            n="295"/> a great lawyer. You&apos;d beat the world as a special
                        pleader. You actually make me feel that I am doing the moths a kindness to
                        take them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And so you are!&quot; cried Billy. &quot;Why, just from
                        what you have taught them, Uncle Wesley and Aunt Margaret never think of
                        killing a caterpillar until they look whether it&apos;s the beautiful
                        June moth kind, or the horrid tent ones. That&apos;s what you can do.
                        You just go ahead!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy, you are a jewel!&quot; cried Elnora, throwing her arm
                        across his shoulders as they came down the path.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My, I was scared!&quot; said Billy with a deep breath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Scared?&quot; questioned Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir-ee! Aunt Margaret scared me. May I ask you a
                        question?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, you may!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that man going to be your beau?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy! No! What made you think such a thing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aunt Margaret said likely he would fall in love with you, and you
                        wouldn&apos;t want me around any more. Oh, but I was scared! It
                        isn&apos;t so, is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed, no!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am your beau, ain&apos;t I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Surely you are!&quot; said Elnora, tightening her arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do hope Aunt Kate has ginger cookies,&quot; said Billy with a
                        little skip of delight.</p>

                    <p>M<hi rend="sc">RS.</hi> C<hi rend="sc">OMSTOCK</hi> and Elnora were finishing
                        breakfast the next morning when they heard a cheery whistle down the road.
                        Elnora with surprised eyes looked at her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Could that be Mr. Ammon?&quot; she questioned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did not expect him so soon,&quot; commented Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>It was just sunrise, but the musician was Philip Ammon. He looked stronger
                        than yesterday.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope I am not too early,&quot; he said. &quot;I am
                        consumed with anxiety to learn if we have made a catch. If we have, we
                        should beat the birds to it. I promised Uncle Doc to put on my waders and
                        keep dry for a few days yet, when I go to the woods. Let &apos;s hurry!
                        I am afraid of crows. There might be a rare moth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sun was topping the Limberlost when they started. As they neared the
                        place Ammon stopped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now we must use great caution,&quot; he said. &quot;The
                        lights and the odours always attract numbers that don&apos;t settle on
                        the baited trees. Every bush, shrub, and limb may hide a specimen we
                        want.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-306" n="297"/>
                    <p>So they approached with much care.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is something, anyway!&quot; cried Ammon, who was leading
                        the way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are moths! I can see them!&quot; exulted Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Those you see are fast enough. It&apos;s the ones for which you
                        must search that will get away. The grasses are dripping, and I have boots,
                        so you look along the path while I take the outside,&quot; suggested
                        Ammon.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock wanted to hunt moths, but she was cimid about making a wrong
                        movement, so she wisely sat on a log and watched Ammon and Elnora to learn
                        how they proceeded. Back in the deep woods a hermit thrush was singing his
                        chant to the rising sun. Orioles were sowing the pure, sweet air with notes
                        of gold, poured out while on wing. The robins were only chirping now, for
                        their morning songs had awakened all the other birds an hour ago. Scolding
                        red-wings tilted on half the bushes. Excepting late species of haws, tree
                        bloom was almost gone, but wild flowers made the path border and all the
                        wood floor a riot of colour. Elnora, born among such scenes, worked eagerly,
                        but to the city man, shortly from a hospital, they seemed too good to miss.
                        He frequently stooped to examine a flower face, paused to listen intently to
                        the thrush or lifted his head to see the gold flash which accompanied the
                        oriole&apos;s trailing notes. So Elnora uttered the first cry, as she
                        softly lifted branches and peered among the grasses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My find!&quot; she called. &quot;Bring the box,
                        mother!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon came hurrying also. When they reached <pb id="VAA2373-307" n="298"/>
                        her she stood on the path holding a pair of moths. Her eyes were wide with
                        excitement, her cheeks pink, her red lips parted, and on the hand she held
                        out to them clung a pair of delicate blue-green moths, with white bodies,
                        and touches of lavender and straw colour. All about her lay flower-brocaded
                        grasses, behind the deep green background of the forest, while the sun
                        slowly sifted gold from heaven to burnish her hair. Mrs. Comstock heard a
                        sharp breath behind her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, what a picture!&quot; exulted Ammon at her shoulder.
                        &quot;She is absolutely and altogether lovely! I&apos;d give a small
                        fortune for that faithfully set on canvas!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He picked the box from Mrs. Comstock&apos;s fingers and slowly advanced
                        with it. Elnora held down her hand and transferred the moths. Ammon closed
                        the box carefully, but the watching mother saw that his eyes were following
                        the girl&apos;s face. He was not making the slightest attempt to conceal
                        what he felt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder if a woman ever did anything lovelier than to find a pair
                        of Luna moths on a forest path, early on a perfect June morning,&quot;
                        he said to Mrs. Comstock, as he returned the box.</p>
                    <p>She glanced at Elnora. The girl had gone back to work, and was intently
                        searching the bushes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here, young man,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;You
                        seem to find that girl of mine about right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could suggest no improvement,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I
                        never saw a more attractive girl anywhere. She seems absolutely perfect to
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-308" n="299"/>
                    <p>&quot;Then suppose you don&apos;t start any scheme calculated to
                        spoil her!&quot; suggested Mrs. Comstock dryly. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t think you can, or that any man could, but I&apos;m not
                        taking any risks. You asked to come here to help in this work. We are both
                        glad to have you, if you confine yourself to work; but it&apos;s the
                        least you can do to leave us as you find us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon!&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I intended no
                        offence. I admire her as I admire any perfect creation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And nothing in all this world spoils the average girl so quickly
                        and so surely,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. She raised her voice.
                        &quot;Elnora, fasten up that tag of hair over your left ear. These
                        bushes muss you so you remind me of a sheep poking its nose through a hedge
                        fence.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock started down the path toward her log again, and as she reached
                        it she called sharply, &quot;Elnora, come here! I believe I have found
                        something myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The &quot;something&quot; was a Citheronia Regalis which had just
                        emerged from its case on the soft earth by the log. It climbed up the wood,
                        its stout legs dragging a big pursy body, while it wildly flapped tiny wings
                        the size of a man&apos;s thumb-nail. Elnora gave one look and a cry
                        which brought Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the rarest moth in America!&quot; he announced.
                        &quot;Mrs. Comstock, you&apos;ve gone up head. You can put that in a
                        box with a screen cover to-night, and attract a half-dozen,
                        possibly.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-309" n="300"/>
                    <p>&quot;Is it rare, Elnora?&quot; inquired Mrs. Comstock, as if no one
                        else knew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It surely is,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;If we can find
                        it a mate to-night, it will lay from two hundred and fifty to three hundred
                        eggs to-morrow. With any luck at all I can raise two hundred caterpillars
                        from them. I did once before. And they are worth a dollar apiece.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was the one I killed like that?&quot; gasped Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. That was a different moth, but its life processes were the same
                        as this. The Bird Woman calls this the King of the Poets.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why does she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because it is named for Citheron who was a poet, and regalis refers
                        to king. You mustn&apos;t touch it or you may stunt wing development.
                        You watch and don&apos;t let that moth out of sight, or anything come
                        near it. When the wings are expanded and hardened we will put it in a
                        box.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am afraid it will race itself to death,&quot; objected Mrs.
                        Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a part of the game,&quot; said Ammon.
                        &quot;It is starting circulation now. When the right moment comes, it
                        will stop and develop its wings. If you watch closely you can see them
                        expand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Presently the moth found a rough projection of bark and clung with its feet,
                        back down, its wings hanging. The body was an unusual orange red, the tiny
                        wings were gray, striped with the red and splotched here and <pb
                            id="VAA2373-310" n="301"/> there with markings of canary yellow. Mrs.
                        Comstock watched breathlessly. Presently she slipped off the log and knelt
                        to get a better view.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are its wings growing?&quot; called Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are getting larger and the markings coming stronger every
                        minute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s watch, too,&quot; said Elnora to Ammon.</p>
                    <p>They came and looked over Mrs. Comstock&apos;s shoulder. Lower drooped
                        the gay wings, wider they spread, brighter grew the markings as if laid off
                        in geometrical patterns. They could hear Mrs. Comstock&apos;s tense
                        breath and see her absorbed expression.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Young people,&quot; she said solemnly, &quot;if your
                        studying science and the elements has ever led you to feel that things just
                        happen, kind of evolve by chance, as it were, this sight will be good for
                        you. Maybe earth and air accumulate, but it takes the wisdom of the Almighty
                        God to devise the wing of a moth. If there ever was a miracle, this whole
                        process is one. Now, as I understand it, this creature is going to keep on
                        spreading those wings, until they grow to size and harden to strength
                        sufficient to bear its body. Then it flies, away, mates with its kind, lays
                        its eggs on the leaves of a certain tree, and the eggs hatch tiny
                        caterpillars which eat just that kind of leaves, and the worms grow and
                        grow, and take on different forms and colours until at last they are big
                        caterpillars six inches long, with large horns. Then they burrow into the
                        earth, build a house around themselves from material which <pb
                            id="VAA2373-311" n="302"/> is inside them, and lie through rain and
                        freezing cold for months. A year from egg laying they come out like this,
                        and begin the process all over again. They don&apos;t eat, they
                        don&apos;t see distinctly, they live but a few days, and fly only at
                        night; then they drop off easy, but the process goes on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A shivering movement went over the moth. The wings drooped and spread wider.
                        Mrs. Comstock fell into soft awed tones.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There never was a moment in my life,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;when I felt so in the Presence, as I do now. I feel as if the
                        Almighty was so real, and so near, that I could reach out and touch Him, as
                        I could this wonderful work of His, if I dared. I feel like saying to Him,
                        &quot;To the extent of my brain power I realize Your presence, and all
                        it is in me to comprehend of Your power. Help me to learn, even this late,
                        the lessons of Your wonderful creations. Help me to unshackle and expand my
                        soul to the fullest realization of Your wonders. Almighty God, make me
                        bigger, make me broader!&quot;&apos;</p>
                    <p>The moth climbed to the end of the projection, up it a little way, then
                        suddenly reversed its wings, turning the hidden sides out and dropping them
                        along its abdomen, like a great fly. The outside of the wings, thus exposed,
                        was far richer colour, more exquisite texture than the under, and they
                        slowly half lifted and drooped again. Mrs. Comstock turned her face to
                        Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I an old fool, or do you feel it, too?&quot; she half
                        whispered.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-312" n="303"/>
                    <p>&quot;You are wiser than you ever have been before,&quot; answered
                        Ammon. &quot;I feel it, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I also,&quot; breathed Elnora.</p>
                    <p>The moth spread its wings, shivered them tremulously, opening and closing
                        them rapidly. Ammon handed the box to Elnora.</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t take that one,&quot; she said. &quot;Let
                        her go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, Elnora,&quot; protested Mrs. Comstock, &quot;I
                        don&apos;t want to let her go. She&apos;s mine. She&apos;s the
                        first one I ever found this way. Can&apos;t you put her in a big box,
                        and let her live without hurting her? I can&apos;t bear to let her go. I
                        want to learn all about her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then watch while we get these on the trees,&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;We will take her home until night and then decide what to do. She
                        won&apos;t fly for a long time yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock settled on the ground, an elbow on her knee, her chin in her
                        palm, gazing at the moth. Elnora and Ammon went to the baited trees, placing
                        several large moths and a number of smaller ones in the cyanide jar, and
                        searching the bushes beyond where they found several paired specimens of
                        differing families. When they returned Elnora showed her mother how to hold
                        her hand before the moth so that it would climb upon her fingers. Then they
                        started back to the cabin, Elnora and Ammon leading the way; Mrs. Comstock
                        followed slowly, stepping with great care lest she stumble and jar the moth.
                        Her face wore a look of <pb id="VAA2373-313" n="304"/> comprehension, in her
                        eyes was an exalted light. On she came to the blue-bordered pool lying
                        beside her path.</p>
                    <p>A turtle scrambled from a log and splashed into the water, while a red-wing
                        shouted, &quot;O-ka-lee!&quot; to her. Mrs. Comstock paused and
                        looked intently at the slimecovered quagmire, framed in a flower riot and
                        homed over by sweet-voiced birds. Then she gazed at the thing of
                        incomparable beauty clinging to her fingers and said softy: &quot;If you
                        had known about wonders like these in the days of your youth, Robert
                        Comstock, could you ever have done what you did?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora missed her mother, and turning to look for her, saw her standing
                        beside the pool. Would the old fascination return? A panic of fear seized
                        the girl. She went back swiftly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you afraid she is going?&quot; Elnora asked. &quot;If
                        you are, cup your other hand over her for shelter. Carrying her through this
                        air and in the hot sunshine will dry her wings and make them ready for
                        flight very quickly. You can&apos;t trust her in such air and light as
                        you can in the cool dark woods.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As she talked she took hold of her mother&apos;s sleeve, anxiously
                        smiling a pitiful little smile that Mrs. Comstock understood. Ammon set his
                        load at the back door, returning to hold open the garden gate for Elnora and
                        Mrs. Comstock. He reached it just in time to see them standing together
                        beside the pool. The mother bent swiftly and kissed the girl on the lips.
                        Ammon wheeled and was busily hunting moths on the raspberry <pb
                            id="VAA2373-314" n="[]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2373-2">
                            <p rend="center">&quot;&apos;If you had known about wonders like
                                these in the days of your youth. Robert Comstock, could you ever
                                have done the thing you did?&apos;&quot;</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2373-315" n="305"/> bushes when they reached the gate. And so
                        excellent are the rewards of attending your own business, that he found a
                        splendid Promethea on a lilac in a corner, a moth of such rare
                        wine-coloured, velvety shades that it almost sent Mrs. Comstock to her knees
                        again. But this one was fully developed, able to fly, and had to be taken
                        into the cabin hurriedly. Mrs. Comstock stood in the middle of the room
                        holding up her Regalis.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now what must I do?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>Elnora glanced at Philip Ammon. Their eyes met and both of them smiled; he
                        with amusement at the tall, spare figure, with dark eyes and white crown,
                        asking the childish question so confidingly; and Elnora with exultant pride.
                        The girl was beginning to appreciate the greatness of her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would you like to sit and see her finish development?
                        I&apos;ll get dinner,&quot; proposed the girl.</p>
                    <p>After they had dined, Ammon and Elnora carried the dishes to the kitchen,
                        brought out boxes, sheets of cork, pins, ink, paper for slips and everything
                        necessary for mounting and classifying the moths they had taken. When the
                        housework was finished Mrs. Comstock brought her ruffle and sat near,
                        watching and listening. She remembered all they said that she understood,
                        and when uncertain she asked questions. Occasionally she laid down her work
                        to straighten some flower which needed attention or to go to the garden for
                        a bug for the grosbeak. In one of these absences Elnora said to Ammon,
                        &quot;These replace quite a number of the moths I lost for <pb
                            id="VAA2373-316" n="306"/> the man of India. With a week of such luck, I
                        could almost begin to talk college again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no reason why you should not have the week and the
                        luck,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I have taken moths until the middle of
                        August, though I suspect one is more apt to find late ones in the north
                        where it is colder than here. The next week is hay-time, but we can count on
                        a few double-brooders and strays, and by working the exchange method for all
                        it is worth, I think we can complete the collection again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You almost make me hope,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;but I
                        must not allow myself. I don&apos;t truly think I can replace all I
                        lost, not even with your help. If I could, I can&apos;t see my way clear
                        to leave mother this winter. I have found her so recently, and she is so
                        precious, I can&apos;t risk losing her again. I am going to take the
                        nature position in the Onabasha schools, and I shall be most happy doing the
                        work. Only, these are a temptation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you might go to college this fall with the other
                        girls,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I feel that if you don&apos;t you
                        never will. Isn&apos;t there some way?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t see it if there is, and I really don&apos;t
                        want to leave mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, mother is mighty glad to hear it,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Comstock, entering the arbour.</p>
                    <p>Ammon noticed that her face was pale, her lips quivering, her voice cold.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was just saying to your daughter that she should <pb
                            id="VAA2373-317" n="307"/> go to college this winter,&apos; he
                        explained, &quot;but she says she don&apos;t want to leave
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If she wants to go, I wish she could,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock,
                        a look of relief spreading over her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, all girls want to go to college,&quot; said Ammon.
                        &quot;It&apos;s the only proper place to learn bridge and
                        embroidery; not to mention midnight lunches of mixed pickles and fruit cake,
                        and all the delights of the sororities.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have thought a great deal about going to college,&quot; said
                        Elnora, &quot;but I never thought of any of those things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is because your education in fudge and bridge has been sadly
                        neglected,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;You should hear my sister Polly!
                        This was her last year! Lunches and sororities were all I heard her mention,
                        until Tom Levering came on deck; now he is the leading subject. I
                        can&apos;t see from her daily conversation, that she knows half as much
                        really worth knowing as you do, but she can beat you miles on fun.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, we had some good times in the high school,&quot; said
                        Elnora. &quot;Life hasn&apos;t been all work and study. Is Edith
                        Carr a college girl?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. She is the very selectest kind of a private boarding school
                        girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is she?&quot; asked Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>Ammon opened his lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is a girl in Chicago, that Mr. Ammon knows very well,&quot;
                        said Elnora. &quot;She is beautiful and rich, and a friend of his
                        sister&apos;s. Or, didn&apos;t you say that?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-318" n="308"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t remember, but she is&quot; said Ammon.
                        &quot;This moth needs an alcohol bath to take off the dope.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t the down come, too?&quot; asked Elnora
                        anxiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. You watch and you will see it come out, as Polly would say, a
                        perfectly good moth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is your sister younger than you?&quot; inquired Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Ammon, &quot;but she is three years older
                        than you. She is the dearest sister in all the world. I&apos;d love to
                        see her now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you send for her,&quot; suggested Elnora.
                        &quot;Perhaps she&apos;d like to help us catch moths.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I think Polly in a Virot hat, Picot embroidered frock and
                        three-inch heels would take more moths than anyone that ever struck the
                        Limberlost,&quot; laughed Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you get lots of them, and you are her brother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but that is different. Father was raised in Onabasha, and he
                        loved the country. He trained me his way and mother took charge of Polly. I
                        don&apos;t just understand it. Mother is a great home body herself, but
                        she did succeed in making Polly strictly ornamental.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does Tom Levering need a &quot;strictly ornamental&apos;
                        girl?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are too matter of fact! Too &quot;strictly&apos;
                        material! He needs a darling girl who will love him plenty, and Polly is
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, does the Limberlost need a &quot;strictly
                        ornamental&apos; girl?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-319" n="309"/>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot; cried Ammon. &quot;You are ornament enough for
                        the Limberlost. I have changed my mind. I don&apos;t want Polly here.
                        She would not enjoy catching moths, or anything we do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She might,&quot; persisted Elnora. &quot;You are her
                        brother, and surely you care for these things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The argument does not hold,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;Polly
                        and I do not like the same things when we are at home, but we are very fond
                        of each other. The member of my family who would go crazy about this is my
                        father. I wish he could come, if only for a week. I&apos;d send for him,
                        but he is tied up in preparing some papers for a great corporation case this
                        summer. He likes the country. It was his vote that brought me
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon leaned back in the arbour, watching the grosbeak as it hunted food
                        between a tomato vine and a day lily. Elnora set him to making labels, and
                        when he finished them he asked permission to write a letter. He took no
                        pains to conceal his page, and from where she sat opposite him, Elnora could
                        not look his way without reading, &quot;My dearest Edith.&quot; He
                        wrote busily for a time and then sat staring out across the garden.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you run out of material so quickly?&quot; asked Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s about it,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I have
                        said that I am getting well as rapidly as possible, that the air is fine,
                        the folks at Uncle Doc&apos;s all well, and entirely too good to me;
                        that I am spending most of my time in the country helping catch moths for a
                        collection, which is <pb id="VAA2373-320" n="310"/> splendid exercise; now I
                        can&apos;t think of another thing that will be interesting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a burst of exquisite notes in the maple.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Put in the grosbeak,&quot; suggested Elnora. &quot;Tell her
                        you are so friendly with him you feed him potato bugs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon dropped the pen to the sheet, bent forward, then hesitated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Blest if I do!&quot; he cried. &quot;She&apos;d think a
                        grosbeak was a depraved person with a large nose. She&apos;d never dream
                        that it was a black-robed lover, with a breast of snow and a crimson heart.
                        She don&apos;t care for hungry babies and potato bugs. I shall write
                        that to father. He will find it exquisite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora deftly picked up a moth, pinned it and placed its wings. She
                        straightened the antenn, drew each leg into position and set it in perfectly
                        lifelike manner. As she lifted her work to see if she had it right, she
                        glanced at Ammon. He was still frowning and hesitating over the paper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I dare you to let me dictate a couple of paragraphs,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Done!&quot; cried Ammon. &quot;Go slowly enough that I can
                        write it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora laughed softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am writing this,&quot; she began, &quot;in an old grape
                        arbour in the country, near a log cabin where I had my dinner. From where I
                        sit I can see directly into the home of the next-door neighbour on the west.
                        His name is R. B. Grosbeak. From all I have seen of him, <pb
                            id="VAA2373-321" n="311"/> he is a gentleman of the old school; the
                        oldest school there is, no doubt. He always wears a black suit and cap and a
                        white vest, decorated with one large red heart, which I think must be the
                        emblem of some ancient order. I have been here a number of times, and I
                        never have seen him wear anything else, or his wife appear in other than a
                        brown dress with touches of white.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It has appeared to me at times that she was a shade neglectful of
                        her home duties, but he does not seem to see it that way. He cheerfully
                        stays about the sitting room, while she is away having a good time, and
                        sings as he cares for the four small children. I must tell you about his
                        music. I am sure he never saw inside a conservatory. I think he merely
                        picked up what he knows by ear and without vocal training, but there is a
                        tenderness in his tones, a depth of pure melody, that I never have heard
                        surpassed. It may be that I think more of his music than that of some other
                        good vocalists hereabout, because I see more of him and appreciate his
                        devotion to his home life.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I just had an encounter with him at the west fence, and induced him
                        to carry a small gift to his children. When I see the perfect harmony in
                        which he lives, and the depth of content he and the brown lady find in life,
                        I am almost persuaded tonow this is going to be poetry,&quot; said
                        Elnora. &quot;Move your pen over here and begin with a quote and a
                        cap.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon&apos;s face had been an interesting study as he <pb
                            id="VAA2373-322" n="312"/> took down her sentences. Now he gravely set
                        the pen where she indicated, and Elnora dictated</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Buy a nice little home in the country,</l>
                        <l n="2">And settle down there for life.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the truth!&quot; cried Ammon.
                        &quot;It&apos;s as big a temptation as I ever had. Go on!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;You can
                        finish. The moths are done. I am going hunting for whatever I can find for
                        the grades.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; begged Ammon. &quot;I am going,
                        too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. You stay with mother and finish your letter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is done. I couldn&apos;t add anything to that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right! Sign your name and come on. But I forgot to tell you all
                        the bargain. Maybe you won&apos;t send the letter when you hear that.
                        The rest is that you show me the reply to my part of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s easy! I wouldn&apos;t have the slightest
                        objection to showing you the whole letter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He signed his name, folded the sheets and slipped them into his pocket.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are we going and what do we take?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you go, mother?&quot; asked Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have a little work that should be done,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;Could you spare me? Where do you want to go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will go down to Aunt Margaret&apos;s and see her a few
                        minutes and get Billy. We will be back in time for supper.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-323" n="313"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock smiled as she watched them down the road. What a splendid
                        looking pair of young creatures they were! How finely proportioned, how full
                        of vitality! Then her face grew troubled as she saw them in earnest
                        conversation. Just as she was wishing she had not trusted her precious girl
                        with so much of a stranger, she saw Elnora stoop to lift a branch and peer
                        under. The mother grew content. Elnora was thinking only of her work. She
                        was to be trusted utterly.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p>A FEW days later Ammon handed Elnora a sheet of paper and she read:
                        &quot;In your condition I should think the moth hunting and life at that
                        cabin would be very good for you, but for any sake keep away from that
                        Grosbeak person, and don&apos;t come home with your head full of granger
                        ideas. No doubt he has a remarkable voice, but I can&apos;t bear
                        untrained singers, and don&apos;t you get the idea that a June song is
                        perennial. You are not hearing the music he will make when the four babies
                        get the scarlet fever and the measles, and the gadding wife leaves him at
                        home to care for them then. Poor soul, I pity her! How she exists where
                        rampant cows bellow at you, frogs croak, mosquitoes consume you, the butter
                        goes to oil in summer and bricks in winter, while the pump freezes every
                        day, and there is no earthly amusement, and no society! Poor things!
                        Can&apos;t you influence him to move? No wonder she gads when she has a
                        chance! I should die. If you are thinking of settling in the country, think
                        also of a woman who is satisfied with white and brown to accompany you!
                        Brown! Of all deadly colours! I should go mad in brown.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-325" n="315"/>
                    <p>Elnora laughed as she read. Her face was dimpling as she handed back the
                        sheet. &quot;Who&apos;s ahead?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who do you think?&quot; he parried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Are you going to tell her
                        in your next that R. B. Grosbeak is a bird, and that he probably will spend
                        the winter in a wild plum thicket in Tennessee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I shall tell her that I
                        understand her ideas of life perfectly, and, of course, I never shall ask
                        her to deal with oily butter and frozen pumps&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;and measley babies,&quot; interpolated Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Exactly!&quot; said Ammon. &quot;Just the same I find so
                        much to counterbalance those things, that I should not object to bearing
                        them myself, in view of the recompense. Where do we go and what do we do
                        to-day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will have to wander along the roads and around the edge of the
                        Limberlost to-day,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Mother is making
                        strawberry preserves, and she can&apos;t come until she finishes.
                        Suppose we go down to the swamp and I&apos;ll show you what is left of
                        the flower-room that Terrence O&apos;More, the big lumber man of Great
                        Rapids, made when he was a homeless boy here. Of course, you have heard the
                        story?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and I&apos;ve met the O&apos;Mores who are frequently
                        in Chicago society. They have friends there. I think them one ideal
                        couple.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That sounds like they might be the only one, or close to
                        it,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;and, indeed, they are not.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-326" n="316"/>
                    <p>I know dozens. Aunt Margaret and Uncle Wesley are another, the Brownlees
                        another, and my mathematics professor and his wife. The world is full of
                        happy people, but no one ever hears of them. You have to fight and make a
                        scandal to get into the papers. No one knows about all the happy people. I
                        am happy myself, and just look how perfectly inconspicuous I am.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You only need go where you will be seen,&quot; began Ammon,
                        when he remembered and finished. &quot;What do we take to-day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ourselves,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I have a vagabond
                        streak in my blood and it&apos;s in evidence. I am going to show you
                        where real flowers grow, real birds sing, and if I feel quite right about
                        it, perhaps I shall raise a note or two myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, do you sing?&quot; asked Ammon politely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At times,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;&apos;As do the
                        birds, because I must,&apos; but don&apos;t be scared. The mood does
                        not possess me often. Perhaps I shan&apos;t raise a note when we get
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They went down the road to the swamp, climbed the snake fence, followed the
                        path to the old trail and then turned south along it. Elnora indicated to
                        Ammon the trail with remnants of sagging barbed wire.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was ten years ago,&quot; she said. &quot;I was just a
                        little school girl, but I wandered widely even then, and no one cared. I saw
                        him often. He had been in a city institution all his life, when he took the
                        job of keeping timber thieves out of this swamp, before many trees <pb
                            id="VAA2373-327" n="317"/> had been cut. It was strong man&apos;s
                        work, and he was a frail boy, but he grew hardier as he lived out of doors.
                        This trail we are on is the path his feet first wore, in those days when he
                        was insane with fear and eaten up with loneliness, but he stuck to his work
                        and won out. I used to come down to the road and creep in among the bushes
                        as far as I dared, to watch him pass. He walked mostly, sometimes he rode a
                        wheel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Some days his face was dreadfully sad, some days it was so
                        determined a little child could see the force in it, and once it was
                        radiant. That day the Swamp Angel was with him. I can&apos;t tell you
                        what she was like. I never saw any one who resembled her. He stopped near
                        here to show her a bird&apos;s nest. Then they went on to a sort of
                        flower-room he had made, and he sang for her. By the time he left, I had
                        gotten bold enough to come out on the trail, and I met the big Scotchman
                        Freckles lived with. He saw me catching moths and butterflies, so he took me
                        to the flower-room and gave me everything there. I don&apos;t dare come
                        alone often, and so I can&apos;t keep it up as he did, but you can see
                        something of how it was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora led the way and Ammon followed. The outlines of the room were not
                        distinct, because many of the trees were gone, but Elnora showed how it had
                        been as nearly as she could.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The swamp is almost ruined now,&quot; she said. &quot;The
                        maples, walnuts, and cherries are all gone. The talking trees are the only
                        things left worth while.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-328" n="318"/>
                    <p>&quot;The &apos;talking trees&apos;! I don&apos;t
                        understand,&quot; commented Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No wonder!&quot; laughed Elnora. &quot;They are my
                        discovery. You know all trees whisper and talk during the summer, but there
                        are two that have so much to say they keep on the whole winter, when the
                        others are silent. The beeches and oaks so love to talk, they cling to their
                        dead, dry leaves. In the winter the winds are stiffest and blow most, so
                        these trees whisper, chatter, sob, laugh, and at times roar until the sound
                        is deafening. They never cease until new leaves come out in the spring to
                        push off the old ones. I love to stand beneath them with my ear to the great
                        trunks, interpreting what they say to fit my moods. The beeches branch low,
                        and their leaves are small so they only know common earthly things; but the
                        oaks run straight above almost all other trees before they branch, their
                        arms are mighty, their leaves large. They meet the winds that travel around
                        the globe, and from them learn the big things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon studied the girl face. &quot;What do the beeches tell you,
                        Elnora?&quot; he asked gently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To be patient, to be unselfish, to do unto others as I would have
                        them do to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the oaks?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They say &apos;be true,&apos; &apos;live a clean
                        life,&apos; &apos;send your soul up here and let the winds of the
                        world teach it what honour achieves.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wonderful secrets, those!&quot; marvelled Ammon. &quot;Are
                        they telling them now? Could I hear?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-329" n="319"/>
                    <p>&quot;No. They are only gossipping now. This is playtime. They tell the
                        big secrets to a white world, when the music inspires them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The music?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All other trees are harps in the winter. Their trunks are the
                        frames, their branches the strings, the winds the musicians. When the air is
                        cold and clear, the world very white, and the harp music swelling, then the
                        talking trees tell the strengthening, uplifting things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wonderful girl!&quot; cried Ammon. &quot;What a woman
                        you will be!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I am a woman at all worth while, it will be because I have had
                        such wonderful opportunities,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Not every
                        girl is driven to the forest to learn what God has to say there. Here are
                        the remains of Freckles&apos;s room. The time the Angel came here he
                        sang to her, and I listened. I never heard music like that. No wonder she
                        loved him. Everyone who knew him did, and they do yet. Try that log, it
                        makes a fairly good seat. This old store box was his treasure house, just as
                        it&apos;s now mine. I will show you my dearest possession. I do not dare
                        take it home because mother can&apos;t overcome her dislike for it. It
                        was my father&apos;s, and in some ways I am like him. This is the
                        strongest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora lifted the violin and began to play. She wore a school dress of green
                        gingham, with the sleeves rolled to the elbows. She seemed a part of the
                        setting all around her. Her head shone like a small dark sun, and her face
                        never had seemed so rose-flushed and fair.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-330" n="320"/>
                    <p>From the instant she drew the bow, her lips parted and her eyes fastened on
                        something far away in the swamp, and never did she give more of that
                        impression of feeling for her notes and repeating something audible only to
                        her. Ammon was too near to get the best effect. He arose and stepped back
                        several yards, leaning against a large tree. looking and listening with all
                        his soul.</p>
                    <p>As he changed positions he saw that Mrs. Comstock had followed them, and was
                        standing on the trail, where she could not have helped hearing everything
                        Elnora had said. So to Ammon before her and the mother watching on the
                        trail, Elnora played the Song of the Limberlost. It seemed as if the swamp
                        hushed all its other voices and spoke only through her dancing bow. The
                        mother out on the trail had heard it all, once before from the girl, many
                        times from her father. To the man it was a revelation. He stood so stunned
                        he forgot Mrs. Comstock. He tried to realize what a great city audience
                        would say to that music, from such a player, with a like background, and he
                        could not imagine.</p>
                    <p>He was wondering what he dared say, how much he might express, when the last
                        note fell and the girl laid the violin in the case, closed the door, locked
                        it and hid the key in the rotting wood at the end of a log. Then she came to
                        him. Ammon stood looking at her curiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder,&quot; he said, &quot;what people would say to
                        that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did it in public once,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I think
                        they liked it, fairly well. I had a note yesterday offering <pb
                            id="VAA2373-331" n="321"/> me the leadership of the high school
                        orchestra in Onabasha. I can take it as well as not. None of my talks to the
                        grades come the first thing in the morning. I can play a few minutes in the
                        orchestra and reach the rooms in plenty of time. It will be more work that I
                        love, and like finding the money. I would gladly play for nothing, just to
                        be able to express myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;With some people it makes a regular battlefield of the human
                        heartthis struggle for self-expression,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;You
                        are going to do beautiful work in the world, and do it well. When I realize
                        that your violin belonged to your father, that he played it before you were
                        born, and it no doubt affected your mother strongly, and then couple with
                        that the years you have roamed these fields and swamps finding in nature all
                        you had to lavish your great heart upon, I can see how you evolved. I
                        understand what you mean by self-expression. I know something of what you
                        have to express. The world never so wanted your message as it does now. It
                        is hungry for the things you know. I can see easily how your position came
                        to you. What you have to give is taught in no college, and I am not sure but
                        you would spoil yourself if you tried to run your mind through a set groove
                        with hundreds of others. I never thought I should say such a thing to
                        anyone, but I do say to you, and I honestly believe it; give up the college
                        idea. Your mind does not need that sort of development, it is far past it.
                        Stick close to your work in the woods. You are getting so infinitely greater
                        on it, <pb id="VAA2373-332" n="322"/> than the best college student I ever
                        knew, that there is no comparison. When you have money to spend, take that
                        violin and go to one of the world&apos;s great masters and let the
                        Limberlost sing to him; if he thinks he can improve it, very well. I have my
                        doubts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you really mean that you would give up all idea of going to
                        college, if you were me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I really mean it,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;If I now held the
                        money to send you in my hands, and could give it to you in some way you
                        would accept I would tear it up and throw it away first. I do not know why
                        it is the lot of the world always to want something different from what life
                        gives them. If you only could realize it, my girl, you are in college, and
                        have been always. You are in the school of experience, and it has taught you
                        to think, and given you a heart. God knows I envy the man who wins it! You
                        have been in the college of the Limberlost all your life, and I never met a
                        graduate from any other institution who could begin to compare with you in
                        sanity, clarity, and interesting knowledge. I wouldn&apos;t even advise
                        you to read too many books on your lines. You get your stuff first hand, and
                        you know that you are right. What you should do is to begin early to
                        practise self-expression. Don&apos;t wait too long to tell us about the
                        woods as you know them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Follow the course of the Bird Woman, you mean?&quot; asked
                        Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In your own way; with your own light. She won&apos;t live
                        forever. You are younger, and you will be ready <pb id="VAA2373-333" n="323"
                        /> to begin where she ends. The swamp has given you all you need so far, now
                        you give it to the world in payment. College be confounded! Go to work and
                        show people what there is in you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Not until then did he remember that Mrs. Comstock was somewhere very near.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Should we go out to the trail and see if your mother is
                        coming?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here she is now,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Gracious,
                        it&apos;s a mercy I got that violin put away in time! I didn&apos;t
                        expect her so soon,&quot; whispered the girl as she turned and went
                        toward her mother. Mrs. Comstock&apos;s face was a study as she looked
                        at Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I forgot that you were making sun-preserves and they
                        didn&apos;t require much cooking,&quot; she said. &quot;We
                        should have waited for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at all!&quot; answered Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Have you
                        found anything yet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing that I can show you,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;I am
                        not sure but I have found an idea that will revolutionize the whole course
                        of my work, thought, and ambitions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Ambitions!&apos; My, what a hefty word!&quot;
                        laughed Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Now, who would suspect a little red-haired
                        country girl of harbouring such a deadly germ in her body? Can you tell
                        mother about it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not if you talk to me that way, I can&apos;t,&quot; said
                        Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I guess we better let ambition lie. I&apos;ve always
                        heard it was safest asleep. If you ever get a <pb id="VAA2373-334" n="324"/>
                        bona fide attack, it will be time to attend it. Let&apos;s hunt
                        specimens. It is June. Philip and I are in the grades. You have an hour to
                        put an idea into our heads that will stick for a lifetime, and grow for
                        good. That&apos;s the way I look at your job. Now, what are you going to
                        give us? We don&apos;t want any old silly stuff that has been hashed
                        over and over, we want a big new idea to plant in our hearts. Come on, Miss
                        Teacher, what is the boiled-down, double-distilled essence of June? Give it
                        to us strong. We are large enough to furnish it developing ground. Hurry up!
                        Time is short and we are waiting. What is the miracle of June? What one
                        thing epitomizes the whole month, and makes it just a little different from
                        any other?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The birth of these big night moths,&quot; said Elnora promptly.</p>
                    <p>Ammon clapped his hands. The tears started to Mrs. Comstock&apos;s eyes.
                        She took Elnora in her arms, and kissed her forehead.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll do!&quot; she said. &quot;June is June, not
                        because it has bloom, bird, fruit, or flower, exclusive to it alone.
                        It&apos;s half May and half July in all of them. But as I figure it,
                        it&apos;s just June, when it comes to these great, velvet-winged night
                        moths which sweep its moonlit skies, consummating their scheme of creation,
                        and dropping like a bloomed-out flower. Give them moths for June. Then make
                        that the basis of your year&apos;s work. Find the distinctive feature of
                        each month, the one thing which marks it a time apart, and hit them squarely
                            <pb id="VAA2373-335" n="325"/> between the eyes with it. Even the babies
                        of the lowest grades can comprehend moths when they see a few emerge, and
                        learn their history, as it can be lived before them. You should show your
                        specimens in pairs, then their eggs, the growing caterpillars, and then the
                        cocoons. You want to dig out the red heart of every month in the year, and
                        hold it pulsing before them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t name all of them off-hand, but I think of one more
                        right now. February belongs to our winter birds. It is then the great horned
                        owl of the swamp courts his mate, the big hawks pair, and even the crows
                        begin to take notice. These are truly our birds. Like the poor we have them
                        always with us. You should hear the musicians of this swamp in February,
                        Philip, on a mellow night. Oh, but they are in earnest! For twenty-one years
                        I&apos;ve listened by night to the great owls, all the smaller sizes,
                        the foxes, coons, and every resident left in these woods, and by day to the
                        hawks, yellow-hammers, sap-suckers, titmice, crows, and all our winter
                        birds. Only just now it&apos;s come to me that the distinctive feature
                        of February is not linen bleaching, nor sugar making; it&apos;s the love
                        month of our very own birds. Give them hawks and owls for February,
                        Elnora.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The girl looked at Ammon with flashing eyes. &quot;How&apos;s
                        that?&quot; she said. &quot;Don&apos;t you think I will make it,
                        with such help? You should hear the concert she is talking about! It is
                        simply indescribable when the ground is covered with snow, and the moonlight
                        white.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-336" n="326"/>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s about the best music we have,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;I just wonder if you couldn&apos;t copy that alone
                        and make a strong, original piece out of it for your violin,
                        Elnora?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was one tense breath, then&quot;I could try,&quot; said Elnora
                        simply.</p>
                    <p>Ammon rushed to the rescue. &quot;We must go to work,&quot; he said,
                        and began examining a walnut branch for Luna moth eggs. Elnora joined him
                        while Mrs. Comstock drew her embroidery from her pocket and sat on a log.
                        She said she was tired, they could come for her when they were ready to go.
                        She could hear their voices all around her until she called them at supper
                        time. When they came to her she stood waiting on the trail, the sewing in
                        one hand, the violin in the other. Elnora became very white, but took the
                        trail without a word. Ammon, unable to see a woman carry a heavier load than
                        he, reached for the instrument. Mrs. Comstock shook her head. She carried
                        the violin home, took it into her room and closed the door. Elnora turned to
                        Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If she destroys that, I will die!&quot; cried the girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She won&apos;t!&quot; said Ammon. &quot;You
                        misunderstand her. She wouldn&apos;t have said what she did about the
                        owls, if she had meant to. She is your mother. No one loves you as she does.
                        Trust her! MyselfI think she&apos;s simply great!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock returned with serene face, and all of them helped with the
                        supper. When it was over Ammon <pb id="VAA2373-337" n="327"/> and Elnora
                        sorted and classified the afternoon&apos;s specimens, and made a trip to
                        the woods to paint and light several trees for moths. When they came back
                        Mrs. Comstock sat in the arbour, and they joined her. The moonlight was so
                        intense, print could have been read by it. The damp night air held odours
                        near to earth, making flower and tree perfume strong. A thousand insects
                        were serenading, and in the maple the grosbeak occasionally said a
                        reassuring word to his wife, while she answered that all was well. A
                        whip-poor-will wailed in the swamp and back by the blue-bordered pool a chat
                        complained disconsolately. Mrs. Comstock went into the cabin, but she
                        returned almost instantly, laying the violin and bow across
                        Elnora&apos;s lap. &quot;I wish you would give us a little
                        music,&quot; she said.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p>B<hi rend="sc">ILLY</hi> was swinging in the hammock, at peace with himself
                        and all the world, when he thought he heard something. He sat bolt upright,
                        his eyes staring. Once he opened his lips, then thought again and closed
                        them. The sound persisted. Billy vaulted the fence, and ran down the road
                        with his queer sidewise hop. When he neared the Comstock cabin, he left the
                        warm dust of the highway and stepped softly at slower pace over the rank
                        grasses by the roadside. He had heard aright. The violin was in the grape
                        arbour, singing like mad, singing a perfect jumble of everything, poured out
                        in an exultant tumult. The strings were voicing the joy of a happy girl
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>Billy climbed the fence enclosing the west woods and crept down toward the
                        arbour. He was not a spy and not a sneak. He merely wanted to satisfy his
                        child-heart as to whether Mrs. Comstock was at home, and Elnora at last
                        playing her loved violin with her mother&apos;s consent. One peep
                        sufficed. Mrs. Comstock sat in the moonlight, her head leaning against the
                        arbour; on her face was a look of perfect peace and contentment.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-339" n="329"/>
                    <p>As he stared at her the bow hesitated a second and Mrs. Comstock spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all very melodious and sweet,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;but I do wish you could play Money Musk and some of the tunes I
                        danced as a girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora had been avoiding carefully every note that might be reminiscent of
                        her father. At the words she laughed softly and struck into &quot;Turkey
                        in the Straw.&quot; An instant later Mrs. Comstock was dancing like mad
                        in the moonlight. Ammon sprang to her side, caught her in his arms, while to
                        Elnora&apos;s laughter and the violin&apos;s impetus they danced
                        until they dropped panting on the arbour bench.</p>
                    <p>Billy scarcely knew when he got back on the road. His light feet barely
                        touched the soft way, so swiftly he flew. He vaulted the fence and burst
                        into the house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aunt Margaret! Uncle Wesley!&quot; he screamed.
                        &quot;Listen! Listen! She&apos;s playing it! Elnora&apos;s
                        playing her violin at home! And Aunt Kate is dancing like anything before
                        the arbour! I saw her in the moonlight! I ran down! Oh, Aunt
                        Margaret!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy fled to his haven and sobbed on Margaret&apos;s breast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Billy!&quot; she chided. &quot;Don&apos;t cry, you
                        little dunce! That&apos;s what we&apos;ve all prayed for these many
                        years; but you must be mistaken about Kate. I can&apos;t believe
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy lifted his head. &quot;Well, you just have to!&quot; he said.
                        &quot;When I say I saw anything, Uncle Wesley knows <pb id="VAA2373-340"
                            n="330"/> I did. The city man was dancing with her. They danced together
                        and Elnora laughed. But it didn&apos;t look funny to me; I was
                        scared.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who was it said &apos;wonders would never
                        cease&apos;?&quot; asked Wesley. &quot;You mark my word, once
                        you get Kate Comstock started, you can&apos;t stop her. There&apos;s
                        a wagon load of penned-up force in her. Dancing in the moonlight! Well,
                        I&apos;ll be hanged!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy was at his side instantly. &quot;Well, whoever does it will have to
                        hang me, too,&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>Sinton threw his arm around Billy and drew him close. &quot;Tell us all
                        about it, son,&quot; he said. Billy told. &quot;And when Elnora just
                        stopped a breath, &apos;Can&apos;t you play some of the old things I
                        knew when I was a girl?&apos; said her ma. Then Elnora began to do a
                        thing that made you want to whirl round and round, and quicker &apos;an
                        scat there was her ma a-whirling. The city man, he ups and grabs her and
                        whirls, too, and back in the woods I was going just like they did. Elnora
                        begins to laugh, and I ran to tell you, &apos;cos I knew you&apos;d
                        like to know. Now, all the world is right, ain&apos;t it?&quot;
                        ended Billy as he leaned against Sinton in supreme satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You just bet it is!&quot; said Wesley.</p>
                    <p>Billy looked steadily at Margaret. &quot;Is it, Aunt Margaret?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret Sinton smiled at him bravely.</p>
                    <p>An hour later when Billy was ready to climb the stairs to his room, he went
                        to Margaret to say good night. He leaned against her an instant, and brought
                            <pb id="VAA2373-341" n="331"/> his lips close her ear. &quot;Wish I
                        could get your little girls back for you!&quot; he whispered and dashed
                        for the stairs.</p>
                    <p>Down at the Comstock cabin the violin played on until Elnora was so tired she
                        scarcely could lift the bow. Then Ammon went home. The women walked to the
                        gate with him, and stood watching him from sight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s what I call one decent young man!&quot; said
                        Mrs. Comstock. &quot;To see him fit in with us, you&apos;d think
                        he&apos;d been raised in a cabin; but it&apos;s likely he&apos;s
                        always had the very cream o&apos; the pot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; laughed Elnora, &quot;but it
                        hasn&apos;t hurt him. I&apos;ve never seen anything I could
                        criticize. He&apos;s teaching me so much, unconsciously. You know he
                        graduated from Harvard, and has several degrees in law. He&apos;s coming
                        in the morning, and we are going to put in a big day on Catocal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Which is?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Those gray moths with wings that fold back like big flies, and they
                        appear as if they had been carved from old wood. Then, when they fly, the
                        lower wings flash out and they are red and black, or gold and black, or pink
                        and black, or dozens of bright, beautiful colours combined with black. No
                        one ever has classified all of them and written their complete history,
                        unless the Bird Woman is doing it now. She wants everything she can get
                        about them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;They are mighty
                        pretty things. I&apos;ve started up slews of them <pb id="VAA2373-342"
                            n="332"/> from the vines covering the logs, all my life. I must be
                        cautious and catch them after this, but they seem powerful spry. I might get
                        hold of something rare.&quot; She thought intently and added,
                        &quot;And wouldn&apos;t know it if I did. It would just be my luck.
                        I&apos;ve had the rarest thing on earth in reach this many a day and
                        only had the wit to cinch it just as it was going. I&apos;ll bet I
                        don&apos;t let anything else escape me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Next morning Ammon came early, and he and Elnora went at once to the fields
                        and woods. Mrs. Comstock had come to believe so implicitly in him that she
                        now stayed at home to complete the work before she joined them, and when she
                        did she often sat sewing, leaving them wandering hours at a time. It was
                        noon before she finished, and then she packed a basket of lunch. She found
                        Elnora and Philip near the violet patch, which was still in its prime. They
                        all lunched together in the shade of a wild crab thicket, with flowers
                        spread at their feet, and the gold orioles streaking the air with flashes of
                        light and trailing ecstasy behind them, while the red-wings, as always,
                        asked the most impertinent questions. Then Mrs. Comstock carried the basket
                        back to the cabin, and Ammon and Elnora sat on a log, resting a few minutes.
                        They had unexpected luck, and both were eager to continue the search.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you remember your promise about these violets?&quot; asked
                        Ammon. &quot;To-morrow is Edith&apos;s birthday, and if I&apos;d
                        put them special delivery on the morning train, she&apos;d get them in
                        the late afternoon. They ought <pb id="VAA2373-343" n="333"/> to keep well
                        that long. She leaves for the North next day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, you can have them,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;We
                        will quit long enough before supper to gather a great bunch. They can be
                        packed so they will carry all right. They should be perfectly fresh,
                        especially if we gather them this evening and let them drink all
                        night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then they went back to hunt Catocal. It was a long and a happy search. It led
                        them into new, unexplored nooks of the woods, by a red-poll nest, and where
                        goldfinches prospected for thistledown for the cradles they would line a
                        little later. It led them into real forest, where deep, dark pools lay,
                        where the hermit thrush and the wood robin extracted the essence from all
                        other bird melody, and poured it out in their pure bell-tone notes. It
                        seemed as if every old gray tree-trunk, slab of loose bark, and prostrate
                        log yielded the flashing gray treasures; while of all others they seemed to
                        take alarm most easily, and be most difficult to capture.</p>
                    <p>Ammon came to Elnora at dusk, daintily holding one by the body, its dark
                        wings showing and its long slender legs trying to clasp his fingers and
                        creep from his hold.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, for mercy&apos;s sake!&quot; cried Elnora, and stared
                        at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I half believe it!&quot; exulted Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you ever see one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only in collections, and mighty seldom there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora studied the black wings intently. &quot;I surely believe
                        that&apos;s Sappho,&quot; she marvelled. &quot;The Bird Woman
                        will be overjoyed.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-344" n="334"/>
                    <p>&quot;We must get the cyanide jar quickly,&quot; said Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t lose her for a hundred dollars. Such a chase as
                        she led me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora got the jar and began gathering up paraphernalia.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When you make a find like that,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;it&apos;s the right time to quit and feel glorious all the
                        rest of that day. I tell you I&apos;m proud! We will go now. We have
                        barely time to carry out our plans before supper. Won&apos;t mother be
                        pleased to see that we have a rare one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like to see anyone more pleased than I am!&quot;
                        said Philip Ammon. &quot;I feel as if I&apos;d earned my supper
                        to-night. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took the greater part of the load and stepped aside for Elnora to precede
                        him. She went down the path, broken by the grazing cattle, toward the cabin
                        and nearest the violet patch she stopped, laid down her net, and the things
                        she carried. Ammon passed her and hurried straight toward the back gate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you going to?&quot; began Elnora.</p>
                    <p>I&apos;m going to get this moth home in a hurry,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;This cyanide has lost its strength, and it&apos;s not working
                        well. We need some fresh in the jar.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had forgotten the violets! Elnora stood looking after him, a curious
                        expression on her face. One second sothen she picked up the net and
                        followed. At the blue-bordered pool she paused and half turned back, then
                        she closed her lips firmly and went on. It was nine o&apos;clock when
                        Ammon said good-bye, and started <pb id="VAA2373-345" n="335"/> to town. His
                        gay whistle floated to them from the farthest corner of the Limberlost.
                        Elnora complained of being tired, so she went to her room and to bed. But
                        sleep would not come. Thought was racing in her brain and the longer she lay
                        the wider awake she grew. At last she softly slipped from bed, lighted her
                        lamp and began opening boxes. Then she went to work. Two hours later a
                        beautiful birch bark basket, strongly and artistically made stood on her
                        table. She set a tiny alarm clock at three, returned to bed and fell asleep
                        instantly with a smile on her lips.</p>
                    <p>She was on the floor with the first tinkle of the alarm, and hastily
                        dressing, she picked up the basket and a box to fit it, crept down the
                        stairs, and out to the violet patch. She was unafraid as it was so near
                        morning, and lining the basket with damp mosses she swiftly began picking
                        with practised hands, the youngest of the flowers. It was so dark she
                        scarcely could tell which were freshest at times, but day soon came creeping
                        over the Limberlost and peeped down at her. The robins awoke all their
                        neighbours, and a babel of bird notes filled the air. The dew was dripping,
                        and the first strong rays of light fell on a world in which Elnora
                        worshipped. When the basket was filled to overflowing, she set it in the
                        stout pasteboard box, packed it solid with mosses, tied it firmly and
                        slipped under the cord a note she had written the previous night.</p>
                    <p>Then she took a short cut across the woods and walked swiftly to Onabasha. It
                        was after six o&apos;clock, but all</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-346" n="336"/>
                    <p>of the city she wished to avoid were asleep. She had no trouble in finding a
                        small boy out, and she stood at a distance waiting while he rang Dr.
                        Ammon&apos;s bell and delivered the package for Philip to a maid, with
                        the note which was to be given him at once.</p>
                    <p>On the way home through the woods passing some baited trees she collected the
                        captive moths. She entered the kitchen with them so naturally that Mrs.
                        Comstock made no comment. After breakfast Elnora went to her room, cleared
                        away all trace of the night&apos;s work and was out in the arbour
                        mounting moths when Ammon came down the road. &quot;I am tired
                        sitting,&quot; she said to her mother. &quot;I think I will walk a
                        few rods and meet him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s a trump?&quot; called Ammon from afar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, not you!&quot; retorted Elnora. &quot;Confess that
                        you forgot!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Completely!&quot; said Ammon. &quot;But luckily it would
                        not have been fatal. I wrote Polly last week to send Edith something
                        appropriate and handsome to-day, with my card. But that touch from the woods
                        will be mighty effective. Thank you more than I can say. Aunt Anna and I
                        unpacked it to see the basket, and it was a beauty. She says you are always
                        doing things like that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I hope not!&quot; laughed Elnora. &quot;If
                        you&apos;d seen me sneaking out before dawn, not to waken mother and
                        coming in with moths to make her think I &apos;d been to the trees, you
                        &apos;d know it was a most especial occasion.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-347" n="337"/>
                    <p>Then Ammon understood two things. Elnora&apos;s mother did not know of
                        the early morning trip to the city, and the girl had come to meet him to
                        tell him so.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You were a brick to do it!&quot; he whispered as he closed the
                        gate behind them. &quot;I&apos;ll never forget you for it. Thank you
                        ever so much. You are too kind to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did not do that for you,&quot; said Elnora tersely.
                        &quot;I did it mostly to preserve my own self-respect. I saw you were
                        forgetting. If I did it for anything besides that, I did it for
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just look what I&apos;ve brought!&quot; said Ammon entering
                        the arbour and greeting Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Borrowed it of the Bird
                        Woman. And it isn&apos;t hers. A rare edition of Catocal with coloured
                        plates. I told her the best I could, and she said to try for Sappho here. I
                        suspect the Bird Woman will be out presently. She was all
                        excitement.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then they bent over the book together and with the mounted moth before them
                        determined her family. The Bird Woman did come later, and carried the moth
                        away to put into a book and Elnora and Ammon were freshly filled with
                        enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>So these days were the beginning of the weeks that followed. Six of them
                        flying on Time&apos;s wings, each filled to the brim with interest.
                        After June, the moth hunts grew less frequent; the fields and woods were
                        scoured for material for Elnora&apos;s grade work. The most absorbing
                        occupation they found was in carrying <pb id="VAA2373-348" n="338"/> out
                        Mrs. Comstock&apos;s suggestion to learn the vital thing for which each
                        month was distinctive, and make that the key to the nature work. They wrote
                        out a list of the months, opposite each the things all of them could suggest
                        which seemed to pertain to that month alone, and then tried to sift until
                        they found something typical. Mrs. Comstock was a great help. Her mother had
                        been Dutch and had brought from Holland numerous quaint sayings and
                        superstitions easily traceable to Pliny&apos;s Natural History; and in
                        Mrs. Comstock&apos;s early years in Ohio she had heard much Indian talk
                        among her elders, so she knew the signs of each season, and sometimes they
                        helped. Always her practical thought and sterling common-sense were useful.
                        When they. were afield until exhausted they came back to the cabin for food,
                        to prepare specimens and classify them, and to talk over the day. Sometimes
                        Ammon brought books and read while Elnora and her mother worked, and every
                        night Mrs. Comstock asked for the violin. Her perfect hunger for music was
                        sufficient evidence of how she had suffered without it. So the days crept
                        by, golden, filled with useful work and pure pleasure.</p>
                    <p>The grosbeak had led the family in the maple abroad and a second brood, in a
                        wild grape vine clambering over the well, was almost ready for flight. The
                        dust lay thick on the country roads, the days grew warmer; summer was just
                        poising to slip into fall, and Ammon stayed on, coming each day as if he had
                        belonged there always and expected to remain forever.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-349" n="339"/>
                    <p>One warm August afternoon Mrs. Comstock looked up from the ruffle on which
                        she was engaged to see a blue-coated messenger enter the gate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Philip Ammon here?&quot; asked the boy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have a message for him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is in the woods back of the cabin. I will ring the bell, and he
                        will come. Do you know if it is important?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Urgent,&quot; said the boy; &quot;I rode hard.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock stepped to the back door and clanged the dinner bell sharply,
                        paused a second, and rang again. In a short time Ammon and Elnora came down
                        the path on the run.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you ill, mother?&quot; cried Elnora.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock indicated the boy. &quot;There is an important message for
                        Philip,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Ammon muttered an excuse and tore open the telegram. His colour faded
                        slightly. &quot;I have to take the first train,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;My father is ill and I am needed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He handed the sheet to Elnora. &quot;I have about two hours, as I
                        remember the trains north, but my things are all over Uncle Doc&apos;s
                        house, so I must go at once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Elnora giving back the message.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is there anything I can do to help? Mother, get Philip a glass of
                        buttermilk to start on. I will gather what you have here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind. There is nothing of importance. I <pb id="VAA2373-350"
                            n="340"/> don&apos;t want to be hampered. I&apos;ll send for it
                        if I miss anything I need.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon drank the milk, said good-bye to Mrs. Comstock, repeatedly thanked her
                        for all her kindness, and turned to Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you walk to the edge of the Limberlost with me?&quot; he
                        asked. Elnora assented. Mrs. Comstock followed to the gate, urged him to
                        come again soon, and repeated her good-bye. Then she went back to the arbour
                        to await Elnora&apos;s return. As she watched down the road she smiled
                        softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had an idea he would speak to me first,&quot; she thought,
                        &quot;but this may change things some. He hasn&apos;t time. Elnora
                        will come back a happy girl, and she has good reason. He is a model young
                        man. Her lot will be mighty different from mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She picked up her embroidery and began setting dainty, precise little
                        stitches, possible only to certain women.</p>
                    <p>On the road Elnora spoke first. &quot;I do hope it is nothing
                        serious,&quot; she said. &quot;Is he usually strong?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quite strong,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I am not at all
                        alarmed but I am very much ashamed. I have been well enough for the last
                        month to have gone home and helped him with some critical cases that were
                        keeping him at work in this heat. I was enjoying myself so I
                        wouldn&apos;t offer to go, and he would not ask me to come, so long as
                        he could help it. I have allowed him to overtax himself until he is down,
                        and mother and Polly are north at our <pb id="VAA2373-351" n="341"/>
                        cottage. He&apos;s never been sick before, and it&apos;s probable I
                        am to blame that he is now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He intended you to stay this long when you came,&quot; urged
                        Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but it&apos;s hot in Chicago. I should have remembered
                        him. He is always thinking of me. Possibly he has needed me for days. I am
                        ashamed to go to him in splendid condition and admit that I was having such
                        a fine time I forgot to come home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have had a fine time, then?&quot; asked Elnora.</p>
                    <p>They had reached the fence. Ammon vaulted over to take a short cut across the
                        fields. He turned and looked at her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The best, the sweetest, and most wholesome time any man ever had in
                        this world,&quot; he said. &quot;Elnora, if I talked hours I
                        couldn&apos;t make you understand what a girl I think you are. I never
                        in all my life hated anything as I hate leaving you. It seems to me that I
                        have not strength to do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you have gotten anything worth while from me,&quot; said
                        Elnora, &quot;that should be it. Just to have strength to go to your
                        duty, and to go quickly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon caught the hand she held out to him in both his. &quot;Elnora,
                        these days we have had together, have they been sweet to you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Beautiful days!&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Each like a
                        perfect dream to be thought over and over all my life. Oh, they have been
                        the only really happy days I&apos;ve ever known; these days rich with
                        mother&apos;s love, and doing <pb id="VAA2373-352" n="342"/> useful work
                        with your help. Good-bye! You must hurry!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon gazed at her. He tried to drop her hand, and only clutched it closer.
                        Suddenly he drew her toward him. &quot;Elnora,&quot; he whispered,
                        &quot;will you kiss me good-bye?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora drew back and stared at him with wide eyes. &quot;I&apos;d
                        strike you sooner!&quot; she said. &quot;Have I ever said or done
                        anything in your presence that made you feel free to ask that, Philip
                        Ammon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot; panted Ammon. &quot;No! I think so much of you, I
                        just wanted to touch your lips once before I left you. You know
                        Elnora&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t distress yourself,&quot; said Elnora calmly,
                        &quot;I am broad enough to judge you sanely. I know what you mean. It
                        would be no harm to you. It would not matter to me, but here we will think
                        of someone else. Edith Carr would not want your lips to-morrow if she knew
                        they had touched mine to-day. I was wise to say &apos;Go
                        quickly!&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon still clung to her. &quot;Will you write me?&quot; he begged.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;There is nothing to say, save
                        good-bye. We can do that now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon held on. &quot;Promise that you will write me only one
                        letter,&quot; he urged. &quot;I want just one message from you to
                        lock in my desk, and keep always. Promise you will write once,
                        Elnora.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora looked straight into his eyes, and smiled <pb id="VAA2373-353" n="343"
                        /> serenely. &quot;If the talking trees tell me this winter, the secret
                        of how a man may grow perfect, I will write you what it is, Philip. In all
                        the time I have known you, I never have liked you so little.
                        Good-bye.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She drew away her hand and swiftly turned back to the road. Philip Ammon,
                        wordless, started toward Onabasha on a run.</p>
                    <p>Elnora crossed the road, climbed the fence and sought the shelter of their
                        own woods. She took a diagonal course and followed it until she came to the
                        path leading past the violet patch. She went down this hurriedly. Her hands
                        were clenched at her sides, her eyes dry and bright, her cheeks red-flushed,
                        and her breath coming fast. When she reached the patch she turned into it
                        and stood looking around her.</p>
                    <p>The mosses were dry, the flowers gone, weeds a foot high covered it. She
                        turned away and went on down the path until she was almost in sight of the
                        cabin.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock smiled and waited in the arbour until it dawned on her that
                        Elnora was a long time coming, so she went to the gate. The road stretched
                        away toward the Limberlost empty and lonely. Then she knew that Elnora had
                        gone into their own woods and would come in the back way. She could not
                        understand why the girl did not hurry to her with what she would have to
                        tell. She went out and wandered around the garden. Then she stepped into the
                        path and started back along the way leading to the woods, past the pool now
                        framed in a thick setting of yellow lilies. Then <pb id="VAA2373-354"
                            n="344"/> she saw, and stopped, gasping for breath. Her hands flew up
                        and her lined face grew ghastly. She stared at the sky and then at the
                        prostrate girl figure. Over and over she tried to speak, but only a dry
                        breath came. She turned and fled back to the garden.</p>
                    <p>In the familiar enclosure she gazed around her like a caged animal seeking
                        escape. The sun beat down on her bare head mercilessly, and mechanically she
                        moved over to the shade of a half-grown hickory tree that voluntarily had
                        sprouted by the milk house. At her feet lay an axe with which she made
                        kindlings for fires. She stooped and picked it up. That prone figure sobbing
                        in the grass caught her with a renewed spasm. She shut her eyes as if to
                        close it out. That made hearing so acute she felt certain she heard Elnora
                        moaning by the path. The eyes flew open. They fell squarely on a few
                        spindling tomato plants set too near the tree and stunted by its shade. Mrs.
                        Comstock whirled on the hickory and swung the axe. Her hair shook down, her
                        clothing became disarranged, in the heat the perspiration streamed, but
                        stroke fell on stroke until the tree crashed over, grazing a corner of the
                        milk house and smashing the garden fence on the east.</p>
                    <p>At the sound Elnora sprang to her feet and came running down the garden walk.
                        &quot;Mother!&quot; she cried. &quot;Mother! What in the world
                        are you doing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock wiped her ghastly face on her apron. &quot;I&apos;ve
                        laid out to cut that tree for years,&quot; she said. &quot;It <pb
                            id="VAA2373-355" n="345"/> shades the beets in the morning, and the
                        tomatoes in the afternoon!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora uttered one wild little cry and fled into her mother&apos;s arms.
                        &quot;Oh, mother!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;Will you ever forgive
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock&apos;s arms swept together in a tight grip around Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There isn&apos;t a thing on God&apos;s footstool from a to
                        izzard I won&apos;t forgive you, my precious girl!&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Tell mother what it is!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora lifted her wet face. &quot;He told me,&quot; she panted,
                        &quot;just as soon as he decently couldthat second day he told me.
                        Almost all his life he&apos;s been engaged to a girl at home. He never
                        cared anything about me. He was just interested in the moths and growing
                        strong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock&apos;s arms tightened. With a shaking hand she stroked the
                        bright hair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me, honey,&quot; she said. &quot;Is he to blame for a
                        single one of these tears?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not one!&quot; sobbed Elnora. &quot;Oh, mother, I
                        won&apos;t forgive you if you don&apos;t believe that. Not one! He
                        never said, or looked, or did anything all the world might not have known.
                        He likes me very much as a friend. He hated to go dreadfully!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora!&quot; the mother&apos;s head bent until the white
                        hair mingled with the brown. &quot;Elnora, why didn&apos;t you tell
                        me at first?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora caught her breath in a sharp snatch. &quot;I <pb id="VAA2373-356"
                            n="346"/> know I should!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;I will bear any
                        punishment for not, but I didn&apos;t feel as if I possibly could. I was
                        afraid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Afraid of what?&quot; the shaking hand was on the hair again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Afraid you wouldn&apos;t let him come!&quot; panted Elnora.
                        &quot;And, oh, mother, I wanted him so!&quot;</p>

                    <p>F<hi rend="sc">OR</hi> the next week Mrs. Comstock and Elnora worked so hard
                        there was no time to talk, and they were compelled to sleep from physical
                        exhaustion. Neither of them made any pretense of eating, for they could not
                        swallow without a great effort, so they drank milk and worked. Elnora went
                        on setting bait for Catacol and Sphingin, which, unlike the big moths of
                        June, live several months. She took all the dragon flies and butterflies she
                        could, and when she went over the list for the man of India, she found, to
                        her amazement, that with Ammon&apos;s help she once more had it complete
                        save a pair of Yellow Emperors.</p>
                    <p>This circumstance was so amazing she had a fleeting thought of writing Ammon
                        and asking him to see if he could not secure her a pair. She did tell the
                        Bird Woman, and from every source at her command she tried to complete the
                        series with these moths, and could not find any for sale.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think the mills of the Gods are grinding this grist,&quot;
                            <pb id="VAA2373-358" n="348"/> said Elnora, &quot;and we might as
                        well wait patiently until they choose to send a Yellow Emperor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock invented work. When she had nothing more to do, she hoed in the
                        garden although the earth was hard and dry and there were no plants that
                        really needed attention. Then came a notification that Elnora would be
                        compelled to attend a week&apos;s session of the Teachers&apos;
                        Institute held at the county seat twenty miles north of Onabasha the
                        following week. That gave them something of which to think and real work to
                        do. Elnora was requested to bring her violin. As she was on the programme of
                        one of the most important sessions for a talk on nature work in grade
                        schools, she was driven to prepare her speech, and to select and practise
                        some music. Her mother turned her attention to clothing.</p>
                    <p>They went to Onabasha together and purchased a simple and appropriate fall
                        suit and hat, goods for a dainty little coloured frock, and a dress skirt
                        and several fancy waists. Margaret Sinton came down and the sewing began.
                        When everything was finished and packed, Elnora kissed her mother good-bye
                        at the depot, and the train pulled out. Mrs. Comstock went into the
                        waiting-room and dropped into a seat to rest. Her heart was so sore her
                        whole right side felt tender. She was half starved for the food she had no
                        appetite to take. She had worked in dogged determination until she was
                        exhausted. For a time she simply sat and rested. Then she began to think.
                        She was glad Elnora had gone where she would be compelled to fix her mind on
                        other <pb id="VAA2373-359" n="349"/> things for a few days. She remembered
                        the girl had said she wanted to go.</p>
                    <p>School would begin the following week. She thought over what Elnora would
                        have to do to accomplish her work successfully. She would be compelled to
                        arise at six o&apos;clock, walk three miles through varying weather,
                        lead the high school orchestra, and then put in the rest of the day
                        travelling from building to building over the city, teaching a specified
                        length of time every week in each room. She must have her object lessons
                        ready, and she must do a certain amount of practising with the orchestra.
                        Then a cold lunch at noon, and a three-mile walk at night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock, &quot;To get through that
                        the girl would have to be made of cast-iron. I wonder how I can help her
                        best?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She plunged in deepest thought again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The less she sees of what she&apos;s been having all summer,
                        the sooner she&apos;ll feel better about it,&quot; she muttered.</p>
                    <p>She arose, went to the bank and inquired for the cashier.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to know just how I am fixed here,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>The cashier laughed. &quot;Well, you haven&apos;t been in a
                        hurry,&quot; he replied. &quot;We have been ready for you any time
                        these twenty years, but you didn&apos;t seem to pay much attention. Your
                        account is rather flourishing. Interest, when it gets to compounding is
                        quite a money breeder. Come back here to a table and I will show you your
                        balances.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Comstock sank into a chair and waited while the cashier read a jumble of
                        figures to her. It meant that her deposits had exceeded her expenses from
                        one to three hundred dollars a year, according to the cattle, sheep, hogs,
                        poultry, butter, and eggs she had sold. The aggregate of these sums had been
                        compounding interest throughout the years. Mrs. Comstock stared at the total
                        with dazed and unbelieving eyes. Through her sick heart rushed the
                        realization, that if she merely had stood before that wicket and asked one
                        question, she would have known that all those bitter years of skimping for
                        Elnora and herself had been unnecessary. She arose and went back to the
                        depot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to send a message,&quot; she said. She picked up the
                        pencil and, with rash extravagance, wrote, &quot;Found money at bank
                        didn&apos;t know about. If you want to go to college, come on first
                        train and get ready.&quot; She hesitated a second and then she said to
                        herself grimly, &quot;Yes, I&apos;ll pay for that, too,&quot;
                        and recklessly added, &quot;With love, Mother.&quot; Then she sat
                        waiting for the answer. It came in less than an hour. &quot;Going to
                        teach this winter. With dearest love, Elnora.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock held the message a long time. When she arose she was ravenously
                        hungry, but the pain in her heart was a little easier. She went to a
                        restaurant and got some food, then to a dressmaker where she ordered four
                        dresses; two very plain every-day ones, a serviceable dark gray cloth suit,
                        and a soft light gray silk with touches of lavender and lace. She made a <pb
                            id="VAA2373-361" n="351"/> heavy list of purchases at Brownlees, and the
                        remainder of the day she did business in her direct and spirited way. At
                        night she was so tired she scarcely could walk home, but she built a fire
                        and cooked and ate a hearty meal.</p>
                    <p>Later she went out by the west fence and gathered an armful of tansy which
                        she boiled to a thick green tea. Then she stirred in oatmeal until it was a
                        stiff paste. She spread a sheet over her bed and began tearing strips of old
                        muslin. She bandaged each hand and arm with the mixture and plastered the
                        soggy, evil-smelling stuff in a thick poultice over her face and neck. She
                        was so tired she had to sleep, and when she awoke she was half skinned. She
                        bathed her face and hands, did the work and went back to town, coming home
                        at night to go through the same process.</p>
                    <p>By the third morning she was a raw even red, the fourth she had faded to a
                        brilliant pink under the soothing influence of a cream recommended. That day
                        came a letter from Elnora saying that she would remain where she was until
                        Saturday morning, and then come to Ellen Brownlee&apos;s at Onabasha and
                        stay for the Saturday&apos;s session of teachers to arrange their
                        year&apos;s work. Sunday was Ellen&apos;s last day at home, and she
                        wanted Elnora very much. She had to get together the orchestra and practise
                        them Sunday; and could not come home until after school Monday night. That
                        suited Mrs. Comstock, and she at once answered the letter saying so.</p>
                    <p>The next day Mrs. Comstock was a pale pink, and <pb id="VAA2373-362" n="352"
                        /> the following a delicate porcelain white. That day she went to a
                        hairdresser and had the great rope of snowy hair which covered her scalp
                        washed, dressed, and fastened with such pins and combs as were decided to be
                        most becoming. She took samples of her dresses, went to a milliner, and
                        bought a street hat to match her suit, and a gray satin with lavender
                        orchids to wear with the silk dress. Her last investment was a loose coat of
                        soft gray broadcloth with white lining, and touches of lavender on the
                        embroidered collar, and gray gloves to match.</p>
                    <p>Then she went home, rested and worked by turns until Monday. When school
                        closed on that evening, and Elnora, so tired she almost trembled, came down
                        the long walk after a late session of teachers&apos; meeting, a
                        messenger boy stopped her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s a lady wants to see you most important. I am to
                        take you to the place,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Elnora groaned. She could not imagine who wanted her, but there was nothing
                        to do but go and find out, tired and anxious to see her mother as she was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is the place,&quot; said the boy, and went his way
                        whistling. Elnora was three blocks from the high school building on the same
                        street. She was before a quaint old house, fresh with paint and covered with
                        vines. There was a long wide lot, grass-covered, closely set with trees, and
                        a barn and chicken park at the back that seemed to be occupied. Elnora
                        stepped on the veranda which was furnished with straw rugs, bent-hickory
                        chairs, hanging <pb id="VAA2373-363" n="353"/> baskets, and a table with a
                        work-box and magazines, and knocked at the screen door.</p>
                    <p>Inside she could see bare polished floors, walls freshly papered in low-toned
                        harmonious colours, straw rugs and madras curtains. It seemed to be a
                        restful, homelike place to which she had come, and a second later down an
                        open stairway came a tall, dark-eyed woman with cheeks faintly pink and a
                        crown of fluffy snow-white hair. She wore a lavender gingham dress with
                        white collar and cuffs, and she called as she advanced, &quot;That
                        screen isn&apos;t latched! Open it and come see your brand-new mother,
                        my girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora stepped inside the door. &quot;Mother!&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;You my mother! I don&apos;t believe it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you better!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock, &quot;because
                        it&apos;s true! You said you wished I were like the other
                        girls&apos; mothers, and I&apos;ve shot as close the mark as I could
                        without any practice. I thought that walk would be too much for you this
                        winter, so I just rented this house and moved in, to be near you, and help
                        more in case I&apos;m needed. I&apos;ve only lived here a day, but I
                        like it so well I&apos;ve a mortal big notion to buy the
                        place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, mother!&quot; protested Elnora, clinging to her
                        wonderingly. &quot;You are perfectly beautiful, and this house is a
                        little paradise, but how will we ever pay for it? We can&apos;t afford
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph! Have you forgotten I telegraphed you I&apos;d found some
                        money I didn&apos;t know about? All I&apos;ve <pb id="VAA2373-364"
                            n="354"/> done is paid for, and plenty more to settle for all I propose
                        to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock glanced around with supreme satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I may get homesick as a pup before spring,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;but if I do I can go back. If I don&apos;t, I&apos;ll sell
                        some timber and put a few oil wells where they don&apos;t show much. I
                        can have land enough cleared for a few fields and put a tenant on our farm,
                        and we will buy this and settle here. It&apos;s for sale.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t look it, but you&apos;ve surely gone
                        mad!&quot; exclaimed Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just the reverse, my girl,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock,
                        &quot;I&apos;ve gone sane. If you are going to undertake this work,
                        you must be convenient to it. And your mother should be where she can see
                        that you are properly dressed, fed, and cared for. This is ourlet me
                        thinkreception room. How do you like it? This door leads to your workroom
                        and study. I didn&apos;t do much there because I wasn&apos;t sure of
                        my way. But I knew you would want a rug, curtains, table, shelves for books,
                        and a case for your specimens, so I had a carpenter shelve and enclose that
                        end of it. &apos;Looks pretty neat to me. The dining room and kitchen
                        are back, one of the cows in the barn, and some chickens in the coop. I
                        understand that none of the other girls&apos; mothers milk a cow, so a
                        neighbour boy will tend to ours for a third of the milk. There are three
                        bedrooms, and a bath upstairs. Go take one, get in some fresh clothes, <pb
                            id="VAA2373-365" n="355"/> and come to supper. You can find your room
                        because your things are in it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora kissed her mother over and over, and hurried upstairs. She identified
                        her room by the dressing-case. There was a pretty rug, and curtains, white
                        iron bed, plain and rocking chairs to match her case, a shirtwaist chest,
                        and the big closet was filled with her old clothing and several new dresses.
                        She found the bathroom, bathed, dressed in fresh linen and went down to a
                        supper that was an evidence of Mrs. Comstock&apos;s highest art in
                        cooking. Elnora was so hungry she ate her first real meal in two weeks. But
                        the bites went down slowly because she forgot about them in watching her
                        mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How on earth did you do it?&quot; she said at last. I always
                        thought you were naturally brown as a nut.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that was just tan and sunburn!&quot; explained Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;I always knew I was white underneath it. I hated to
                        shade my face because I hadn&apos;t anything but a sunbonnet, and I
                        couldn&apos;t stand for it to touch my ears, so I went bareheaded and
                        took all the colour I accumulated. But when I began to think of moving you
                        in to your work, I saw I must put up an appearance that wouldn&apos;t
                        disgrace you, so I thought I&apos;d best remove the crust. It took some
                        time, and I hope I may die before I ever endure the feel and the smell of
                        the stuff I used again, but it skinned me nicely. What you now see is my own
                        with just a little dust of rice powder, for protection. I&apos;m sort of
                        tender yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And your lovely, lovely hair?&quot; breathed Elnora.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-366" n="356"/>
                    <p>&quot;Hair dresser did that!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;It
                        cost like smoke. But I watched her, and with a little help from you I can
                        wash it alone next time, though it will be hard work. I let her monkey with
                        it until she said she had found &apos;my style.&apos; Then I tore it
                        down and had her show me how to build it up again three times. I thought my
                        arms would drop. When I paid the bill for her work, the time I&apos;d
                        taken, the pins, and combs she&apos;d used, I nearly had heart failure,
                        but I didn&apos;t turn a hair before her. I just smiled at her sweetly
                        and said, &apos;How reasonable you are!&apos; Come to think of it,
                        she was! She might have charged me ten dollars for what she did just as well
                        as nine seventy-five. I couldn&apos;t have helped myself. I had made no
                        bargain to begin on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then Elnora leaned back in her chair and shouted, in a gust of hearty
                        laughter, and a little of the ache ceased in her breast. There was no time
                        to think, the remainder of that evening, she was so tired she had to sleep,
                        and her mother did not awaken her until she barely had time to dress,
                        breakfast and get to school. There was nothing in the new life to remind her
                        of the old, while it seemed as if there never came a minute for
                        retrospection, but her mother appeared on the scene with more work, or some
                        entertaining thing to do.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock invited Elnora&apos;s friends to visit her, and proved
                        herself a bright and interesting hostess. She digested a subject before she
                        spoke; and when she advanced a view, her point was sure to be original and
                            <pb id="VAA2373-367" n="357"/> tersely expressed. Before three months
                        people waited to hear what she had to say. She kept her appearance so in
                        mind that she made a handsome and a distinguished figure.</p>
                    <p>Elnora never mentioned Philip Ammon, neither did Mrs. Comstock. Early in
                        December came a note and a big box from him. It contained several books on
                        nature subjects which would be a great help in school work, a number of
                        conveniences Elnora could not afford, and a pair of glass-covered plaster
                        casts, for each large moth she had. In these the upper and under wings of
                        male and female showed. Ammon explained that she would break her specimens
                        easily, carrying them about in boxes. He had seen these and thought they
                        would be of use. Elnora was delighted with them, and at once began the
                        tedious process of softening the mounted moths and fitting them to the casts
                        moulded to receive them. Her time was so taken in school, she progressed
                        slowly, so her mother undertook this work. After trying one or two very
                        common ones she learned to handle the most delicate with ease. She took keen
                        pride in relaxing the tense moths, fitting them to the cases, polishing the
                        glass covers to the last degree and sealing them. The results were beautiful
                        to behold.</p>
                    <p>Soon after Elnora wrote Ammon: <text>

                                        collection for the man of India, save a Yellow Emperor. I
                                        have tried everywhere I know, so has the Bird Woman. We
                                        cannot find a pair for sale. Fate is against me, at least
                                        this season. I shall have to wait until next year and try
                                        again.</p>
                                    <p>Thank you very much for helping me with my collection and for
                                        the books and things.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Ammon was disappointed over that note and instead of keeping it he tore it
                        into bits and dropped them into the waste basket.</p>
                    <p>That was precisely what Elnora hoped he would do. Christmas brought beautiful
                        cards of greeting to Mrs. Comstock and Elnora, Easter others, and the year
                        went rapidly toward spring. Elnora&apos;s work had been intensely
                        absorbing, and she had gone into it with all her power. She had made it a
                        wonderful success and won new friends. Mrs. Comstock had helped in every way
                        she could, and she was very popular also.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the winter they had enjoyed the city thoroughly, and the change of
                        life it afforded, but signs of spring did wonderful things to the hearts of
                        the countrybred women. A restlessness began on bright February days, calmed
                        during March storms and attacked full force in April. When neither could
                        bear it any longer they were forced to discuss the matter and admit they
                        were growing ill with pure homesickness. They decided to keep the city house
                        during the summer, but to go back to the farm to live just as soon as school
                        closed.</p>
                    <p>So Mrs. Comstock would prepare breakfast and lunch <pb id="VAA2373-369"
                            n="359"/> and then slip away to the farm to make up beds in her ploughed
                        garden, plant seeds, trim and tend her flowers, and prepare the cabin for
                        occupancy. Then she would go home and make the evening as cheerful as
                        possible for Elnora; in these days she lived only for the girl.</p>
                    <p>Both of them were glad when the last of May came and the schools closed. They
                        packed the books and clothing they wished to take into a wagon and walked
                        across the fields to the old cabin. As they approached it, Mrs. Comstock
                        said to Elnora, &quot;You are sure you won&apos;t be lonely
                        here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora knew what she really meant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quite sure,&quot; she said. &quot;For a time last fall I
                        was glad to be away, but that all wore out with the winter. Spring made me
                        homesick as I could be. I can scarcely wait until we get back
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So they began that summer just as they had begun all otherswith work. But
                        both of them took a new joy in everything, and the violin sang by the hour
                        in the twilight.</p>

                    <p>E<hi rend="sc">DITH</hi> C<hi rend="sc">ARR</hi> stood in a vine-enclosed
                        side veranda of the Lake Shore Club House waiting while Philip Ammon gave
                        some important orders. In a few days she would sail for Paris to select a
                        wonderful trousseau she had planned for her marriage in October. To-night
                        Philip was giving a club dance in her honour, and three hundred of their
                        friends were bidden to share their happiness. Philip had spent days in
                        devising new and exquisite effects in decorations, entertainment, and
                        supper. Weeks before the favoured guests had been notified. Days before they
                        had received the invitations asking them to participate in this
                        entertainment by Philip Ammon in honour of Miss Carr. They spoke of it as
                        &apos;Phil&apos;s&apos; dance for Edith!</p>
                    <p>As Edith Carr stood waiting, she smiled softly. She could hear the rumble of
                        carriages and the panting of automobiles as in a steady stream they rolled
                        to the front entrance. She could catch glimpses of floating draperies of
                        gauze and lace, the flash of jewels, and the passing of exquisite colour.
                        Everyone was newly <pb id="VAA2373-371" n="361"/> arrayed in her honour in
                        the loveliest clothing, and the most expensive jewels they could command. As
                        she thought of it she lifted her head a trifle higher and her eyes flashed
                        proudly.</p>
                    <p>She was robed in a French creation suggested and designed by Philip. He had
                        said to her, &quot;I know a competent judge who says the distinctive
                        feature of June is her exquisite big night moths. I want you to be the very
                        essence of June that night, as you will be the embodiment of love. Be a
                        moth. The most beautiful of them is either the pale green Luna or the Yellow
                        Imperialis. Be my moon lady, or my gold Empress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took her to the museum and showed her the moths. She instantly decided on
                        the yellow. Secretly because she knew the shades would make her more
                        startlingly beautiful than any other colour. To him she said, &quot;A
                        moon lady seems so far away and cold. I would be of earth and very near on
                        that night. I choose the Empress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So she matched the colours exactly, wrote out the idea and forwarded the
                        order to Paquin. To-night when Philip Ammon came for her, he stood
                        speechless for a minute and then silently kissed her hands.</p>
                    <p>For she stood tall, lithe, of grace inborn, her dark waving hair high piled
                        and crossed by gold bands studded with amethyst and at one side an enamelled
                        lavender orchid rimmed with diamonds, which flashed and sparkled. The soft
                        yellow robe of lightest weight velvet fitted her form perfectly, while from
                        each shoulder <pb id="VAA2373-372" n="362"/> fell a great velvet wing lined
                        with lavender, and flecked with embroidery of that colour in imitation of
                        the moth. Around her throat was a wonderful necklace and on her arms were
                        bracelets of gold set with amethyst and rimmed with diamonds. Philip had
                        said that her gloves, fan, and slippers must be lavender, because the feet
                        of the moth were that colour. These accessories had been made to order and
                        embroidered with gold. It had been arranged that her mother,
                        Philip&apos;s, and a few best friends should receive his guests. She was
                        to appear when she led the grand march with Philip Ammon. Miss Carr was as
                        positive that she would be the most beautiful, and most exquisitely gowned
                        woman present as she was of life. In her heart she thought of herself as
                        &quot;Imperialis Regalis,&quot; as the Yellow Empress. In a few
                        moments she would stun her world into feeling it as Philip Ammon had done,
                        for she had taken pains that the history of her costume should be whispered
                        to a few who would give it circulation. She lifted her head proudly and
                        waited, for was not Philip planning something unusual and unsurpassed in her
                        honour? Then she smiled.</p>
                    <p>But in all the fragmentary thoughts crossing her brain the one that never
                        came was that of Philip Ammon as the Emperor. Philip the king of her heart,
                        and at least her equal in all things. She was the Empressyes, but Philip was
                        a mere man, to devise entertainments, to provide luxuries, to humour whims,
                        to kiss hands!</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-373" n="363"/>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, my luck!&quot; cried a voice behind her.</p>
                    <p>Edith Carr turned and smiled exquisitely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you were on the ocean,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I only reached the dock,&quot; replied the man. &quot;When
                        I had a letter that recalled me by the first limited.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! Important business?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The only business of any importance in all the world to me.
                        I&apos;m triumphant that I came. Edith, you are the most superb woman in
                        every respect that I have ever seen. One glimpse is worth the whole
                        journey.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You like my dress?&quot; she moved toward him and turned,
                        lifting her arms. &quot;Do you know what it is intended to
                        represent?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, Polly Ammon told me. I knew when I heard about it how you
                        would look, so I started a sleuth hunt, to get the first peep. Edith, I can
                        become intoxicated just with looking at you to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He half-closed his eyes and smilingly stared straight at her. He was taller
                        than she, a lean man, with close-cropped light hair, steel gray eyes, a
                        square chin and &quot;man of the world&quot; written all over him.</p>
                    <p>Edith Carr flushed. &quot;I thought you realized when you went away that
                        you were to stop that, Hart Henderson,&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did, but this letter of which I tell you called me back to start
                        it all over again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She came a step closer. &quot;Who wrote that letter, and what did it
                        contain concerning me?&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-374" n="364"/>
                    <p>&quot;One of your most intimate chums wrote it. It contained the hazard
                        that possibly I had given up too soon. It said that in a fit of petulance
                        you had broken your engagement with Ammon twice this winter, and he had come
                        back because he knew you did not really mean it. I thought hard there on the
                        dock when I read that, and my boat sailed without me. I argued that anything
                        so weak as an engagement twice broken and patched up again was a mighty
                        frail affair indeed, and likely to smash completely at any time, so I came
                        on the run. I said once I would not see you marry any other man. Because I
                        could not bear it, I planned to go into exile of any sort to escape that. I
                        have changed my mind. I have come back to haunt you until the ceremony is
                        over. Then I go, not before. I was insane!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The girl laughed merrily. &quot;Not half so insane as you are now,
                        Hart!&quot; she cried gaily. &quot;You know that Philip Ammon has
                        been devoted to me all my life. Well, now I&apos;ll tell you something
                        else, because this looks serious for you. I love him with all my heart. Not
                        while he lives shall he know it, and I will laugh at him if you tell him,
                        but the fact remains: I intend to marry him, but no doubt I shall tease him
                        constantly. It&apos;s good for a man to be uncertain. If you could see
                        Ammon&apos;s face at the quarterly return of his ring, you would
                        understand the fun of it. You had better have taken your boat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Possibly,&quot; said Henderson calmly. &quot;But you are
                        the only woman in the world for me, and while you are <pb id="VAA2373-375"
                            n="365"/> free, as I now see my light, I stay by you. You know the old
                        adage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m not &apos;free&apos;!&quot; cried
                        Edith Carr. &quot;I&apos;m just telling you I am not. This night is
                        my public acknowledgment that Phil and I are promised, as our world has
                        surmised since we were children. That promise is an actual fact, because of
                        what I just have told you. My little fits of temper don&apos;t count
                        with Phil. He&apos;s been raised on them. In fact, I often invent one in
                        a perfect calm to see him perform. He is the most amusing spectacle. But,
                        please, please, do understand that I love him, and always will, and that we
                        will be married.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just the same, I&apos;ll wait and see it an accomplished
                        fact,&quot; said Henderson. &quot;And, Edith, because I love you,
                        with the sort of love it is worth a woman&apos;s while to inspire, I
                        want your happiness before my own. So I am going to say this to you, for I
                        never dreamed you were capable of the feeling you have displayed for Phil.
                        If you do love him, and have loved him always, a disappointment would cut
                        you deeper than you know. Go careful from now on! Don&apos;t strain that
                        patched engagement of yours any further. I&apos;ve known Philip all my
                        life. I&apos;ve known him through boyhood, in college, and since. All
                        men respect him. Where the rest of us confess our sins, he stands clean. You
                        can go to his arms with nothing to forgive. Mark this thing! I have heard
                        him say, &apos;Edith is my slogan,&apos; and I have seen him march
                        home strong in the strength of his love for you, in the face of temptations
                        before which every <pb id="VAA2373-376" n="366"/> other man of us fell.
                        Before the gods! that ought to be worth something to a girl, if she really
                        is the delicate, sensitive, refined thing she would have man believe. It
                        would take a woman with the organism of an ostrich to endure some of the men
                        here to-night, if she knew them as I do; but Phil is sound to the core. So
                        this is what I would say to you. First, your instincts are right in loving
                        him, why not let him feel it in the ways a woman knows? Second,
                        don&apos;t break your engagement again. As men know the man, any of us
                        would be afraid to the soul. He loves you, yes! He is longsuffering for you,
                        yes! But men know he has a limit. When the limit is reached, he will stand
                        fast, and all the powers can&apos;t move him. You don&apos;t seem to
                        think it, but you can go too far!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that all?&quot; laughed Edith Carr sarcastically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, there is one thing more,&quot; said Henderson.
                        &quot;Here or hereafter, now and so long as I breathe, I am your slave.
                        You can do anything you choose and know that I will kneel before you again.
                        So carry this in the depths of your heart; now or at any time, in any place
                        or condition, merely lift your hand, and I will come. Anything you want of
                        me, that thing will I do. I am going to wait; if you need me, it is not
                        necessary to speak; only give me the faintest sign. All your life I will be
                        somewhere near you waiting for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Idjit! You rave!&quot; laughed Edith Carr. &quot;How you
                        would frighten me! What a bugbear you would raise! Be sensible and go find
                        what keeps Phil. I <pb id="VAA2373-377" n="367"/> was waiting patiently, but
                        my patience is going. I won&apos;t look nearly so well as I do now when
                        it is gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At that instant Philip Ammon entered. He was in full evening dress and
                        exceptionally handsome. &quot;Everything is ready,&quot; he said;
                        &quot;they are waiting for us to lead the march. It is formed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Edith Carr smiled entrancingly. &quot;Do you think I am ready?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip looked what he thought, and offered his arm. Edith Carr nodded
                        carelessly to Henderson, and moved away. Servants parted the curtains and
                        the Yellow Empress bowing right and left, swept the length of the ballroom
                        and took her place at the head of the formed procession. The great open
                        dancing pavilion was draped with yellow silk caught up with lilac flowers.
                        Every corner was filled with bloom of those colours. The music was played by
                        harpers dressed in yellow and violet, and the ball opened.</p>
                    <p>The midnight supper was served with the same colours and the last half of the
                        programme was well under way. Never had girl been more complimented and
                        petted in the same length of time than Edith Carr. Every minute she seemed
                        to grow more worthy of praise. A partners&apos; dance was called and the
                        floor was filled with couples waiting for the music. Ammon stood whispering
                        delightful things to Edith facing him. From out of the night, in at the wide
                        front entrance to the pavilion there swept in slow wavering flight a great
                        yellow moth and fluttered toward the centre cluster of glaring electric <pb
                            id="VAA2373-378" n="368"/> lights. Philip Ammon and Edith Carr saw it at
                        the same instant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, isn&apos;t that?&quot; she began excitedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a Yellow Emperor! This is fate!&quot; cried
                        Ammon. &quot;The last one Elnora needs for her collection. I must have
                        it! Excuse me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He ran toward the light. &quot;Hats! Handkerchiefs! Fans!
                        Anything!&quot; he panted. &quot;Everyone hold up something and stop
                        that! It&apos;s a moth; I&apos;ve got to catch it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He wants it for Edith!&quot; ran in a murmur around the hall.
                        The girl&apos;s face flushed, while she bit her lip in vexation.</p>
                    <p>Instantly everyone began holding up something to keep the moth from flying
                        back into the night. One fan held straight before it served, and the moth
                        gently settled on it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold steady!&quot; cried Ammon. &quot;Don&apos;t move
                        for your life!&quot; he rushed toward the moth made a quick sweep and
                        held it up between his fingers. &quot;All right!&quot; he called.
                        &quot;Thanks, everyone! Excuse me a minute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He ran to the office.</p>
                    <p>&quot;An ounce of gasolene, quick!&quot; he ordered. &quot;A
                        cigar box, a cork, and the glue bottle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He poured some glue into the bottom of the box, set the cork in it firmly,
                        dashed the gasolene over the moth repeatedly, pinned it to the cork, poured
                        the remainder, of the liquid over it, closed the box, and fastened it. Then
                        he laid a bill on the counter.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-379" n="369"/>
                    <p>&quot;Pack that box with cork around it, in one twice its size, tie
                        securely and express to this address at once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He scribbled on a sheet of paper and shoved it over.</p>
                    <p>&quot;On your honour, will you do that faithfully as I say?&quot; he
                        asked the clerk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; was the reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then keep the change,&quot; called Ammon as he ran back to the
                        pavilion.</p>
                    <p>Edith Carr stood where he left her, thinking rapidly. She heard the murmur
                        that went up when Philip started to capture the exquisite golden creature
                        she was impersonating. She saw the flash of surprise that went over
                        unrestrained faces when he ran from the room, without even showing it to
                        her. &quot;The last one Elnora needs,&quot; rang in her ears. He had
                        told her that he helped collect moths the previous summer, but she had
                        understood that the Bird Woman, with whose work Miss Carr was familiar,
                        wanted them to put in a book.</p>
                    <p>He had spoken of a country girl he had met who played the violin wonderfully,
                        and at times, he had showed a disposition to exalt her as a standard of
                        woman-hood. Miss Carr had ignored what he said, and talked of something
                        else. But that girl&apos;s name had been Elnora. It was she who was
                        collecting moths! No doubt she was the competent judge who was responsible
                        for the yellow costume Philip had devised. Had Edith Carr been in her room,
                        she would have torn off the dress at the thought.</p>
                    <p>Being in a circle of her best friends, which to her <pb id="VAA2373-380"
                            n="370"/> meant her keenest rivals and harshest critics, she grew rigid
                        with anger. Her breath hurt her paining chest. No one thought to speak to
                        the musicians and, seeing the floor filled, they began the waltz. Only half
                        the guests could see what had happened, and at once the others formed and
                        commenced to dance. Laughing couples came sweeping past her.</p>
                    <p>Edith Carr grew very white as she stood alone. Her lips turned pale, while
                        her dark eyes flamed with anger. She stood perfectly still where Philip had
                        left her, and the approaching men guided their partners around her, while
                        the girls, looking back, could be seen making exclamations of surprise.</p>
                    <p>The idolized only daughter of the Carr family hoped that she would drop dead
                        from mortification, but nothing happened. She was too perverse to step aside
                        laughingly and say that she was waiting for Philip. Then came Tom Levering
                        dancing with Polly Ammon. Being in the scales with the Ammon family, Tom
                        scented trouble from afar, so he whispered to Polly, &quot;Edith is
                        standing in the middle of the floor, and she&apos;s awful mad about
                        something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That won&apos;t hurt her,&quot; laughed Polly.
                        &quot;It&apos;s an old pose of hers. She knows she looks superb when
                        she is angry, so she keeps herself furious half the time on
                        purpose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She looks like the mischief!&quot; answered Tom.
                        &quot;Hadn&apos;t we better steer over and wait with her?
                        She&apos;s the ugliest sight I ever saw!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-381" n="371"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Tom!&quot; cried Polly. &quot;Stop, quickly!&quot;</p>
                    <p>They hurried to Edith.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, dear,&quot; said Polly. &quot;We are going to wait
                        with you until Phil gets back. Let&apos;s go for a drink. I am so
                        thirsty!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, do!&quot; begged Tom, offering his arm.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s get out of here until Phil comes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was an opportunity to laugh and walk away, but Edith Carr would not
                        accept it. Anger only seemed to flame higher.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My betrothed left me here,&quot; she said. &quot;Here I
                        shall remain until he returns for me, and thenhe will be my betrothed no
                        longer!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Polly grasped Edith&apos;s arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Edith!&quot; she implored. &quot;Don&apos;t make a
                        scene here, and to-night. Edith, this has been the loveliest dance ever
                        given at the club house. Everyone is saying so. Edith! Darling, do come!
                        Phil will be back in a second. He can explain! It&apos;s only a breath
                        since I saw him go out. I thought he had returned.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As Polly panted these disjointed ejaculations, Tom Levering began to grow
                        angry on her account.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He has been gone just long enough to show every one of his guests
                        that he will leave me standing alone, like a neglected fool, for any passing
                        whim of his. Explain! His explanation would sound well! Do you know for whom
                        he caught that moth? It is being sent to a girl he flirted with all last
                        summer. It has just <pb id="VAA2373-382" n="372"/> occurred to me that the
                        dress I am wearing is her suggestion. Let him try to explain!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Speech unloosed the fountain. She stripped off her gloves to free her hands.
                        At that instant the dancers parted to admit Philip. Instinctively they
                        stopped as they approached and with wondering faces walled in Edith and
                        Philip, Polly and Tom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mighty good of you to wait!&quot; cried Ammon, his face beaming
                        with delight over his success in capturing the Yellow Emperor. &quot;I
                        thought when I heard the music you were going on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did you think I was going on?&quot; demanded Edith Carr in
                        frigid tones.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you would step aside and wait a few seconds for me, or
                        dance with Henderson. It was most important to have that moth. It just
                        completes a valuable collection for a person who needs the money.
                        Come!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He held out his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I &apos;step aside&apos; for no one!&quot; stormed
                        Edith Carr. &quot;I await no other girl&apos;s pleasure! You may
                        &apos;complete the collection&apos; with that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She drew her engagement ring from her finger and reached to place it in one
                        of Philip&apos;s outstretched hands. Ammon saw and drew back. Instantly
                        Edith dropped the ring. As it fell, almost instinctively Philip caught it in
                        air. With amazed face he looked closely at Edith Carr. Her distorted
                        features were scarcely recognizable.</p>
                    <p>He held the ring toward her.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-383" n="373"/>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, for the love of mercy, wait until I can explain,&quot;
                        he begged. &quot;Put on your ring and let me tell you how it
                        is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know perfectly &apos;how it is,&apos;&quot; she
                        answered. &quot;I never will wear that ring again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You won&apos;t even hear what I have to say? You won&apos;t
                        take back your ring?&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never! Your conduct is infamous!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come to think of it,&quot; said Ammon deliberately,
                        &quot;it is infamous to cut a girl, who has danced all her life, out of
                        a few measures of a waltz. As for asking forgiveness for so black a sin as
                        picking up a moth, and starting it to a friend who lives by collecting them,
                        I don&apos;t see how I could! I have not been gone three minutes by the
                        clock, Edith. Put on your ring and finish the dance like a dear
                        girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He thrust the glittering ruby into her fingers and again held out his arms.
                        She dropped the ring, and it rolled some distance from them. Henderson
                        followed its shining course, and caught it before it was lost.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You really mean it?&quot; demanded Ammon in a voice as cold as
                        hers ever had been.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know I mean it!&quot; cried Edith Carr.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I accept your decision in the presence of these
                        witnesses,&quot; said Philip Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is my father?&quot; he asked of those around them. The
                        elder Ammon with a distressed face hurried to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father, take my place,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Excuse me
                        to <pb id="VAA2373-384" n="374"/> my guests. Ask all my friends to forgive
                        me. I am going out for a time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned and walked from the pavilion. As he went Hart Henderson rushed to
                        Edith Carr and forced the ring into her fingers. &quot;Edith, quick!
                        Come, quick!&quot; he implored. &quot;There&apos;s just time to
                        catch him. If you let him go that way, he never will return in this world.
                        Remember what I told you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Great prophet! aren&apos;t you, Hart?&quot; she sneered.
                        &quot;Who wants him to return? If that ring is thrust upon me again I
                        shall fling it into the lake. Signal the musicians to begin, and take this
                        dance with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson put the ring into his pocket, and began the dance. He could feel
                        the muscular spasms of the girl in his arms, her face was cold and hard, but
                        her breath burned with the scorch of fever. She finished the dance and all
                        others, taking Phil&apos;s numbers with Henderson, who had arrived too
                        late to arrange a programme. She left with the others, merely inclining her
                        head as she passed Ammon&apos;s father taking his place, and entered the
                        big touring car for which Henderson had telephoned.</p>
                    <p>She sank limply into a seat and moaned softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I drive awhile in the night air?&quot; asked Henderson.</p>
                    <p>She nodded. Henderson instructed the chauffeur.</p>
                    <p>She raised her head in a few seconds. &quot;Hart, I&apos;m going to
                        pieces,&quot; she said. &quot;Won&apos;t you put your arm around
                        me a little while?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-385" n="375"/>
                    <p>Henderson gathered her into his arms and her head fell on his shoulder.
                        &quot;Closer!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>Henderson gripped her with the strength of a practised athlete, and held her
                        until his arms were numb, but he did not know it. The tricks of fate are
                        cruel enough, but there scarcely could have been a worse one than that. To
                        care for a woman as he loved Edith Carr and have her given into his arms
                        because she was so numb with misery over her trouble with another man that
                        she did not know or care what she did. Dawn was streaking the east when he
                        spoke to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, it is growing light.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take me home,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Henderson helped her up the steps and rang the bell. When the door was opened
                        he went inside and guided her to her room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Carr is ill,&quot; he said to the footman. &quot;Rouse
                        her maid instantly, and have her prepare something hot as quickly as
                        possible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith,&quot; he cried, &quot;Just a word. I have been
                        thinking. It isn&apos;t too late yet. Take your ring and put it on. I
                        will go find Phil at once and tell him you have, that you are expecting him,
                        and he will come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Think what he said!&quot; she cried. &quot;He accepted my
                        decision as final, &apos;in the presence of witnesses,&apos; as if
                        it were court. He can return it to me, if I ever wear it again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think that now, but in a few days you will find that you feel
                        very differently. Living a life of heartache <pb id="VAA2373-386" n="376"/>
                        is no joke, and no job for a woman. Put on your ring and send me to tell him
                        to come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, there was not a soul who saw that, but sympathized with
                        Phil. It was ridiculous for you to get so angry over a thing which was never
                        intended for the slightest offence, and by no logical reasoning could have
                        been so considered.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think that?&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do!&quot; said Henderson. &quot;If you had laughed and
                        stepped aside an instant, or laughed and stayed where you were, Phil would
                        have been back; or, if he needed punishment in your eyes, to have found me
                        having one of his dances would have been enough. I was waiting. You could
                        have called me with one look. But to publicly do and say what you did, my
                        ladyI know Phil, and I know you went too far. Put on that ring, and send him
                        word you are sorry, before it is too late.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will not! He shall come to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then God help you!&quot; said Henderson, &quot;for you are
                        plunging into misery whose depth you do not dream. Edith, I beg of
                        you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She swayed where she stood. Her maid opened the door and caught her.
                        Henderson went down the hall and out to his car.</p>

                    <p>P<hi rend="sc">HILIP</hi> A<hi rend="sc">MMON</hi> walked from among his
                        friends a humiliated and a wounded man. Never before had Edith Carr appeared
                        quite so beautiful. All evening she had treated him with unusual
                        consideration. Never had he loved her so deeply. Then in a few seconds
                        everything was different. Seeing the change in her face, and hearing her
                        meaningless accusations, killed something in his heart. Warmth went out and
                        a cold weight took its place. But even after that, he had offered the ring
                        to her again, and asked her before others to reconsider. The answer had been
                        further insult.</p>
                    <p>He walked straight ahead, paying no heed to where he went. He had traversed
                        many miles when he became aware that his feet had chosen familiar streets.
                        He was passing his home. Dawn was near, but the first floor was lighted. He
                        staggered up the steps and was instantly admitted. The library door stood
                        open, while his father sat with a book pretending to read. At
                        Philip&apos;s entrance the father scarcely glanced up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on!&quot; he called. &quot;I have just told Banks to
                            <pb id="VAA2373-388" n="378"/> bring me a cup of coffee before I turn
                        in. Have one with me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip sat by the table and leaned his head on his hands, but he drank a cup
                        of steaming coffee and felt better.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father,&quot; he said, &quot;father, may I talk with you a
                        little while?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; answered Mr. Ammon. &quot;I am not at all
                        tired. I think I must have been waiting in the hope that you would come. I
                        want no one&apos;s version of this but yours. Tell me the straight of
                        the thing, Phil.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip told all he knew, while his father sat in deep thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;On my life I can&apos;t see any occasion for such a display of
                        temper, Phil. It passed all bounds of reason and breeding. Can&apos;t
                        you think of anything more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I cannot!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Polly says everyone expected you to carry the moth you caught to
                        Edith. Why didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She screams if a thing of that kind comes near her. She never has
                        taken the slightest interest in them. I was in a big hurry. I
                        didn&apos;t want to miss one minute of my dance with her. The moth was
                        not so uncommon, but by a combination of bad luck it had become the rarest
                        in America for a friend of mine, who is making a collection to pay college
                        expenses. For an instant last June the series was completed; when a
                        woman&apos;s uncontrolled temper ruined this specimen and the search for
                        it began over. A few days later a pair was secured, <pb id="VAA2373-389"
                            n="379"/> and again the money was in sight for several hours. Then an
                        accident wrecked one-fourth of the collection. I helped replace those last
                        June, all but this Yellow Emperor which we could not secure, and we
                        haven&apos;t been able to find, buy or trade for one since. So my friend
                        was compelled to teach this past winter instead of going to college. When
                        that moth came flying in there to-night, it seemed to me like fate. All I
                        thought of was, that to secure it would complete the collection and get the
                        money. So I caught the Emperor and started it to Elnora. I declare to you
                        that I was not out of the pavilion over three minutes at a liberal estimate.
                        If I only had thought to speak to the orchestra! I was sure I would be back
                        before enough couples gathered and formed for the dance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The eyes of the elder Ammon were very bright.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The friend for whom you wanted the moth is a girl?&quot; he
                        asked indifferently, as he ran the book leaves through his fingers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The girl of whom I wrote you last summer, and told you about in the
                        fall. I helped her all the time I was away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did Edith know of her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tried many times to tell her, to interest her, but she was so
                        indifferent that it was insulting. She would not hear me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are neither one in any condition to sleep. Why don&apos;t
                        you begin at the first and tell me about this girl? To think of other
                        matters for a time may clear our vision <pb id="VAA2373-390" n="380"/> for a
                        sane solution of this. Who is she, just what is she doing, and what is she
                        like? You know I was reared among those Limberlost people, I can understand
                        readily. What is her name and where does she live?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip gave a man&apos;s version of the previous summer, while his father
                        played with the book industriously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are very sure as to her refinement and education?&quot; he
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In almost two months&apos; daily association, could a man be
                        mistaken? She can far and away beat Polly, Edith, or any girl of our set on
                        any common, high school, or supplementary branch, and you know high schools
                        have French, German, and physics now. Besides, she is a graduate of two
                        other institutions. All her life she has been in the school of Hard Knocks.
                        She has the biggest, tenderest, most human heart I ever knew in a girl. She
                        has known life in its most cruel phases, and instead of hardening her, it
                        has set her trying to save other people suffering. Then this nature position
                        of which I told you; she graduated in the School of the Woods, before she
                        got that. The Bird Woman, whose work you know, helped her there. Elnora
                        knows more interesting things in a minute than any other girl I ever met
                        knew in an hour, provided you are a person who cares to understand plant and
                        animal life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The book leaves slid rapidly through his fingers as the father drawled,
                        &quot;What sort of looking girl is she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tall as Edith, a little heavier, pink, even complexion, wide open
                        blue-gray eyes with heavy black brows, and <pb id="VAA2373-391" n="381"/>
                        lashes so long they touch her cheeks. She has a rope of waving, shining hair
                        that makes a real crown on her head, and it appears almost red in the light.
                        She is as handsome as any fair woman I ever saw, but she doesn&apos;t
                        know it. Every time anyone pays her a compliment, her mother, who is a
                        caution, discovers that, for some reason, the girl is a fright, so she has
                        no appreciation of her looks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you were in daily association two months with a girl like that!
                        How about it, Phil?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you mean, did I trifle with her, no!&quot; cried Philip
                        hotly. &quot;I told her the second time I met her all about Edith.
                        Almost every day I wrote to Edith in her presence. Elnora gathered violets
                        and made a fancy basket to put them in for Edith&apos;s birthday. I
                        started to err in too open admiration for Elnora, but her mother brought me
                        up with a whirl I never forgot. Fifty times a day in the swamps and forests
                        Elnora made a perfect picture, but I neither looked nor said anything. I
                        never met any girl so downright noble in bearing and actions. I never hated
                        anything as I hated leaving her, for we were dear friends, like two wholly
                        congenial men. Her mother was almost always with us. She knew how much I
                        admired Elnora, but so long as I concealed it from the girl, the mother did
                        not care.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yet you left such a girl and came back whole-hearted to Edith
                        Carr!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Surely! You know how it has been with me about Edith all my
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-392" n="382"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yet the girl you picture is far her superior to an unprejudiced
                        person, when thinking what a man would require in a wife to be
                        happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never have thought what I would &apos;require&apos; to be
                        happy! I only thought whether I could make Edith happy. I have been an
                        idiot! What I&apos;ve borne you&apos;ll never know! To-night is only
                        one of many outbursts like that, in varying and lesser degrees.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Phil, I love you, when you say you have thought only of Edith! I
                        happen to know that it is true. You are my only son, and I have had a right
                        to watch you closely. I believe you utterly. Anyone who cares for you as I
                        do, and has had my years of experience in this world over yours, knows that
                        in some ways, tonight would be a blessed release, if you could take it; but
                        you cannot! Go to bed now, and get some rest. To-morrow, go back to her and
                        fix it up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You heard what I said when I left her! I said it because something
                        in my heart died a minute before that, and I realized that it was my love
                        for Edith Carr. Never again will I voluntarily face such a scene. If she can
                        act like that at a ball, before hundreds, over a thing of which I thought
                        nothing at all, she would go into actual physical fits and spasms, over some
                        of the household crises I&apos;ve seen the Mater meet with a smile. Sir,
                        it is truth that I have thought only of her up to the present. Now, I will
                        admit I am thinking about myself. Father, did you see her? Life is too
                        short, and it can be too sweet, to throw away in a battle with an <pb
                            id="VAA2373-393" n="383"/> unrestrained woman. I am no fighterwhere a
                        girl is concerned, anyway. I respect and love her or I do nothing. Never
                        again is either respect or love possible between me and Edith Carr. Whenever
                        I think of her in the future, I will see her as she was to-night. But I
                        can&apos;t face the crowd just yet. Could you spare me a few
                        days?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is only ten days until you were to go north for the summer, go
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I dont want to go north. I don&apos;t want to meet people I
                        know. There, the story would precede me. I do not need pitying glances or
                        rough condolences. I wonder if I could not hide at Uncle Ed&apos;s in
                        Wisconsin for awhile?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The book closed suddenly. The father leaned across the table and looked into
                        the son&apos;s eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Phil, are you sure of what you just have said?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quite sure!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think you are in any condition to decide to-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Death cannot return to life, father. My love for Edith Carr is
                        dead. I hope never to see her again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I thought you could be certain so soon! But, come to think of
                        it, you are very like me in many ways. I am with you in this. Public scenes
                        and disgraces I would not endure. It would be over with me, were I in your
                        position, that I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is done for all time,&quot; said Philip Ammon. &quot;Let
                        us not speak of it further.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then, Phil,&quot; the father leaned closer and looked <pb
                            id="VAA2373-394" n="384"/> at the son tenderly, &quot;Phil, why
                        don&apos;t you go to the Limberlost?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not? No one can comfort a hurt heart like a tender woman; and,
                        Phil, have you ever stopped to think that you may have a duty in the
                        Limberlost, if you are free? I don&apos;t know! I only suggest it. But,
                        for a country schoolgirl, unaccustomed to men, two months with a man like
                        you might well awaken feelings of which you do not think. Because you were
                        safeguarded is no sign the girl was. She might care to see you. You can soon
                        tell. With you, she comes next to Edith, and you have made it clear to me
                        that you appreciate her in many ways above. So I repeat it, why not go to
                        the Limberlost?&quot;</p>
                    <p>A long time Philip Ammon sat in deep thought. At last he raised his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, why not!&quot; he said. &quot;Years could make me no
                        surer than I am now, and life is short. Please ask Banks to get me some
                        coffee and toast, and I will bathe and dress so I can take the early
                        train.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go to your bath. I will attend to your packing and everything. And
                        Phil, if I were you, I would leave no addresses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not an address!&quot; said Ammon. &quot;Not even
                        Polly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When the train pulled out, the elder Ammon went home to find Hart Henderson
                        waiting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is Phil?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He did not feel like facing his friends at present, <pb
                            id="VAA2373-395" n="385"/> and I am just back from driving him to the
                        station. He said he might go to Siam, or Patagonia. He would leave no
                        address.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson almost staggered. &quot;He&apos;s not gone? And left no
                        address? You don&apos;t mean it! He&apos;ll never forgive
                        her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never is a long time, Hart,&quot; said Mr. Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And it seems even longer to those of us who are well acquainted
                        with Phil. Last night was not the last straw. It was the whole straw-stack.
                        It crushed Phil so far as she is concerned. He will not see her again
                        voluntarily, and he will not forget if he does. You can take it from him,
                        and from me, we have accepted the lady&apos;s decision. Will you have a
                        cup of coffee?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Twice Henderson opened his lips to speak of Edith Carr&apos;s despair.
                        Twice he looked into the stern, inflexible face of Mr. Ammon and could not
                        betray her. He held out the ring.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have no instructions as to that,&quot; said the elder Ammon,
                        drawing back. &quot;Possibly Miss Carr would have it as a
                        keepsake.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sure not,&quot; said Henderson curtly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then suppose you return it to Peacock. I will &apos;phone him.
                        He will give you the price of it, and you might add it to the
                        children&apos;s Fresh Air Fund. We would be obliged if you would do
                        that. No one here cares to handle the object.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As you choose,&quot; said Henderson. &quot;Good
                        morning!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he went to his home, but he could not think of <pb id="VAA2373-396"
                            n="386"/> sleep. He ordered breakfast, but he could not eat. He paced
                        the library for a time, but it was too small. Going out on the streets he
                        walked until exhausted, then he called a hansom and was driven to his club.
                        He had thought himself familiar with every depth of suffering; that night
                        had taught him that what he felt for himself was not to be compared with the
                        anguish which wrung his heart over the agony of Edith Carr. He tried to
                        blame Philip Ammon, but being an honest man, Henderson knew that was unjust.
                        The fault lay wholly with her, but that only made it harder for him, as he
                        realized it would in time for her. As he sauntered into the room an
                        attendant hurried to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are wanted most urgently at the &apos;phone, Mr.
                        Henderson,&quot; he said. &quot;You have had three calls from Main
                        5770.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson shivered as he picked down the receiver and gave the call.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that you, Hart?&quot; came Edith&apos;s voice.</p>
                    <p>Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you find Phil?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you try?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. As soon as I left you I went straight there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wasn&apos;t he home yet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He has been home and gone again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gone!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The cry tore Henderson&apos;s heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I come and tell you, Edith?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-397" n="387"/>
                    <p>&quot;No! Tell me now&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When I got to the house Banks said Mr. Ammon and Phil were out in
                        the motor, so I waited. Mr. Ammon came back soon. Edith, are you
                        alone?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Go on!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Call your maid. I can&apos;t tell you until someone is with
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me instantly!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, he said he had been to the station. He said Phil had started
                        to Siam or Patagonia, he didn&apos;t know which, and left no address. He
                        said&quot;</p>
                    <p>Distinctly Henderson heard her fall. He set the buzzer ringing, and in a few
                        seconds heard voices, so he knew she had been found. Then he crept into a
                        private den and shook with a hard, nervous chill.</p>
                    <p>The next day Edith Carr started on her trip to Europe. Henderson felt certain
                        she hoped to meet Philip there. He was sure she would be disappointed,
                        though he had no idea where Ammon could have gone. But after much thought he
                        decided he would see Edith soonest by remaining at home, so he spent the
                        summer in Chicago.</p>

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> must be thinking about supper, mother,&quot; said
                        Elnora, as she set the wings of a Cecropia with great care. &quot;It
                        seems as if I can&apos;t get enough to eat, or enough of being at home.
                        I enjoyed that city house. I don&apos;t believe I could have gotten
                        through my work if I had been compelled to walk back and forth. I thought at
                        first I never wanted to come here again. Now, I feel as if I could not live
                        anywhere else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock, &quot;there&apos;s
                        someone coming down the road.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Coming here, do you think?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, coming here, I suspect.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora glanced quickly at her mother and then turned to the road as Philip
                        Ammon reached the gate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Careful, mother!&quot; the girl instantly warned. &quot;If
                        you change your treatment of him a hair&apos;s breadth, he will suspect.
                        Come with me to meet him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She dropped her work and sprang up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, of all the delightful surprises!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>She was a trifle thinner than during the previous summer. On her face there
                        was a more mature, patient look, <pb id="VAA2373-399" n="389"/> but the sun
                        struck her bare head with the same ray of red gold. She wore one of the old
                        blue gingham dresses, open at the throat and rolled to the elbows. Mrs.
                        Comstock did not look at all the same woman, but Ammon saw only Elnora;
                        heard only her greeting. He caught both hands where she offered but one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora,&quot; he cried, &quot;if you were engaged to me,
                        and we were at a ball, among hundreds, where I offended you very much, and
                        didn&apos;t even know I had done anything, and if I asked you before all
                        of them to allow me to explain, to forgive me, to wait, would your face grow
                        distorted and unfamiliar with anger? Would you drop my ring on the floor and
                        insult me repeatedly? Oh, Elnora, would you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora&apos;s big eyes seemed to leap, while her face grew very white.
                        She wrenched away her hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hush, Phil! Hush!&quot; she protested. &quot;That fever has
                        you again! You are dreadfully ill. You don&apos;t know what you are
                        saying.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sleepless and exhausted; I&apos;m heartsick; but I am well
                        as I ever was. Answer me, Elnora, would you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Answer nothing!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock. If Wesley Sinton had
                        been speaking to her just then he would have called her
                        &quot;Kate.&quot; &quot;Answer nothing! Hang your coat there on
                        your nail, Phil, and come split some kindling. Elnora, clean away that
                        stuff, and set the table. Can&apos;t you see the boy is starved and
                        tired? He&apos;s come home to rest and get a decent meal. Come on,
                        Phil!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-400" n="390"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock marched away, and Ammon hung his coat in its old place and
                        followed. Out of sight and hearing she turned on him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you call yourself a man or a hound?&quot; she flared.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon!&quot; stammered Philip Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should think you would!&quot; she ejaculated.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll admit you did the square thing and was a man last
                        summer, though I&apos;d liked it better if you&apos;d faced up and
                        told me you were promised; but to come back here babying, and take hold of
                        Elnora like that, and talk that way because you have had a fuss with your
                        girl, I don&apos;t tolerate. Split that kindling and I&apos;ll get
                        your supper, and then you best go. I won&apos;t have you working on
                        Elnora&apos;s big heart, because you have quarreled with some one else.
                        You&apos;ll have it patched up in a week and be gone again, so you can
                        go right away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mrs. Comstock. I came here to ask Elnora to marry me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The more fool you, then!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This time yesterday you were engaged to another woman, no doubt.
                        Now, for some little flare-up you come racing here to use Elnora as a tool
                        to spite the other girl. A week of sane living, and you will be sorry and
                        ready to go back to Chicago, or, if you really are man enough to be sure of
                        yourself, she will come to claim you. She has her rights. An engagement of
                        years is a serious matter, and not broken for a whim. If you don&apos;t
                        go, she&apos;ll come. Then, when you patch up your affairs and go
                        sailing away together, where does my girl come in?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-401" n="391"/>
                    <p>&quot;I am a lawyer, Mrs. Comstock,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;It
                        appeals to me as beneath your ordinary sense of justice to decide a case
                        without hearing the evidence. It is due me that you hear me first.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hear your side!&quot; flashed Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;I&apos;d a heap sight rather hear the girl!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish to my soul that you had heard and seen her last night, Mrs.
                        Comstock,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;Then, my way would be clear. I
                        never even thought of coming here to-day. I&apos;ll admit I would have
                        come in time, but not for many months. My father sent me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your father sent you!&quot; repeated Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father, mother, and Polly were present last night. They, and all my
                        friends, saw me insulted and disgraced in the worst exhibition of
                        uncontrolled temper any of us ever witnessed. All of them knew it was the
                        end. Father liked what I had told him of Elnora, and he advised me to come
                        here, so I came. If she does not want me, I can leave instantly, but, oh, I
                        hoped she would understand!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You people are not splitting wood,&quot; called Elnora from the
                        back door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, we are!&quot; answered Mrs. Comstock. &quot;You
                        set out the things for biscuit, and lay the table.&quot; She turned
                        again to Ammon. &quot;I know considerable about your father,&quot;
                        she said. &quot;I have met your Uncle&apos;s family frequently this
                        winter. I&apos;ve heard your Aunt Anna say that she didn&apos;t at
                        all like Miss Carr, and <pb id="VAA2373-402" n="392"/> that she and all your
                        family secretly hoped that something would happen to prevent your marrying
                        her. That chimes right in with your saying that your father sent you here. I
                        guess you better speak your piece.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon gave his version of the previous night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you believe me?&quot; he finished.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;May I stay?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it looks all right for you, but what about her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing, so far as I am concerned. Her plans were all made to start
                        to Europe to-day. I suspect she is on the way by this time. Elnora is very
                        sensible, Mrs. Comstock. Hadn&apos;t you better let her decide
                        this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The final decision rests with her, of course,&quot; admitted
                        Mrs. Comstock. &quot;But look you one thing! She&apos;s all I have.
                        As Solomon says &apos;she is the one child, the only child of her
                        mother.&apos; I&apos;ve suffered enough in this world that I fight
                        against any suffering which threatens her. So far as I know you&apos;ve
                        always been a man, and you may stay. But if you bring tears and heartache to
                        her, don&apos;t have the assurance to think I&apos;ll bear it
                        tamely. I&apos;ll get right up and fight like a catamount, if things go
                        wrong for Elnora!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have no doubt but you will,&quot; replied Ammon,
                        &quot;and I don&apos;t blame you in the least if you do. I have the
                        utmost devotion to offer Elnora, a good home, fair social position, and my
                        family will love her dearly. Think it over. I know it is sudden, but my
                        father advised it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-403" n="393"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I reckon he did!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock dryly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess instead of me being the catamount, you had the genuine
                        article up in Chicago, masquerading in peacock feathers, and posing as a
                        fine lady, until her time came to scratch. Human nature seems to be pretty
                        much the same the world over. But I&apos;d give a pretty to know that
                        secret thing you say you don&apos;t, that set her to raving over your
                        just catching a moth for Elnora. You might get that crock of strawberries in
                        the spring house.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They prepared and ate supper. Afterward they sat in the arbour and talked, or
                        Elnora played until time for Ammon to go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you walk to the gate with me?&quot; he asked Elnora as he
                        arose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not to-night,&quot; she answered lightly. &quot;Come early
                        in the morning if you like, and we will go over to Sleepy Snake Creek and
                        hunt moths and gather dandelions for dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon leaned toward her. &quot;May I tell you tomorrow why I
                        came?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think not,&quot; replied Elnora. &quot;The fact is, I
                        don&apos;t care why you came. It is enough for me that we are your very
                        good friends, and that in trouble, you have found us a refuge. I fancy we
                        had better live a week or two before you say anything. There is a
                        possibility what you have to say may change in that length of
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It will not change one iota!&quot; cried Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then it will have the grace of that much age to give <pb
                            id="VAA2373-404" n="394"/> it some small touch of flavour,&quot;
                        said the girl. &quot;Come early in the morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She lifted the violin and began to play a dainty fairy dance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, bless my soul!&quot; softly ejaculated the astounded Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;To think I was worrying for fear you couldn&apos;t
                        take care of yourself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora laughed as she played.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I tell you what he said?&quot; inquired Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nope! I don&apos;t want to hear it!&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;He is only six hours from Chicago. I&apos;ll give her a week
                        to find him and fix it up, if he stays that long. If she don&apos;t put
                        in an appearance then, he can tell me what he wants to say, and
                        I&apos;ll take my time to think it over. Time in plenty, too! There are
                        three of us in this, and one has got to be left with a sore heart for life.
                        If the decision rests with me I propose to be very sure that it is the one
                        who deserves such hard luck. Let&apos;s go to bed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The next morning Ammon came early, dressed in the outing clothing he had worn
                        the previous summer, and aside from a slight paleness seemed very much the
                        same as when he left. Elnora met him on the old footing, and for a week life
                        went on exactly as it had the previous summer. Mrs. Comstock made mental
                        notes and watched in silence. She could see that Elnora was on a strain,
                        though she hoped Ammon would not. The girl grew restless as the week drew to
                        a close. Once <pb id="VAA2373-405" n="395"/> when the gate clicked she
                        suddenly lost colour and moved nervously. Billy came down the walk.</p>
                    <p>Ammon leaned toward Mrs. Comstock and said, &quot;I am expressly
                        forbidden to speak to Elnora as I would like just now. Would you mind
                        telling her for me that I had a letter from my father this morning saying
                        that Miss Carr is on her way to Europe for the summer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock promptly, &quot;I have
                        just heard that Carr woman is on her way to Europe, and I wish to my
                        gracious stars she&apos;d stay there!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip Ammon shouted, but Elnora arose hastily and went to meet Billy. They
                        came into the arbour together and after speaking to Mrs. Comstock and Ammon,
                        Billy said, &quot;Uncle Wesley and I found something funny, and we
                        thought you&apos;d like to see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what I should do without you and Uncle Wesley
                        to help me,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;What have you found
                        now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Something I couldn&apos;t bring. You have to come to it. I
                        tried to get one and I killed it. They are a kind of insecty things, and
                        they got a long tail that is three fine hairs. They stick those hairs right
                        into the hard bark of trees, and if you pull, the hairs stay fast and it
                        kills the bug.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will come at once,&quot; laughed Elnora. &quot;I know
                        what they are, and I can use some in my work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy, have you been crying?&quot; inquired Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-406" n="396"/>
                    <p>Billy lifted a chastened face. &quot;Yes, ma&apos;am,&quot; he
                        replied. &quot;This has been the worst day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with the day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The day is all right,&quot; admitted Billy. &quot;I mean
                        every single thing has gone wrong with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, that is too bad!&quot; sympathized Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;Tell me about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Began early this morning,&quot; said Billy. &quot;All
                        Snap&apos;s fault, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, what has poor Snap been doing?&quot; demanded Mrs.
                        Comstock, her eyes beginning to twinkle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Digging for woodchucks, just like he always does. He gets up at two
                        o&apos;clock to dig for them. He was coming in from the woods all tired
                        and covered thick with dirt. I was going to the barn with the pail of water
                        for Uncle Wesley to use in milking. I had to set down the pail to shut the
                        gate so the chickens wouldn&apos;t get into the flower beds, and old
                        Snap stuck his dirty nose into the water and began to lap it down. I knew
                        Uncle Wesley wouldn&apos;t use that, so I had to go &apos;way back
                        to the cistern for more, and it pumps awful hard. Made me mad, so I threw
                        the water on Snap.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing, if he&apos;d stood still. But it scared him awful, and
                        when he&apos;s afraid he just goes a-humping for Aunt Margaret. When he
                        got right up against her he stiffened out and gave a big shake. You oughter
                        seen the nice blue dress she had put on to go to Onabasha!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock and Ammon laughed, but Elnora put <pb id="VAA2373-407" n="397"
                        /> her arms around the boy. &quot;Oh, Billy!&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;That was too bad!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She got up early and ironed that dress to wear because it was cool.
                        Then, when it was all dirty, she wouldn&apos;t go, and she wanted to
                        real bad.&quot; Billy wiped his eyes. &quot;That ain&apos;t all,
                        either,&quot; he added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;d like to know about it, Billy,&quot; suggested
                        Mrs. Comstock, struggling with her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot; &apos;Cos she couldn&apos;t go to the city, she&apos;s
                        most worked herself to death, to-day. She&apos;s done all the dirty, old
                        hard jobs she could find. She&apos;s fixing her grape juice
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock. &quot;When a woman is
                        disappointed she always works like a dog to gain sympathy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Uncle Wesley and I are sympathizing all we know how, without
                        her working so. I&apos;ve squeezed until I almost busted to get the
                        juice out from the seeds and skins. That&apos;s the hard part. Now, she
                        has to strain it through white flannel and seal it in bottles, and
                        it&apos;s good for sick folks. Most wish I&apos;d get sick myself,
                        so I could have a glass. It&apos;s so good!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora glanced swiftly at her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I worked so hard,&quot; continued Billy, &quot;that she
                        said if I would throw the leavings in the woods, then I could come for you
                        to see about the bugs. Do you want to go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will all go,&quot; said Mrs. Comstock. &quot;I am
                        mightily interested in those bugs myself.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-408" n="398"/>
                    <p>From afar commotion could be seen at the Sinton home. Wesley and Margaret
                        were running around wildly and peculiar sounds filled the air.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the trouble?&quot; asked Ammon, hurrying to
                        Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cholera!&quot; groaned Sinton. &quot;My hogs are dying like
                        flies.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret was softly crying. &quot;Wesley, can&apos;t I fix something
                        hot? Can&apos;t we do anything? It means several hundred dollars and our
                        winter meat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never saw stock taken so suddenly and so hard,&quot; said
                        Wesley. &quot;I have &apos;phoned for the veterinary to come as soon
                        as he can get here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>All of them hurried to the feeding pen into which the pigs seemed to be
                        gathering from the woods. Among the common stock were big white beasts of
                        pedigree which were Wesley&apos;s pride at county fairs. Several of
                        these rolled on their backs, pawing the air feebly and emitting little
                        squeaks. A huge Berkshire sat on his haunches, slowly shaking his head, the
                        water dropping from his eyes, until he, too, rolled over with faint grunts.
                        A pair crossing the yard on wavering legs collided, and attacked each other
                        in anger, only to fall, so weak they scarcely could squeal. A fine snowy
                        Plymouth Rock rooster after several attempts, flew to the fence, balanced
                        with great effort, wildly flapped his wings and started to emit a guttural
                        crow, but broke off and fell sprawling among the pigs, too helpless to
                        stand.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-409" n="399"/>
                    <p>&quot;Did you ever see such a dreadful sight?&quot; sobbed Margaret.</p>
                    <p>Billy climbed on the fence, took one long look and turned an astounded face
                        to Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why them pigs is drunk!&quot; he cried. &quot;They act just
                        like my pa!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wesley turned on Margaret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did you put the leavings from that grape juice?&quot; he
                        demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I sent Billy to throw it in the woods.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy&quot; began Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Threw it just where she told me to,&quot; cried Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But some of the pigs came by there coming into the pen, and some
                        were close in the fence corners.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did they eat it?&quot; demanded Wesley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They just chanked into it,&quot; replied Billy graphically.
                        &quot;They pushed, and squealed, and fought over it. You
                        couldn&apos;t blame &apos;em! It was the best stuff I ever
                        tasted!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Faint squealing, punctuated by feeble crows filled the long pause which
                        ensued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Margaret,&quot; said Wesley, &quot;run, &apos;phone
                        that doctor he won&apos;t be needed. Billy, take Elnora and Mr. Ammon to
                        see the bugs. Katharine, suppose you help me a little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley took the clothes basket from the back porch and started in the
                        direction of the cellar. Margaret returned from the telephone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I just caught him,&quot; she said. &quot;There&apos;s
                        that much saved. Why, Wesley, what are you going to do?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-410" n="400"/>
                    <p>&quot;You go sit on the front porch a little while,&quot; said
                        Wesley. &quot;You will feel better if you don&apos;t see
                        this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wesley,&quot; cried Margaret aghast. &quot;Some of that
                        wine is ten years old. There&apos;s days and days of hard work in it,
                        and I couldn&apos;t say how much sugar. Dr. Ammon keeps people alive
                        with it when nothing else will stay on their stomachs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let &apos;em die, then!&quot; said Wesley. &quot;You
                        heard the boy, didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a cold process. There&apos;s not a particle of
                        fermentation about it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a particle of fermentation! Great day, Margaret! Look at those
                        pigs!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Margaret took a long look. &quot;Leave me a few bottles for
                        mince-meat,&quot; she wavered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a smell for any cause on this earth! You heard the boy, He
                        shan&apos;t say, when he grows to manhood that he learned to like it
                        here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wesley made a clean sweep, Mrs. Comstock cheerfully assisting. Then they all
                        went to the woods to see and learn about the wonderful insects. The day
                        ended with a big supper at Sintons&apos;, and then they went down to the
                        Comstock cabin for a concert. Elnora played beautifully that night. When the
                        Sintons left she kissed Billy with particular tenderness. She was so moved
                        that she was kinder to Ammon than she had intended to be, and Elnora as an
                        antidote to a disappointed lover, was a decided success in any mood.</p>
                    <p>However strong the attractions of Edith Carr had <pb id="VAA2373-411" n="401"
                        /> been, once the bond was finally broken, Philip Ammon could not help
                        realizing that Elnora was the superior woman, and that he was fortunate to
                        have escaped, just when he regarded his ties strongest. Every day, while
                        working with Elnora, he saw more to admire. He grew very thankful that he
                        was free to try to win her, and impatient to justify himself to her.</p>
                    <p>Elnora did not evince the slightest haste to hear what he had to say, but
                        waited the week she had set, in spite of Philip&apos;s hourly manifest
                        impatience. When she did consent to listen, Philip realized before he had
                        talked five minutes, that she was putting herself in Edith Carr&apos;s
                        place, and judging him from what the other girl&apos;s standpoint would
                        be. That was so disconcerting, he did not plead his cause nearly so well as
                        he had hoped, for when he ceased Elnora sat in silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are my judge,&quot; he said at last. &quot;What is your
                        verdict?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I could hear her speak from her heart as I just have heard you,
                        then I could decide,&quot; answered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is on the ocean,&quot; said Philip. &quot;She went
                        because she knew she was wholly in the wrong. She had nothing to say, or she
                        would have remained.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That sounds plausible,&quot; reasoned Elnora, &quot;but it
                        is pretty hard to find a woman in an affair that involves her heart, with
                        nothing at all to say. I fancy if I could meet her just now she would say
                        several things. I should love to hear them. If I could <pb id="VAA2373-412"
                            n="402"/> talk with her three minutes, I could tell what answer to make
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you believe me, Elnora?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Unquestioningly,&quot; answered Elnora. &quot;But I would
                        believe her also. If only I could meet her I soon would know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see how that is to be accomplished,&quot; said
                        Ammon, &quot;but I am perfectly willing. There is no reason why you
                        should not meet her, except that she probably would lose her temper and
                        insult you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not to any extent,&quot; said Elnora calmly. &quot;I have a
                        tongue of my own, while I am not without some small sense of personal
                        values.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon glanced into her face and began to laugh. Very different of facial
                        formation and colouring, Elnora at times, closely resembled her mother. She
                        joined in Ammon&apos;s laugh a little ruefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The point is this,&quot; she said. &quot;Someone is going
                        to get hurt, most dreadfully. If the decision as to who it shall be rests
                        with me, I must know it is the right one. Of course, no one ever hinted it
                        to you, but you are a very attractive man, Philip. You are mighty good to
                        look at, and you have a trained, refined mind, that makes you most
                        interesting. For years Edith Carr has felt that you were hers. She has lived
                        expecting to assume the closest relations of life with you. She has thought
                        of you as hers, and you were hers. Now, how is she going to change? I have
                        been thinkingthinking deep and long, Phil. If I were in her place, I simply
                        could not <pb id="VAA2373-413" n="403"/> give you up, unless you had made
                        yourself unworthy of love. Undoubtedly, you never seemed so desirable to her
                        as just now, when she is told she can&apos;t have you. What I think is
                        that she will come to claim you yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You overlook the fact that it is not in a woman&apos;s power to
                        throw away a man and pick him up at leisure,&quot; said Ammon with some
                        warmth. &quot;She publicly and repeatedly cast me off. I accepted her
                        decision as publicly as it was made. You have done all your thinking from a
                        wrong viewpoint. You seem to have an idea that it lies with you to decide
                        what I shall do, that if you say the word, I shall return to Edith. Get that
                        thought out of your head! Now, and for all time to come, she is a matter of
                        indifference to me. She killed all feeling in my heart for her so
                        completely, that I do not even dread meeting her. I could see her coming
                        down the walk now without the quickening of a heartbeat. I can meet her as
                        casually as any woman I ever met, and liked least of all women.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I hated her, or was angry with her, I could not be sure the
                        feeling would not die. As it is, she has deadened me into a creature of
                        indifference. So you just revise your viewpoint a little, Elnora. Cease
                        thinking it is for you to decide what I shall do, and that I will obey you.
                        I make my own decisions in reference to any woman, save you. The question
                        you are to decide is whether I may remain here, associating with you as I
                        did last summer; but with the difference that it is understood that I am
                        free; that it is my intention to care for <pb id="VAA2373-414" n="404"/> you
                        all I please, to make you return my feeling for you if I can. There is just
                        one question for you to decide, and it is not triangular. It is between us.
                        May I remain? May I love you? Will you give me the chance to prove what I
                        think of you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You speak very plainly,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is the time to speak plainly,&quot; said Philip Ammon.
                        &quot;There is no use in allowing you to go on threshing out a problem
                        which does not exist. If you do not want me here, say so and I will go. Of
                        course, I warn you before I start, that I will come back. I won&apos;t
                        yield without the stiffest fight it is in me to make. I will have all you
                        have to give any man if I can get it. But drop thinking it lies in your
                        power to send me back to Edith Carr. If she were the last woman in the
                        world, and I the last man, I&apos;d jump off the planet before I would
                        give her further opportunity to exercise her temper on me. Narrow this to
                        us, Elnora. Will you take the place she vacated? Will you take the heart she
                        threw away? I &apos;d give my right hand and not flinch, if I could
                        offer you my life, free from any contact with hers, but that is not
                        possible. I can&apos;t undo things which are done. I can only profit by
                        experience and build better in the future.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see how you can be sure of yourself,&quot;
                        said Elnora. &quot;I don&apos;t see how I could be sure of you. You
                        loved her first, you never can care for me anything like that. Always
                        I&apos;d have to be afraid you were thinking of her and
                        regretting.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-415" n="405"/>
                    <p>&quot;Folly!&quot; cried Ammon. &quot;Regretting what? That I was
                        not married to a woman who was liable to rave at me any time or place,
                        without my being conscious of having given offence? A man does relish that!
                        I am likely to pine for more!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d be thinking she&apos;d learned a lesson. You
                        would think it wouldn&apos;t happen again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I wouldn&apos;t be &quot;thinking,&apos; &quot;
                        said Ammon. I&apos;d be everlastingly sure! I wouldn&apos;t risk
                        what I went through that night again, not to save my life! Just you and me,
                        Elnora. Decide for us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;I am
                        afraid!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;We will wait until you
                        feel that you can. Wait until fear vanishes. Just decide now whether you
                        would rather have me go for a few months, or remain with you. Which shall it
                        be, Elnora?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can never love me as you did her,&quot; wailed Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am happy to say I cannot,&quot; replied Ammon.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve cut my matrimonial teeth. I&apos;m cured of
                        wanting to swell in society. I&apos;ve gotten over being proud of a
                        woman for her looks alone. I have no further use for lavishing myself on a
                        beautiful, elegantly dressed creature, who thinks only of self. I have come
                        to the surface. I have learned that I am just a common man. I admire beauty
                        and beautiful clothing just as much as I ever did; but, first, I want an
                        understanding, deep as the lowest recess of my soul, with the woman I marry.
                        I <pb id="VAA2373-416" n="406"/> want to work for you, to plan for you, to
                        build you a home with every comfort, to give you all good things I can, to
                        shield you from every evil. I want to interpose my body between yours and
                        fire, flood, or famine. I want to give you everything; but I hate the idea
                        of getting nothing at all on which I can depend in return. Edith Carr had
                        only good looks to offer, and when anger overtook her, beauty went out like
                        a snuffed candle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to love me. I want some consideration. I even crave
                        respect. I&apos;ve kept myself clean. So far as I know how to be, I am
                        honest and scrupulous. It wouldn&apos;t hurt me to feel that you took
                        some interest in these things. Pretty fierce temptations strike a man, every
                        few days, in this world. I can keep decent, for a woman who cares for
                        decency, but when I do, I&apos;d like to have the fact recognized, by
                        just enough of a show of appreciation that I could see it. I am tired of
                        this one-sided business. It has made me selfish. After this, I want to get a
                        little in return for what I give. Elnora, you have love, tenderness, and
                        honest appreciation of the finest in life. Take what I offer, and give what
                        I ask.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do not ask much,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As for not loving you as I did Edith,&quot; continued Ammon,
                        &quot; as I said before, I hope not! I have a newer and a better idea of
                        loving. The feeling I offer you was inspired by you. It is a Limberlost
                        product. It is as much bigger, cleaner, and more wholesome than any feeling
                        I ever had for Edith Carr, as you are bigger than she, <pb id="VAA2373-417"
                            n="407"/> when you stand before your classes and in calm dignity explain
                        the marvels of the Almighty, while she stands on a ballroom floor, and gives
                        way to uncontrolled temper. Ye gods, Elnora, if you could look into my soul,
                        you would see it leap and rejoice over my escape! Perhaps it isn&apos;t
                        decent, but it&apos;s human, and I&apos;m only a common human being.
                        I&apos;m the gladdest thing alive that I&apos;m free! I would turn
                        somersaults and yell if I dared. What an escape! Just snatched out of it
                        with a clean conscience, when I was most besotted. Stop straining after
                        Edith Carr&apos;s viewpoint and take a look from mine. Put yourself in
                        my place and try to study out how I feel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am so happy I get religious over it. Fifty times a day I catch
                        myself whispering, &quot;My soul is escaped!&apos; As for you, take
                        all the time you want. If you had rather be alone, I&apos;ll take the
                        next train and stay away as long as I can bear it, but I&apos;ll come
                        back. You can be most sure of that. Straight as your pigeons to their loft,
                        I&apos;ll come back to you, Elnora. Shall I go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, what&apos;s the use to be extravagant?&quot; murmured
                        Elnora.</p>

                        previous June. There were long moth hunts, days of specimen gathering,
                        wonderful hours with great books, big dinners all of them helped to prepare,
                        and perfect nights filled with music. Everything was as it had been, with
                        the difference that Philip was now an avowed suitor. He missed no
                        opportunity to advance himself in Elnora&apos;s graces. At the end of
                        the month he was no nearer any sort of understanding with her than he had
                        been at the beginning. He revelled in the privilege of loving her, but he
                        got no response. Elnora believed in his love, yet she hesitated to accept
                        him, because she could not forget Edith Carr.</p>
                    <p>One afternoon early in July, Ammon came across the fields, through the
                        Comstock woods, and entered the garden. He inquired for Elnora at the back
                        door and was told that she was reading under the willow. He went around the
                        west end of the cabin to her. She sat on a rustic bench they had made and
                        placed beneath a drooping branch. Ammon had not seen her before in <pb
                            id="VAA2373-419" n="409"/> the dress she was wearing. It was clinging
                        mull of pale green, trimmed with narrow ruffles and touched with knots of
                        black velvet; a simple dress, but vastly becoming. Every tint of her bright
                        hair, her luminous eyes, her red lips, and her rose-flushed face, neck, and
                        arms grew a little more vivid with the delicate green setting.</p>
                    <p>Ammon stopped short. She was so near, so temptingly sweet, he lost control.
                        He went to her with a half-smothered cry after that first long look, dropped
                        on one knee beside her and reached an arm behind her to the bench back, so
                        that he was very near. He caught her hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora!&quot; he cried tensely, &quot;end it now! Say this
                        strain is over. I pledge you that you will be happy. You don&apos;t
                        know! If you only would say the word, you would awake to new life and great
                        joy! Won&apos;t you promise me now, Elnora?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The girl sat staring into the west woods, while strong in her eyes was her
                        father&apos;s look of seeing something invisible to others.
                        Ammon&apos;s arm slipped from the bench around her. His fingers closed
                        firmly over hers, his face came very near.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora,&quot; he pleaded, &quot;you know me well enough.
                        You have had time in plenty. End it now. Say you will be mine!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He gathered her closer, pressing his face against hers, his breath on her
                        cheek.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t you quite promise yet, my girl of the
                        Limberlost?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-420" n="410"/>
                    <p>Elnora shook her head. Instantly he released her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he begged. &quot;I had no intention of
                        thrusting myself upon you, but, Elnora, you are the veriest Queen of Love,
                        this afternoon. From the tips of your toes to your shining crown, I worship
                        you. All my life I will. I want no woman save you. You are so wonderful this
                        afternoon, I couldn&apos;t help urging. Forgive me. Perhaps it was
                        something that came this morning for you. I wrote Polly to send it. May we
                        just try if it fits? Will you tell me if you like it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He drew a little white velvet box from his pocket and showed her a splendid
                        emerald ring.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It may not be right,&quot; he said. &quot;The inside of a
                        glove finger is not very accurate for a measure, but it was the best I could
                        do. I wrote Polly to get it, because she and mother are home from the East
                        this week, but next they will go on to our cottage in the north, and no one
                        knows what is right quite so well as Polly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laid the ring in Elnora&apos;s hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dearest,&quot; he said, &quot;don&apos;t slip that on
                        your finger; put your arms around my neck and promise me, all at once and
                        abruptly, or I&apos;ll keel over and die of sheer joy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t! Not all those venturesome things at once; but,
                        Phil, I&apos;m ashamed to confess that ring simply fascinates me. It is
                        the most beautiful one I ever saw, and do you know that I never owned a ring
                        of any kind in my life? Would you think me unwomanly if I slip it on just a
                        second, before I can say for sure. Phil, you <pb id="VAA2373-421" n="411"/>
                        know I care! I care very much! You know I will tell you the instant I feel
                        right about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly you will,&quot; agreed Ammon promptly. &quot;It
                        is your right to take all the time you choose. I can&apos;t put that
                        ring on you until it means a bond between us. I&apos;ll shut my eyes and
                        you try it on, so we can see if it fits and looks well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip turned his face toward the west woods and tightly closed his eyes. It
                        was a boyish thing to do, and it caught the hesitating girl in the depths of
                        her heart as the boy element in a man ever appeals to a motherly woman.
                        Before she quite realized what she was doing, the ring slid on her finger.
                        With both arms she caught Ammon and drew him to her breast, holding him
                        closely. Her head drooped over his, her lips were on his hair. So an
                        instant, then her arms dropped. Ammon lifted a convulsed, white face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dear Lord!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Youyou didn&apos;t
                        mean that, Elnora! YouWhat made you do it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Youyou looked so boyish!&quot; panted Elnora. &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t mean it! II forgot that you were older than Billy. Looklook
                        at the ring!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She thrust her hand before him to distract his attention.</p>
                    <p>&quot; &quot;The Queen can do no wrong,&apos; &quot; quoted
                        Ammon between his set teeth. &quot;But don&apos;t you do that again,
                        Elnora, unless you do mean it. Kings are not so good as queens, and there is
                        a limit with all men. As you say, we will look at your ring. It seems very
                        lovely to me. <pb id="VAA2373-422" n="412"/> Suppose you leave it on until
                        time for me to go. Please do! I have heard of mute appeals; perhaps it will
                        plead for me. I am wild for your lips this afternoon. I am going to take
                        your hands.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He caught both of them and covered them with kisses. He lifted his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Elnora,&quot; he said, &quot;will you be my wife?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must have a little more time,&quot; she whispered.
                        &quot;I must be absolutely certain, for when I say yes, and give myself
                        to you, only death shall part us. I would not give you up. So I want just a
                        little more timebut, I think I will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;If at any time you feel
                        that you have reached a decision, will you tell me? I don&apos;t feel as
                        if I could lose a second waiting to stumble on that fact. Will you promise
                        me to tell me instantly, or shall I keep asking you until the time
                        comes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You make it difficult,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;But I will
                        promise you that. Whenever the last doubt vanishes, I will let you know
                        instantlyif I can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would it be hard for you?&quot; whispered Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;II don&apos;t know,&quot; faltered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems as if I can&apos;t be man enough to put this thought
                        aside and give up this afternoon,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I am
                        ashamed of myself, but I can&apos;t help it. I am going to ask God to
                        make that last doubt vanish before I go this night. I am going to believe
                        that ring will plead for me. I am going to hope that doubt will disappear
                        suddenly. I will be watching. Every second I will <pb id="VAA2373-423"
                            n="413"/> be watching. If it happens and you can&apos;t speak, give
                        me your hand. Just the least movement toward me, I will understand. Would it
                        help you to talk it over with your mother? Shall I call her? Shall
                        I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Honk! Honk! Honk! Hart Henderson set the alarm of the big automobile going as
                        it shot from behind the trees lining the Brushwood road. The picture of a
                        vine-covered cabin, a great drooping tree, a green-clad girl, and a man
                        bending over her very closely flashed into view. Edith Carr caught her
                        breath with a snap. Polly Ammon gave Tom Levering a quick touch and wickedly
                        winked at him.</p>
                    <p>Several days before, Edith had returned from Europe suddenly. She and
                        Henderson had called at the Ammon residence saying that they were going to
                        motor down to the Limberlost to see Philip a few hours, and urged that Polly
                        and Tom accompany them. Mrs. Ammon knew that her husband would disapprove of
                        the trip, but it was easy to see that Edith Carr had determined on going. So
                        the mother thought it better to have Polly along to support Philip than to
                        allow him to confront Edith unexpectedly and alone. Polly was full of
                        spirit. She did not relish the thought of Edith as a sister. Always they had
                        been in the same set, always Edith, because of greater beauty and wealth,
                        had patronized Polly. Although it had rankled, she had borne it sweetly. But
                        two days before, her father had extracted a promise of secrecy, given her
                        Philip&apos;s address and told her to send him the finest emerald ring
                        she could select. Polly <pb id="VAA2373-424" n="414"/> knew how that ring
                        would be used. What she did not know was that the girl who accompanied her
                        went back to the store afterward, made an excuse to the clerk that she had
                        been sent to be absolutely sure that the address was right, and so secured
                        it for Edith Carr.</p>
                    <p>Two days later Edith had induced Hart Henderson to take her to Onabasha. By
                        the aid of maps they located the Comstock land and passed it, merely to see
                        the place. Henderson hated that trip, and implored Edith not to take it, but
                        she made no effort to conceal from him what she suffered, and it was more
                        than he could endure. He pointed out that Philip had gone away without
                        leaving an address, because he did not wish to see her, or any of them. But
                        Edith was so sure of her power, she felt certain Philip needed only to see
                        her to succumb to her beauty as he always had done, while now she was ready
                        to plead for forgiveness. So they came down the Brushwood road, and
                        Henderson had just said to Edith beside him, &quot;This should be the
                        Comstock land on our left.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A minute later the wood ended, while the sunlight, as always pitiless, etched
                        with distinctness the scene at the west end of the cabin. Instinctively, to
                        save Edith, Henderson set the whistle blowing. He had thought to go on to
                        the city, but Polly Ammon stood, crying, &quot;Phil! Phil!&quot; Tom
                        Levering was on his feet shouting and waving, while Edith in her most
                        imperial manner ordered him to turn into the lane leading through the woods
                        beside the cabin.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-425" n="415"/>
                    <p>&quot;Fix it some way that I get a minute alone with her,&quot; she
                        commanded as he stopped the car.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is my sister Polly, her fianc Tom Levering, a friend of mine
                        named Henderson, and&quot; began Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;and Edith Carr,&quot; volunteered Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And Edith Carr,&quot; repeated Philip Ammon. &quot;Elnora,
                        be brave, for my sake. Their coming can make no difference in any way. I
                        won&apos;t let them stay but a few minutes. Come with me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do I look scared?&quot; inquired Elnora serenely.
                        &quot;This is why you haven&apos;t had your answer. I have been
                        waiting just six weeks for that motor. You may bring them to me at the
                        arbour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ammon glanced at her and broke into a laugh. She had not lost colour. Her
                        self-possession was perfect. She deliberately turned and walked toward the
                        grape arbour, while he sprang over the west fence and ran to the car.</p>
                    <p>Elnora standing in the arbour entrance made a perfect picture, framed in
                        green leaves and tendrils. No matter how her heart ached, it was good to
                        her, for it pumped steadily, and kept her cheeks and lips suffused with
                        colour. She saw Philip reach the car and gather his sister into his arms.
                        Past her he reached a hand to Levering, then to Edith Carr and Henderson. He
                        lifted his sister to the ground, and assisted Edith to alight. Instantly,
                        she stepped beside him, and Elnora&apos;s heart played its first trick.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-426" n="416"/>
                    <p>She could see that Miss Carr was splendidly beautiful, while she moved with
                        the hauteur and grace supposed to be the prerogatives of royalty. And she
                        had instantly taken possession of Philip Ammon. But Ammon also had a brain
                        which was working with rapidity. He knew Elnora was watching so he swung
                        around to the others.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give her up, Tom!&quot; he cried. &quot;I didn&apos;t
                        know I wanted to see the little nuisance so badly, but I do. How are father
                        and mother? Polly, didn&apos;t the mater send me something?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She did!&quot; said Polly Ammon, stopping on the path and
                        lifting her chin as a little child, while she drew away her veil.</p>
                    <p>Philip caught her in his arms and stooped for his mother&apos;s kiss.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be good to Elnora!&quot; he whispered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Umhu!&quot; assented Polly. And aloud&quot;Look at that
                        ripping green and gold symphony! I never saw such a beauty! Thomas Asquith
                        Levering, you come straight here and take my hand!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Edith&apos;s move to compel Ammon to approach Elnora beside her had been
                        easy to see; also its failure. Henderson stepped into Ammon&apos;s place
                        as he turned to his sister. Instead of taking Polly&apos;s hand Levering
                        ran to open the gate. Edith passed through first, but Polly darted in front
                        of her on the run, with Phil holding her arm, and swept up to Elnora. Polly
                        looked for the ring and saw it. That settled matters with her.</p>

                        <p rend="center">&quot;With her lips near Elnora&apos;s car Polly
                            whispered, &quot;Sister! Dear, dear sister!&apos; &quot;</p>
                    </figure>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-428" n="417"/>
                    <p>&quot;You lovely, lovely, darling girl!&quot; she cried, throwing her
                        arms around Elnora and kissing her. With her lips near Elnora&apos;s
                        ear, Polly whispered, &quot;Sister! Dear, dear sister!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora drew back, staring at Polly in confused amazement. She was a beautiful
                        girl, dressed in some wonderful way, her eyes were sparkling and dancing,
                        and as she turned to make way for the others, she kept one of
                        Elnora&apos;s hands in hers. Polly would have dropped very dead in that
                        instant if Edith Carr could have killed with a look, for not until then did
                        she realize that Polly would even many a slight, and that it had been a
                        great mistake to bring her.</p>
                    <p>Edith bowed low, muttered something and touched Elnora&apos;s fingers.
                        Tom Levering took his cue from Polly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I always follow a good example,&quot; he said, and before
                        anyone could divine his intention he kissed Elnora as he gripped her hand
                        and cried, &quot;Mighty glad to meet you! Like to meet you a dozen times
                        a day, you know!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora laughed and her heart pumped smoothly. They had accomplished their
                        purpose. They had let her know they were there through compulsion, but on
                        her side. In that instant only pity was in Elnora&apos;s breast for the
                        flashing dark beauty, standing with smiling face while her heart must have
                        been filled with exceeding bitterness. Elnora stepped back from the
                        entrance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come into the shade,&quot; she urged. &quot;You must have
                        found it warm on these country roads. Won&apos;t you lay <pb
                            id="VAA2373-429" n="418"/> aside your dust-coats and have a cool drink?
                        Philip, would you ask mother to come, and bring that pitcher in the spring
                        house?&quot;</p>
                    <p>They entered the arbour exclaiming at the dim, green coolness. There was
                        plenty of room and wide seats around the sides, a table in the centre, on
                        which lay a piece of embroidery, magazines, books, the moth apparatus, and
                        the cyanide jar containing several specimens. Polly rejoiced in the cooling
                        shade, slipped off her duster, removed her hat, rumpled her pretty hair and
                        seated herself to indulge in the delightful occupation of paying off old
                        scores. Tom Levering followed her example. Edith took a seat, but refused to
                        remove her hat and coat, while Henderson stood in the entrance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There goes something with wings! Should you have that?&quot;
                        cried Levering.</p>
                    <p>He seized a net from the table and raced across the garden after a butterfly.
                        He caught it and came back mightily pleased with himself. As the creature
                        struggled in the net, Elnora noted a repulsed look on Edith Carr&apos;s
                        face. Levering helped the situation beautifully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now what have I got?&quot; he demanded. &quot;Is it just a
                        common one that everyone knows and you don&apos;t keep, or is it the
                        rarest bird off the perch?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must have had practice, you took that so perfectly,&quot;
                        said Elnora. &quot;I am sorry, but it is quite common and not of a kind
                        I keep. Suppose all of you see how beautiful it is and then it may go nectar
                        hunting again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She held the butterfly where all of them could see, <pb id="VAA2373-430"
                            n="419"/> showed its upper and under wing colours, answered
                        Polly&apos;s questions as to what it ate, how long it lived, and how it
                        died. Then she put it into Polly&apos;s hand saying, &quot;Stand
                        there in the light and loosen your hold slowly and easily.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora caught a brush from the table and began softly stroking the
                        creature&apos;s sides and wings. Delighted with the sensation the
                        butterfly slowly opened and closed its wings, clinging to Polly&apos;s
                        soft little fingers, while everyone cried out in surprise. Elnora laid aside
                        the brush, and the butterfly sailed away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, you are a wizard! You charm them!&quot; marvelled
                        Levering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I learned that from the Bird Woman,&quot; said Elnora.
                        &quot;She takes soft brushes and coaxes butterflies and moths into the
                        positions she wants for the illustrations of a book she is writing. I have
                        helped her often. Most of the rare ones I get go to her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you don&apos;t keep all you take?&quot; questioned
                        Levering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, dear, no!&quot; cried Elnora. &quot;Not a tenth! For
                        myself, a pair of each kind to use in illustrating the lectures I give in
                        the city schools in the winter, and one pair for each collection I make. One
                        might just as well keep the big night moths of June, for they only live four
                        or five days anyway. For the Bird Woman, I only save rare ones she has not
                        yet secured. Sometimes I think it is cruel to take such creatures from
                        freedom, even for an hour, but it is the only way to teach the masses <pb
                            id="VAA2373-431" n="420"/> of people how to distinguish the pests they
                        should destroy, from the harmless ones of great beauty, and secure
                        propagation privileges for them. Here comes mother with something cool to
                        drink.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock came deliberately, talking to Ammon as she approached. Elnora
                        gave her one searching look, but could discover only an extreme brightness
                        of eye to denote any unusual feeling. She wore one of her lavender dresses,
                        while her snowy hair was high piled. She had taken care of her complexion,
                        and her face had grown fuller during the winter. She might have been
                        anyone&apos;s mother with pride, and she was perfectly at ease.</p>
                    <p>Polly instantly went to her and held up her face to be kissed. Mrs.
                        Comstock&apos;s eyes twinkled and she made the greeting hearty.</p>
                    <p>The drink was compounded of the juices of oranges and berries from the
                        garden. It was cool enough to frost glasses and pitcher and delicious to
                        dusty tired travellers. Soon the pitcher was empty, and Elnora picked it up
                        and went to refill it. While she was gone Henderson asked Philip about some
                        trouble he was having with his car. They went to the woods and began a
                        minute examination to find a defect which did not exist. Polly and Levering
                        were having an animated conversation with Mrs. Comstock. Henderson saw Edith
                        arise, follow the garden path next the woods and stand waiting under the
                        willow which Elnora would pass on her return. It was for that meeting he had
                        made the trip. He got down on the ground, tore up the car, <pb
                            id="VAA2373-432" n="421"/> worked, asked for help, and kept Philip busy
                        screwing bolts and applying the oil can. All the time Henderson kept an eye
                        on Edith and Elnora under the willow. But he took pains to lay the work he
                        asked Philip to do where that scene would be out of his sight. When Elnora
                        came around the corner with the pitcher, she found herself facing Edith
                        Carr.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want a minute with you,&quot; said Miss Carr.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Elnora, walking on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Set the pitcher on the bench there,&quot; commanded Edith Carr,
                        as if speaking to a servant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I prefer not to offer my guests a warm drink,&quot; said
                        Elnora. &quot;I&apos;ll come back if you really wish to speak with
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came solely for that,&quot; said Edith Carr.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It would be a pity to travel so far in this dust and heat for
                        nothing. I&apos;ll only be gone a second.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora set the pitcher before her mother. &quot;Please serve
                        this,&quot; she said. &quot;Miss Carr wishes to speak with
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, don&apos;t you pay the least attention to anything she
                        says,&quot; cried Polly. &quot;Tom and I didn&apos;t come here
                        because we wanted to. We just came to checkmate her. I hoped I&apos;d
                        get the opportunity to say a word to you, and now she has given it to me. I
                        just want to tell you that she threw Phil over in perfectly horrid style.
                        All of us detest her for it, as much as he does. She hasn&apos;t any
                        right to lay the ghost of a claim to him, has she, Tom?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nary a claim,&quot; said Tom Levering earnestly. &quot;Why,
                            <pb id="VAA2373-433" n="422"/> even you, Polly, couldn&apos;t serve
                        me as she did Phil, and ever get me back again. If I were you, Miss
                        Comstock, I&apos;d send my mother to talk with her and I&apos;d stay
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tom had gauged Mrs. Comstock rightly. Polly put her arms around Elnora.
                        &quot;Let me go with you, dear,&quot; she begged.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I promised I would speak with her alone,&quot; said Elnora,
                        &quot;and she has to be considered. But thank you, very much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How I shall love you!&quot; exulted Polly, giving Elnora a
                        parting hug.</p>
                    <p>The girl slowly and gravely walked back to the willow. She could not imagine
                        just what was coming, but she was promising herself that she would be very
                        patient and control her temper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you be seated?&quot; she asked politely.</p>
                    <p>Edith Carr glanced at the bench, while a shudder shook her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I prefer to stand,&quot; she said. &quot;Did Mr. Ammon
                        give you the ring you are wearing, and do you consider yourself engaged to
                        him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By what right do you ask such personal questions as
                        those?&quot; inquired Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the right of a betrothed wife. I have been promised to Philip
                        Ammon ever since I wore short skirts. All our lives we have expected to
                        marry. An agreement of years cannot be broken in one insane moment. Always
                        he has loved me devotedly. Give me ten minutes with him and he will be mine
                        for all time.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-434" n="423"/>
                    <p>&quot;I seriously doubt that,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;But I am
                        perfectly willing that you should make the test. I will call him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop!&quot; commanded Edith Carr. &quot;I told you that it
                        was you I came to see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember,&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Ammon is my betrothed,&quot; continued Edith Carr.
                        &quot;I expect to take him back to Chicago with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You expect considerable,&quot; murmured Elnora. &quot;I
                        will raise no objection to your taking him, if you canbut, I tell you
                        frankly, I don&apos;t think it possible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are so sure of yourself as that,&quot; scoffed Edith Carr.
                        &quot;One hour in my presence will bring back the old spell, full force.
                        We belong to each other. I will not give him up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then it is untrue that you twice rejected his ring, repeatedly
                        insulted him, and publicly renounced him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was through you!&quot; cried Edith Carr. &quot;Phil
                        and I never had been so near and so happy as we were on that night. It was
                        your clinging to him for things that caused him to desert me among his
                        guests, while he tried to make me await your pleasure. I realize the spell
                        of this place, for a summer season. I understand what you and your mother
                        have done to inveigle him. I know that your hold on him is quite real. I can
                        see just how you have worked to ensnare him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Men would call that lying,&quot; said Elnora calmly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The second time I met Philip Ammon he told me of his engagement to
                        you, and I respected it. I did by you <pb id="VAA2373-435" n="424"/> as I
                        would want you to do by me. He was here parts of each day, almost daily last
                        summer. The Almighty is my witness that never once, by word or look did I
                        ever make the slightest attempt to interest him in my person or personality.
                        He wrote you frequently in my presence. He forgot the violets for which he
                        asked to send you. I gathered them and carried them to him. I sent him back
                        to you in unswerving devotion, and the Almighty is also my witness that I
                            <hi rend="i">could</hi> have changed his heart last summer, if I had
                        tried. I wisely left that work for you. All my life I shall be glad that I
                        lived and worked on the square. That he ever would come back to me free, by
                        your act, I never dreamed. When he left me I did not hope or expect to see
                        him again,&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora&apos;s voice fell soft and low, &quot;and, behold! You sent
                        himand free!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You exult in that!&quot; cried Edith Carr. &quot;Let me
                        tell you he is not free! We have belonged for years. We always will. If you
                        cling to him, and hold him to rash things he has said and done, because he
                        thought me still angry and unforgiving with him, you will ruin all our
                        lives. If he married you, before a month you would read heart-hunger for me,
                        in his eyes. He could not love me as he has done, and give me up for a
                        little scene like that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is a great poem,&quot; said Elnora, &quot;one line of
                        which reads, &apos;For each man kills the thing he loves.&apos; Let
                        me tell you that a woman can do that also. He did love youthat I concede.
                        But you killed his love <pb id="VAA2373-436" n="425"/> everlastingly, when
                        you disgraced him in public. Killed it so completely he does not even feel
                        resentment toward you. To-day, he would do you a favour, if he could; but
                        love you, no! That is over!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Edith Carr stood truly regal and filled with scorn. &quot;You are
                        mistaken! Nothing on earth could kill that!&quot; she cried, and Elnora
                        saw that the girl really believed what she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are very sure of yourself!&quot; said Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have reason to be sure,&quot; answered Edith Carr.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We have lived and loved too long. I have had years with him to
                        match against your days. He is mine! His work, his ambitions, his friends,
                        his place in society are with me. You may have a summer charm for a sick man
                        in the country; if he tried placing you in society, he soon would see you as
                        others will. It takes birth to position, schooling, and endless practice to
                        meet social demands gracefully. You would put him to shame in a
                        week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hardly think I should follow your example so far,&quot; said
                        Elnora dryly. &quot;I have a feeling for Philip that would prevent my
                        hurting him purposely, either in public of private. As for managing a social
                        career for him he never mentioned that he desired such a thing. What he
                        asked of me was that I should be his wife. I understood that to mean that he
                        desired me to keep him a clean house, serve him digestible food, mother his
                        children, and give him loving sympathy and tenderness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shameless!&quot; cried Edith Carr.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-437" n="426"/>
                    <p>&quot;To which of us do you intend that adjective to apply?&quot;
                        inquired Elnora. &quot;I never was less ashamed in all my life. Please
                        remember I am in my own home, and your presence here is not on my
                        invitation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Carr lifted her head and struggled with her veil. She was very pale and
                        trembling violently, while Elnora stood serene, a faint smile on her lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Such vulgarity!&quot; panted Edith Carr. &quot;How can a
                        man like Ammon endure it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you ask him?&quot; inquired Elnora.
                        &quot;I can call him with one breath; but, if he judged us as we stand,
                        I should not be the one to tremble at his decision. Miss Carr, you have been
                        quite plain. You have told me in carefully selected words just what you
                        think of me. You insult my birth, education, appearance, and home. I assure
                        you I am legitimate. I will pass a test examination with you on any high
                        school or supplementary branch, or French or German. I will take a physical
                        examination beside you. I will face any social emergency you can mention
                        with you. I am acquainted with a whole world in which Philip Ammon is keenly
                        interested, that you scarcely know exists. I am not afraid to face any
                        audience you can get together anywhere with my violin. I am not repulsive to
                        look at, and I have a wholesome regard for the proprieties and civilities of
                        life. Philip Ammon never asked anything more of me, why should
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is plain to see,&quot; cried Edith Carr, &quot;that you
                        took him when he was hurt and angry and kept his <pb id="VAA2373-438"
                            n="427"/> wound wide open. Oh, what have you not done against
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did not promise to marry him when an hour ago he asked me the
                        last time, and offered me this ring, because there was so much feeling in my
                        heart for you, that I knew I never could be happy, if I felt that in any way
                        I had failed in doing justice to your interests. I did slip on this ring,
                        which he had just brought, because I never owned one, and it is very
                        beautiful, but I made him no promise, nor shall I make any, until I am
                        quite, quite sure, that you fully realize he never would marry you if I sent
                        him away this hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know perfectly that if your puny hold on him were broken, if he
                        were back in his home, among his friends, and where he was meeting me, in
                        one little week, he would be mine again, as he always has been. In your
                        heart you don&apos;t believe what you say. You don&apos;t dare trust
                        him in my presence. You are afraid to allow him out of your sight, because
                        you realize what the results would be. Right or wrong, you have made up your
                        mind to ruin him and me, and you are going to be selfish enough to do it.
                        But&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That will do!&quot; said Elnora. &quot;Spare me the
                        enumeration of how I will regret it. I shall regret nothing. I shall not act
                        until I know there will be nothing to regret. I have decided on my course.
                        You may return to your friends.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; demanded Edith Carr.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is my affair,&quot; replied Elnora. &quot;Only this!</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-439" n="428"/>
                    <p>When your opportunity comes, seize it! Any time you are in Philip
                        Ammon&apos;s presence, exert the charms of which you boast, and take
                        him. I grant you are justified in doing it if you can. I want nothing more
                        than I want to see you marry Philip, if he wants you. He is just across the
                        fence under that automobile. Go spread your meshes and exert your wiles. I
                        won&apos;t stir to stop you. Take him to Onabasha, and to Chicago with
                        you. Use every art you possess. If the old charm can be revived I will be
                        the first to wish both of you well. Now, I must return to my guests. Kindly
                        excuse me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora turned and went back to the arbour. Edith Carr followed the fence and
                        passed through the gate into the west woods where she asked Henderson if the
                        car was ready. As she stood near him she whispered, &quot;Take Phil back
                        to Onabasha with us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I say, Ammon, can&apos;t you go to the city with us and help me
                        find a shop where I can get this pinion fixed?&quot; asked Henderson.
                        &quot;We want to lunch and start back by five. That will get us home by
                        midnight. Why don&apos;t you bring your automobile here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am a working man,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I have no time
                        to be out motoring. I can&apos;t see anything the matter with your car,
                        myself; but, of course, you don&apos;t want to break down in the night,
                        on strange roads, with women on your hands. I&apos;ll see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip went into the arbour, where Polly took possession of his lap, fingered
                        his hair, and kissed his forehead and lips.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-440" n="429"/>
                    <p>&quot;When are you coming to the cottage, Phil?&quot; she asked.
                        &quot;Come soon, and bring Miss Comstock for a visit. All of us would be
                        so glad to have her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Philip beamed on Polly. &quot;I&apos;ll see about that,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;Sounds pretty good. Elnora, Henderson is in trouble with his
                        automobile. He wants me to go to Onabasha with him to show him where the
                        doctor lives and help him get fixed so he can start back this evening. It
                        will take about two hours. May I go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, you must go,&quot; she said, laughing lightly.
                        &quot;You can&apos;t leave your sister. Why don&apos;t you go
                        back to Chicago with them? There is plenty of room, and you could have a
                        fine visit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be back in just two hours,&quot; said Ammon.
                        &quot;While I am gone, you be thinking over what we were talking of when
                        the folks came.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Comstock can go with us just as well as not,&quot; said
                        Polly. &quot;That back seat was made for three, and I can sit on your
                        lap.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on! Do come!&quot; urged Ammon instantly, and Tom Levering
                        joined him, but Henderson and Edith silently waited at the gate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, thank you,&quot; laughed Elnora. &quot;That would crowd
                        you, and it&apos;s warm and dusty. We will say good-bye here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She offered her hand to all of them, and when she came to Ammon she gave him
                        one long steady look in the eyes, then shook hands with him also.</p>

                        remarked Mrs. Comstock to Elnora as they watched the automobile speed down
                        the road. As it turned the Limberlost corner, Ammon arose and waved to them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She hasn&apos;t got him yet, anyway,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Comstock, taking heart. &quot;What&apos;s that on your finger, and
                        what did she say to you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora explained about the ring as she drew it off.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have several letters to write, then I am going to change my dress
                        and walk down toward Aunt Margaret&apos;s for a little exercise. I may
                        meet some of them, and I don&apos;t want them to see this ring. You keep
                        it until Philip comes,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;As for what Miss
                        Carr said to me, many things, two of importance. One, that I lacked every
                        social requirement necessary for the happiness of Philip Ammon, and that if
                        I married him I would see inside a month that he was ashamed of me&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, shockins!&quot; scorned Mrs. Comstock. &quot;Go
                        on!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The other was that she has been engaged to him for years, that he
                        belongs to her, and she refuses to give <pb id="VAA2373-442" n="431"/> him
                        up. She said that if he were in her presence one hour, she would have him
                        under a mysterious thing she calls &apos;her spell&apos; again; if
                        he were where she could see him for one week, everything would be made up.
                        It is her opinion that he is suffering from wounded pride, and that the
                        slightest concession on her part will bring him to his knees before
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Comstock giggled. &quot;I do hope the boy isn&apos;t
                        weak-kneed,&quot; she said. &quot;I just happened to be passing the
                        west window this afternoon&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora laughed. &quot;Nothing save actual knowledge ever would have made
                        me believe there was a girl in all this world so infatuated with herself.
                        She speaks casually of her power over men, and boasts of &apos;bringing
                        a man to his knees&apos; as complacently as I would pick up a net and
                        say, &apos;I am going to take a butterfly.&apos; She actually and
                        honestly believes that if Philip were with her a little while she could
                        re-kindle his love for her and awaken in him every particle of the old
                        devotion. Mother, the girl is honest! She is absolutely sincere! She so
                        believes in herself and the strength of Phil&apos;s love for her, that
                        all her life she will believe in and brood over that thought, unless she is
                        taught differently. So long as she thinks that, she will nurse wrong ideas
                        and pine over her blighted life. She must be taught that Phil is absolutely
                        free, and yet he will not go to her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But how on earth are you proposing to teach her that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The way will open.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-443" n="432"/>
                    <p>&quot;Lookey here, Elnora!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock. &quot;That
                        Carr girl is the handsomest dark woman I ever saw. She&apos;s got to the
                        place where she won&apos;t stop at anything. Her coming here proves
                        that. I don&apos;t believe there was a thing the matter with that
                        automobile. I think that was a scheme she fixed up to get Phil where she
                        could see him alone, as she worked to see you. If you are going deliberately
                        to put Philip under her influence again, you&apos;ve got to brace
                        yourself for the possibility that she may win. A man is a weak mortal, where
                        a lovely woman is concerned, and he never denied that he loved her once. You
                        may make yourself downright miserable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, mother, if she won, it wouldn&apos;t make me half so
                        miserable as to marry Phil myself, and then read hunger for her in his eyes!
                        Someone has got to suffer over this. If it proves to be me, I&apos;ll
                        bear it, and you&apos;ll never hear a whisper of complaint from me. I
                        know the real Philip Ammon better in our months of work in the fields, than
                        she knows him in all her years of society engagements. So she shall have the
                        hour she asked, many, many of them, enough to make her acknowledge that she
                        is wrong. Now, I am going to write my letters and take my walk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora threw her arms around her mother and kissed her repeatedly.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t you worry about me,&quot; she said. &quot;I
                        will get along all right, and whatever happens, I always will be your girl
                        and you my darling mother.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-444" n="433"/>
                    <p>She left two sealed notes on her desk. Then she changed her dress, packed a
                        small bundle which she dropped with her hat from the window by the willow,
                        and softly went downstairs. Mrs. Comstock was in the garden. Elnora picked
                        up the hat and bundle, hurried down the road a few rods, then climbed the
                        fence and entered the woods. She took a diagonal course, and after a long
                        walk reached a road two miles west and one south. There she straightened her
                        clothing, put on her hat and a thin dark veil and waited the passing of the
                        next trolley. She left it at the first town and took a train for Fort Wayne.
                        She made that point just in time to climb on the evening train north, as it
                        pulled from the station. It was after midnight when she left the car at
                        Grand Rapids, and went into the depot to await the coming of day.</p>
                    <p>Tired out, she laid her head on her bundle and fell asleep on a seat in the
                        women&apos;s waiting-room. Long after light she was awakened by the roar
                        and rattle of trains. She washed, re-arranged her hair and clothing, and
                        went into the general waiting-room to find her way to the street. She saw
                        him as he entered the door. There was no mistaking the tall, lithe figure,
                        the bright hair, the lean, brown-splotched face, the steady gray eyes. He
                        was dressed for travelling, and carried a light overcoat and a bag. Straight
                        to him Elnora went speeding.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I was just starting to find you!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you!&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are going away?&quot; she panted.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-445" n="434"/>
                    <p>&quot;Not if I am needed. I have a few minutes. Can you be telling me
                        briefly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am the Limberlost girl to whom your wife gave the dress for
                        Commencement last spring, and both of you sent lovely gifts. There is a
                        reason, a very good reason, why I must be hidden for a time, and I came
                        straight to youas if I had a right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have!&quot; answered Freckles. &quot;Any boy or girl
                        who ever suffered one pang in the Limberlost, has a claim to the best drop
                        of blood in my heart. You needn&apos;t be telling me anything more. The
                        Angel is at our cottage on Mackinac. You shall tell her and play with the
                        babies while you want shelter. This way!&quot;</p>
                    <p>They breakfasted in a luxurious car, talked over the swamp, the work of the
                        Bird Woman; Elnora told of her nature lectures in the schools, and soon they
                        were great friends. In the evening they left the train at Mackinaw City and
                        crossed the Straits by boat. Sheets of white moonlight flooded the water and
                        paved a molten path across the breast of it straight to the face of the
                        moon.</p>
                    <p>The island lay a dark spot on the silver surface, its tall trees sharply
                        outlined on the summit, and a million lights blinked around the shore. The
                        night guns boomed from the white fort and a dark sentinel paced the ramparts
                        above the little city tucked down close to the water. A great tenor
                        summering in the north came out on the upper deck of the big boat, and,
                        baring his head, faced the moon and sang, &quot;Oh, the moon shines
                        bright on <pb id="VAA2373-446" n="435"/> my old Kentucky home!&quot;
                        Elnora thought of the Limberlost, of Philip, and her mother, and almost
                        choked with the sobs that would rise in her throat. On the dock a woman of
                        exquisite beauty swept into the arms of Terrence O&apos;More.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Freckles!&quot; she cried. &quot;You&apos;ve been
                        gone a month!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Four days, Angel, just four days by the clock,&quot;
                        remonstrated Freckles. &quot;Where are the children?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Asleep! Thank goodness! I&apos;m worn to a thread. I never saw
                        such inventive, active children. I can&apos;t keep track of
                        them!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have brought you help,&quot; said Freckles. &quot;Here is
                        the Limberlost girl in whom the Bird Woman is interested. Miss Comstock
                        needs a rest before beginning her school work for next year, so she came to
                        us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You dear thing! How good of you!&quot; cried the Angel.
                        &quot;We shall be so happy to have you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In her room that night, in a beautiful cottage furnished with every luxury,
                        Elnora lifted a tired face to the Angel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, you understand there is something back of
                        this?&quot; she said. &quot;I must tell you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; agreed the Angel. &quot;Tell me! If you get it
                        out of your system, you will stand a better chance of sleeping.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora stood brushing the copper-bright masses of her hair as she talked.
                        When she finished the Angel was almost hysterical.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-447" n="436"/>
                    <p>&quot;You insane creature!&quot; she cried. &quot;How crazy of
                        you to turn him over to her! I know both of them. I have met them often. She
                        may be able to make good her boast. But it is perfectly splendid of you!
                        And, after all, really it is the only way. I can see that. I think it is
                        what I should have done myself, or tried to do. I don&apos;t know that I
                        could have done it! When I think of walking off and leaving Freckles with a
                        woman he once loved, to let her see if she can make him love her again, oh,
                        it gives me a graveyard heart. No, I never could have done it! You are
                        bigger than I ever was. I should have turned coward, sure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am a coward,&quot; admitted Elnora. &quot;I am soul-sick!
                        I am afraid I shall lose my senses before this is over I didn&apos;t
                        want to come! I wanted to stay, to go straight into his arms, to bind myself
                        with his ring, to love him with all my heart. It wasn&apos;t my fault
                        that I came. There was something inside that just pushed me. She is
                        beautiful&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I quite agree with you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can imagine how fascinating she can be. She used no arts on me.
                        Her purpose was to cower me. She found she could not do that, but she did a
                        thing which helped her more. She proved that she was honest, perfectly
                        sincere in what she thought. She believes that if she merely beckons to
                        Philip, he will go to her. So I am giving her the opportunity to learn from
                        him what he will do. She never will believe it from anyone else. When she is
                        satisfied, I shall be also.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-448" n="437"/>
                    <p>&quot;But, child! Suppose she wins him back!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is the supposition with which I shall eat and sleep for the
                        next few weeks. Would one dare ask for a peep at the babies before going to
                        bed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, you are perfect!&quot; announced the Angel. &quot;I
                        never should have liked you all I can if you had been content to go to sleep
                        in this house without asking to see the babies. Come this way. We named the
                        first boy for his father, of course, and the girl for Aunt Alice. The next
                        boy is named for my father, and the baby for the Bird Woman. After this we
                        are going to branch out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora began to laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I suspect there will be quite a number of them,&quot; said
                        the Angel serenely. &quot;I am told the more there are the less trouble
                        they make. The big ones take care of the little ones. We want a large
                        family. This is our start.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She entered a dark room and held aloft a candle. She went to the side of a
                        small white iron bed in which lay a boy of eight and another of three. They
                        were perfectly formed, rosy children, the elder a replica of his mother, the
                        other very like. Then they came to a cradle where a baby girl of almost two
                        slept soundly, and looked a picture.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But just see here!&quot; said the Angel. She threw the light on
                        a sleeping girl of six. A mass of red curls swept the pillow. Line and
                        feature the face was that of Freckles. Without asking, Elnora knew the
                        colour and expression of the closed eyes. The Angel handed <pb
                            id="VAA2373-449" n="438"/> Elnora the candle, and, stooping,
                        straightened the child&apos;s body. She ran her fingers through the
                        bright curls and lightly touched the aristocratic little nose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The supply of freckles holds out in my family, you see!&quot;
                        she said. &quot;Both of the girls will have them, and the second boy a
                        few.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stood an instant longer, then, bending, ran her hand caressingly down a
                        rosy bare leg, while she kissed the babyish red mouth. There had been some
                        reason for touching all of them, the kiss fell on the lips which were like
                        Freckles&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>To Elnora she said a tender good night, whispering brave words of
                        encouragement and making plans to fill the days to come. Then she went away.
                        An hour later there was a light tap on the girl&apos;s door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come!&quot; she called as she lay staring into the dark.</p>
                    <p>The Angel felt her way to the bedside, sat down and took Elnora&apos;s
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I just had to come back to you,&quot; she said. &quot;I
                        have been telling Freckles, and he is almost hurting himself with laughing.
                        I didn&apos;t think it was funny, but he does. He thinks it&apos;s
                        the funniest thing that ever happened. He says that to run away from Mr.
                        Ammon, when you had made him no promise at all, when he wasn&apos;t sure
                        of you, won&apos;t send him home to her; it will set him hunting you! He
                        says if you had combined the wisdom of Solomon, Socrates, and all the rest
                        of the wise men, you couldn&apos;t have chosen any course that would
                        have sealed him to you so surely. He feels that now Ammon will <pb
                            id="VAA2373-450" n="439"/> perfectly hate her for coming down there and
                        driving you away. And you went to give her the chance she wanted. Oh,
                        Elnora! It is getting funny! I see it, too!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Angel rocked on the bedside. Elnora faced the dark in silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; gulped the Angel. &quot;I didn&apos;t
                        mean to laugh. I didn&apos;t think it was funny, until all at once it
                        came to me. Oh, dear! Elnora, it <hi rend="i">is</hi> funny! I&apos;ve
                        got to laugh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe it is,&quot; admitted Elnora, &quot;to others; but it
                        isn&apos;t very funny to me. And it won&apos;t be to Philip, or to
                        mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That was very true. Mrs. Comstock had been slightly prepared for stringent
                        action of some kind, by what Elnora had said. The mother instantly had
                        guessed where the girl would go, but nothing was said to Philip. That would
                        have been to invalidate Elnora&apos;s test in the beginning, and Mrs.
                        Comstock knew her child well enough to know that she never would marry
                        Ammon, unless she felt it right that she should. The only way to know was to
                        find out, and Elnora had gone to seek the information. There was nothing to
                        do but wait until she came back, and her mother was not in the least uneasy
                        but that the girl would return brave and self-reliant, as always.</p>
                    <p>Philip Ammon hurried back to the Limberlost, strong in the hope that now he
                        might take Elnora into his arms and receive her promise to become his wife.
                        His first shock of disappointment came when he found her gone.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-451" n="440"/>
                    <p>In talking with Mrs. Comstock he learned that Edith Carr had made an
                        opportunity to speak with Elnora alone. He hastened down the road to meet
                        her, coming back an agitated man. Then search revealed the notes. His read: <text>

                                    <p>I find that I am never going to be able to answer your
                                        question of this afternoon fairly to all of us, when you are
                                        with me. So I am going away a few weeks to think over
                                        matters alone. I shall not tell you, or even mother, where I
                                        am going, but I shall be safe, well cared for, and happy.
                                        Please go back home and live among your friends, just as you
                                        always have done, and on or before the first of September, I
                                        will write you where I am, and what I have decided. Please
                                        do not blame Edith Carr for this, and do not avoid her. I
                                        hope you will call on her and be friends. I think she is
                                        very sorry, and covets your friendship at least. Until
                                        September, then, as ever,</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Comstock&apos;s note was much the same. Ammon was ill with
                        disappointment. In the arbour he laid his head on the table, among the
                        implements of Elnora&apos;s loved work, and gulped down dry sobs he
                        could not restrain. Mrs. Comstock never had liked him so well. Her hand
                        involuntarily crept toward his dark head, then she drew back. Elnora would
                        not want her to do anything whatever to influence him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What am I going to do to convince Edith Carr that I do not love
                        her, and Elnora that I am hers?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess you have to figure that out yourself,&quot; said Mrs.
                        Comstock. &quot;I&apos;d be glad to help you if I could, but it
                        seems to be up to you.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-452" n="441"/>
                    <p>Ammon sat a long time in silence. &quot;Well, I have decided!&quot;
                        he said abruptly. &quot;Are you perfectly sure Elnora had plenty of
                        money and a safe place to go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Absolutely!&quot; answered Mrs. Comstock. &quot;She has
                        been taking care of herself ever since she was born, and she always has come
                        out all right, so far; I&apos;ll stake all I&apos;m worth on it,
                        that she always will. I don&apos;t know where she is, but I&apos;m
                        not going to worry about her safety.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t help worrying!&quot; cried Philip. &quot;I
                        can think of fifty things that may happen to her when she thinks she is
                        safe. This is distracting! First, I am going to run up to see my father.
                        Then, I&apos;ll let you know what we have decided. Is there anything I
                        can do for you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.</p>
                    <p>But the desire to do something for him was so strong with her she scarcely
                        could keep her lips closed or her hands quiet. She longed to tell him what
                        Edith Carr had said, how it had affected Elnora, and to comfort him as she
                        felt she could. But loyalty to the girl held her. If Elnora truly felt that
                        she could not decide until Edith Carr was convinced, then Edith Carr would
                        have to yield or triumph. It rested with Philip. So Mrs. Comstock kept
                        silent, while Philip took the night limited, a bitterly disappointed man.</p>
                    <p>By noon the next day he was in his father&apos;s offices. They had a long
                        conference, but did not arrive at much until the elder Ammon suggested
                        sending for Polly. Anything that might have happened could be explained <pb
                            id="VAA2373-453" n="442"/> after Polly had told of the private
                        conference between Edith and Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Talk about lovely woman!&quot; cried Philip Ammon bitterly.
                        &quot;One would think that after such a dose as Edith gave me, she would
                        be satisfied to let me go my way, but no! Not caring for me enough herself
                        to save me from public disgrace, she must now pursue me to keep any other
                        woman from loving me. I call that too much! I am going to see her, and I
                        want you to go with me, father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Mr. Ammon, &quot;I will go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Edith Carr came into her reception room that afternoon, gowned for
                        conquest, she expected only Philip, and him penitent. She came hurrying
                        toward him, smiling, radiant, ready to use every allurement she possessed,
                        and paused in dismay when she saw his cold face and his father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Phil!&quot; she cried. &quot;When did you come
                        home?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not at home,&quot; answered Philip. &quot;I merely ran
                        up to see my father on business, and to inquire of you what it was you said
                        to Miss Comstock yesterday that caused her to disappear before I could get
                        back to the Limberlost.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Comstock disappear! Impossible!&quot; cried Edith Carr.
                        &quot;Where could she go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought perhaps you could answer that, since it was through you
                        that she went.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Phil, I haven&apos;t the faintest idea where she is,&quot;
                        said the girl gently.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-454" n="443"/>
                    <p>&quot;But you know perfectly why she went! Kindly tell me that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me see you alone, and I will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here and now, or not at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Phil!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you say to the girl I love?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then Edith Carr stretched out her arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Phil, I am the girl you love!&quot; she cried. &quot;All
                        your life you have loved me. Surely it cannot be all gone in a few weeks of
                        misunderstanding. I was jealous of her! I did not want you to leave me an
                        instant that night for any other girl living. That was the moth I was
                        representing. Everyone knew it! I wanted you to bring it to me. When you did
                        not, I knew instantly it had been for her that you worked last summer, she
                        who suggested my dress, she who had power to take you from me, when I wanted
                        you most. The thought drove me mad, and I said and did those insane things.
                        Phil, I beg your pardon! I ask your forgiveness. Yesterday she said that you
                        had told her of me at once. She vowed both of you had been true to meand,
                        Phil, I couldn&apos;t look into her eyes and not see that it was the
                        truth. Oh, Phil, if you understood how I have suffered you would forgive me.
                        Phil, I never knew how much I cared for you! I will do
                        anythinganything!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then tell me what you said to Elnora yesterday that drove her,
                        alone and friendless, into the night, heaven knows where!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have no thought for anyone save her?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-455" n="444"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I have. Because I once loved
                        you, and believed in you, my heart aches for you. I will gladly forgive
                        anything you ask. I will do anything you want, save resume our old
                        relations. That is impossible. It is hopeless and useless to ask
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You truly mean that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then find out from her what I said!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, father,&quot; said Philip rising.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You were going to show Edith Miss Comstock&apos;s
                        letter,&quot; suggested Mr. Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have not the slightest interest in Miss Comstock&apos;s
                        letter,&quot; said Edith Carr.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are not even interested in the fact that she says you are not
                        responsible for her going, and that I am to call on you and be friends with
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is interesting, indeed!&quot; sneered Miss Carr.</p>
                    <p>She took the letter, read and returned it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She has done what she could for my cause, it seems,&quot; she
                        said coldly. &quot;How very generous of her! Do you propose calling out
                        Pinkertons and instituting a general search?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Ammon. &quot;I simply propose to go back
                        to the Limberlost and live with her mother, until Elnora becomes convinced
                        that I am not courting you, and never will be. Then, perhaps, she will come
                        home to us. Good-bye. Good luck to you always!&quot;</p>

                    <p>M<hi rend="sc">ANY</hi> people looked, a few followed, as Edith Carr slowly
                        came down the main street of Mackinac, pausing here and there to note the
                        glow of colour in one small booth after another, overflowing with gay
                        curios. That street of packed white sand, winding with the curves of the
                        shore, outlined with brilliant shops, and thronged with laughing,
                        bare-headed people in outing costumes was a picturesque and fascinating
                        sight. Thousands annually made long journeys and paid exorbitant prices to
                        take part in that pageant.</p>
                    <p>As Edith Carr slowly progressed, she was the most distinguished figure of the
                        old street. Her clinging black gown was sufficiently elaborate for a dinner
                        dress. On her head was a large, wide, drooping-brimmed black hat, with
                        immense floating black plumes, while on the brim, and among the laces on her
                        breast, glowed velvety, deep red roses. Some way these made, up for the lack
                        of colour in her cheeks and lips, and while her eyes seemed unnaturally
                        bright, to a close observer they looked weary. Despite the effort she made
                        to move lightly she was very tired, and dragged her heavy feet with an
                        effort.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-457" n="446"/>
                    <p>She turned at the little street leading down to the dock, and went out to
                        meet the big lake steamer ploughing up the Straits from Chicago. Past the
                        landing place, on to the very end of the pier she went, then sat down,
                        leaned against a dock support and closed her tired eyes. When the steamer
                        came very near she languidly watched the people lining the railing.
                        Instantly she marked one lean anxious face turned toward hers, and with a
                        throb of pity she lifted a hand and waved to Hart Henderson. He was the
                        first man off the boat, coming to her instantly. She spread her trailing
                        skirts and motioned him to sit beside her. Silently they looked across the
                        softly lapping water. At last she forced herself to speak to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you have a successful trip?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I accomplished my purpose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t lose any time getting back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never do when I am coming to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want to go to the cottage for anything?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then let us sit here and wait until the Petosky steamer comes in. I
                        like to watch the boats. Sometimes I study the faces, if I am not too
                        tired.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you seen any new types to-day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. &quot;This has not been an easy day, Hart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And it&apos;s going to be worse,&quot; said Henderson
                        bitterly. &quot;There&apos;s no use putting it off. Edith, I saw
                        someone to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You should have seen thousands,&quot; she said lightly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-458" n="447"/>
                    <p>&quot;I did. But of them all, only one will be of interest to
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Man or woman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lake Shore private hospital.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;An accident?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Nervous and physical breakdown.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Phil said he was going back to the Limberlost.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He went. He was there three weeks, but the strain broke him. He has
                        an old letter in his hands that he has handled until it is ragged. He held
                        it up to me and said, &apos;You can see for yourself that she says she
                        will be well and happy, but we can&apos;t know until we see her again,
                        and that may never be. She may have gone too near that place her father went
                        down, some of that Limberlost gang may have found her in the forest, she may
                        lie dead in some city morgue this instant, waiting for me to find her
                        body.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hart! For pity sake stop!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t,&quot; cried Henderson desperately.
                        &quot;I am forced to tell you. They are fighting brain fever. He did go
                        back to the swamp and he prowled it night and day. The days down there are
                        hot now, and the nights wet with dew and cold. He paid no attention and
                        forgot his food. A fever started and his uncle brought him home.
                        They&apos;ve never had a word from her, or found a trace of her. Mrs.
                        Comstock thought she had gone to O&apos;More&apos;s at Grand Rapids,
                        so when Phil got sick <pb id="VAA2373-459" n="448"/> she telegraphed there.
                        They had been gone all summer, so her mother is as anxious as
                        Phil.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The O&apos;Mores are here,&quot; said Edith. &quot;I
                        haven&apos;t seen any of them, because I haven&apos;t gone out much
                        in the few days since we came, but this is their summer home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, they say at the hospital that it will take careful nursing
                        to save Phil. He is surrounded by stacks of maps and railroad guides. He is
                        trying to frame up a plan to set the entire detective agency of the country
                        to work. He says he will stay there just two days longer. The doctors say he
                        will kill himself when he goes. He is a sick man, Edith. His hands are
                        burning and shaky and his breath was hot against my face.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why are you telling me?&quot; It was a cry of acute anguish.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He thinks you know where she is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not! I haven&apos;t an idea! I never dreamed she would go
                        away when she had him in her hand! I should not have done it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He said it was something you said to her that made her
                        go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That may be, but it don&apos;t prove that I know where she
                        went.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson looked across the water and suffered keenly. At last he turned to
                        Edith and laid a firm, strong hand over hers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith,&quot; he said, &quot;do you realize how serious this
                        is?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose I do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want as fine a fellow as Phil driven any <pb
                            id="VAA2373-460" n="[]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2373-4">
                            <p rend="center">&quot;&apos;Edith, what did you say to Miss
                                Comstock that made her run away from Phil?&apos;&quot;</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2373-461" n="449"/> further? If he leaves that hospital now, and
                        goes out to the exposure and anxiety of a search for her, there will be a
                        tragedy that no after regrets can avert. Edith, what did you say to Miss
                        Comstock that made her run away from Phil?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The girl turned her face from him and sat still, but the man gripping her
                        hands and waiting in agony could see that she was shaken by the jolting of
                        the heart in her breast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, what did you say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What difference can it make?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It might furnish some clue to her action.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It could not possibly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Phil thinks so. He has thought so until his brain is worn enough to
                        give way. Tell me, Edith!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told her Phil was mine! That if he were away from her an hour and
                        back in my presence, he would be to me as he always had been.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, did you believe that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would have staked my life, my soul on it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you believe it now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was no answer. Henderson took her other hand and gripping both of them
                        firmly he said softly, &quot;Don&apos;t mind me, dear. I
                        don&apos;t count! I&apos;m just old Hart! You can tell me anything.
                        Do you still believe that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The beautiful head barely moved in negation. Henderson rathered both her
                        hands in one of his and stretched an arm across her shoulders to the post to
                        support her.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-462" n="450"/>
                    <p>She dragged her hands from him and twisted them together.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Hart!&quot; she cried. &quot;It isn&apos;t fair!
                        There is a limit! I have suffered my share. Can&apos;t you see?
                        Can&apos;t you understand?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he panted. &quot;Yes, my girl! Tell me just this
                        one thing yet, and I&apos;ll cheerfully kill anyone who annoys you
                        further. Tell me, Edith!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she lifted her great, dull, pain-filled eyes to his and cried,
                        &quot;No! I do not believe it now! I know it is not true! I killed his
                        love for me. It is dead and gone forever. Nothing will revive it! Nothing in
                        all this world. And that is not all. I did not know how to touch the depths
                        of his nature. I never developed in him those things he was made to enjoy.
                        He admired me. He was proud to be with me. He thought, and I thought, that
                        he worshipped me; but I know now that he never did care for me as he cares
                        for her. Never! I can see it! I planned to lead society, to make his home a
                        place sought for my beauty and popularity. She plans to further his
                        political ambitions, to make him comfortable physically, to stimulate his
                        intellect, to bear him a brood of red-faced children. He likes her and her
                        plans as he never did me and mine. Oh, my soul! Now, are you
                        satisfied?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She dropped back against his arm exhausted. Henderson held her and learned
                        what suffering truly means. He fanned her with his hat, rubbed her cold
                        hands and murmured broken, incoherent things. By and by great <pb
                            id="VAA2373-463" n="451"/> slow tears slipped from under her closed
                        lids, but when she opened them her eyes were dull and hard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a rag one is when the last secret of the soul is torn out and
                        laid bare!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>Henderson thrust his handkerchief into her fingers and whispered,
                        &quot;Edith, the boat has been creeping up. It&apos;s very near.
                        Maybe some of our crowd are on it. Hadn&apos;t we better get away from
                        here before it lands?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I can walk,&quot; she said. &quot;Oh, I am so dead
                        tired, Hart!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; said Henderson soothingly. &quot;Just try
                        to get past the landing before the boat anchors. If I only dared carry
                        you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>They struggled through the waiting masses, but directly opposite the landing
                        there was a backward movement in the happy, laughing crowd, the gang-plank
                        came down with a slam, and people began hurrying from the boat. Crowded
                        against the fish house on the dock, Henderson could only advance a few steps
                        at a time. He was straining every nerve to protect and assist Edith. He saw
                        no one he recognized near them, so he slipped his arm across her back to
                        help support her. He felt her stiffen against him and catch her breath. At
                        the same instant, the clearest, sweetest male voice he ever had heard
                        called, &quot;Be careful there, little men!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson shot a swift glance toward the boat. Terrence O&apos;More just
                        had stepped from the gang-plank, escorting a little daughter, so like him,
                        it was comical. There followed a picture not easy to describe. The Angel <pb
                            id="VAA2373-464" n="452"/> in the full flower of her beauty, richly
                        dressed, a laugh on her cameo face, the setting sun glinting on her gold
                        hair, escorted by her eldest son, who held her hand tightly and carefully
                        watched her steps. Next came Elnora, dressed with equal richness, a trifle
                        taller and slenderer, almost the same type of colouring, but with different
                        eyes and hair, facial lines and expression. She was led by the second
                        O&apos;More boy who convulsed the crowd by crying, &quot;Tareful,
                        Elnora! Don&apos;t &apos;oo be &apos;teppin&apos; in de
                        water!&quot;</p>
                    <p>People surged around them, purposely closing them in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What lovely women! Who are they? It&apos;s the
                        O&apos;Mores. The lightest one is his wife. Is that her sister? No, it
                        is his! They say he has a title in England.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Whispers ran fast and audible. As the crowd pressed around the party an
                        opening was left beside the fish sheds. Edith ran down the dock. Henderson
                        sprang after her, catching her arm and assisting her to the street.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Up the shore! This way!&quot; she panted. &quot;Everyone
                        will go to dinner the first thing they do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They left the street and started around the beach, but Edith was breathless
                        from running, while the yielding sand made hard walking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Help me!&quot; she cried clinging to Henderson. He put his arm
                        around her, almost carrying her out of sight into a little cove walled by
                        high rocks at the back, while there was a clean floor of white sand, and
                        logs washed from the lake for seats. He found one of these with <pb
                            id="VAA2373-465" n="453"/> a back rest, and hurrying down to the water
                        he soaked his handkerchief and carried it to her. She passed it across her
                        lips, over her eyes, and then pressed the palms of her hands upon it.
                        Henderson removed the heavy hat, fanned her with his, and wet the
                        handkerchief again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hart, what makes you?&quot; she said wearily. &quot;My
                        mother doesn&apos;t care. She says this is good for me. Do you think
                        this is good for me, Hart?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, you know I would give my life if I could save you
                        this,&quot; he said, and could not speak further.</p>
                    <p>She leaned against him, closed her eyes and lay silent so long the man fell
                        into panic.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, you are not unconscious?&quot; he whispered, touching
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Just resting. Please don&apos;t leave me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He held her carefully, softly fanning her. She was suffering almost more than
                        either of them could bear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish your boat was here,&quot; she said at last. &quot;I
                        want to sail fast with the wind in my face.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no wind. I can get my motor around in a few
                        minutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then get it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lie on the sand. I can &apos;phone from the first booth. It
                        won&apos;t take but a little while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Edith lay on the white sand, and Henderson covered her face with her hat.
                        Then he ran to the nearest booth and talked imperatively. Presently he was
                        back bringing a hot drink that was stimulating. Shortly the motor <pb
                            id="VAA2373-466" n="454"/> ran close to the beach and stopped.
                        Henderson&apos;s servant brought a row-boat ashore and took them to the
                        launch. It was filled with cushions and wraps. Henderson made a couch and
                        soon, warmly covered, Edith sped out over the water in search of peace.</p>
                    <p>Hour after hour the boat ran up and down the shore. The moon arose and the
                        night air grew very chilly. Henderson put on an overcoat and piled more
                        covers on Edith.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must take me home,&quot; she said at last. &quot;The
                        folks will be uneasy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was compelled to take her to the cottage with the battle still raging. He
                        went back early the next morning, but already she had wandered out over the
                        island. Instinctively Henderson felt that the shore would attract her. There
                        was something in the tumult of rough little Huron&apos;s waves that
                        called to him. It was there he found her, crouching so close the water the
                        foam was dampening her skirts.</p>
                    <p>&quot;May I stay?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have been hoping you would come,&quot; she answered.
                        &quot;It&apos;s bad enough when you are here, but it is a little
                        easier than bearing it alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank God for that!&quot; said Henderson sitting beside her.
                        &quot;Shall I talk to you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. So they sat by the hour. At last she spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, you know there is something I have got to do,
                        Hart!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-467" n="455"/>
                    <p>&quot;You have not!&quot; cried Henderson violently.
                        &quot;That&apos;s all nonsense! Give me just one word of permission.
                        That is all that is required of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Required&apos;? You grant, then, that there is
                        something &apos;required&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;One word. Nothing more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you ever know one word could be so big, so black, so
                        desperately bitter? Oh, Hart!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you know it now, Hart!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And still you say that it is
                        &apos;required&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson suffered unspeakably. He twisted and fumed impotently. At last he
                        said, &quot;If you had seen and heard him, Edith, you, too, would feel
                        that it is &apos;required.&apos; Remember&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No! No! No!&quot; she cried. &quot;Don&apos;t ask me to
                        remember even the least of my pride and folly. Let me forget!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She sat silent a long time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you go with me?&quot; she whispered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At last she arose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might as well give up and get it over,&quot; she faltered.</p>
                    <p>That was the first time in her life that Edith Carr ever had proposed to give
                        up anything she wanted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Help me, Hart!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson started around the beach assisting her all he could. Finally he
                        stopped.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-468" n="456"/>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, there is no sense in this! You are too tired to go. You know
                        you can trust me. You wait in any of these lovely places and send me. You
                        will be safe, and I&apos;ll run. One word is all that is
                        necessary.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;ve got to say that word myself, Hart!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then write it, and let me carry it. The message is not going to
                        prove who went to the office and sent it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is quite true,&quot; she said dropping wearily, but she
                        made no movement to take the pen and paper he offered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hart, you write it,&quot; she said at last.</p>
                    <p>Henderson turned away his face. He gripped the pen, while his breath sucked
                        between his dry teeth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly!&quot; he said when he could speak.
                        &quot;Mackinac, August 27, 1908. Philip Ammon, Lake Shore Hospital,
                        Chicago.&quot; He paused with suspended pen and glanced at Edith. Her
                        white lips were working, but no sound came. &quot;Miss Comstock is at
                        Terrence O&apos;More&apos;s, on Mackinac Island,&quot; prompted
                        Henderson. Edith nodded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Signed, Henderson,&quot; continued the big man.</p>
                    <p>Edith shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, &apos;She is well and happy,&apos; and sign, Edith
                        Carr!&quot; she panted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not on your life!&quot; flashed Henderson.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For the love of mercy, Hart, don&apos;t make this any harder!
                        It is the least I can do, and it takes every ounce of strength in me to do
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you wait for me here?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-469" n="457"/>
                    <p>She nodded, and, pulling his hat lower over his eyes, Henderson ran around
                        the shore. In less than an hour he was back. He helped her a little farther
                        to where the Devil&apos;s Kitchen lay cut into the rocks; it furnished
                        places to rest, and cool water. Before long his man came with the boat. From
                        it they spread blankets on the sand for her, and made chafing-dish tea. She
                        tried to refuse it, but the fragrance overcame her and she drank ravenously.
                        Then Henderson cooked several dishes and spread an appetizing lunch. She was
                        young, strong, and almost famished for food. She was forced to eat. That
                        made her feel a world better. Then Henderson helped her into the boat and
                        ran it through shady coves of the shore, where there were refreshing
                        breezes. When she fell asleep the girl did not know, but the man did. Sadly
                        in need of rest himself, he ran that boat for five hours through quiet bays,
                        away from noisy parties, and where the shade was cool and deep. When she
                        woke he took her home, and as they went she knew that she had been mistaken.
                        She would not die. Her heart was not even broken. She had suffered horribly;
                        she would suffer more; but eventually the pain must wear out. Into her head
                        crept a few lines of an old opera</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Hearts do not break, they sting and ache,</l>
                        <l n="2">For old love&apos;s sake, but do not die,</l>
                        <l n="3">As witnesseth the living I.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>That evening they were sailing down the Straits before a stiff breeze and
                        Henderson was busy with the <pb id="VAA2373-470" n="458"/> tiller when she
                        said to him, &quot;Hart, I want you to do something more for
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have only to tell me,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have I only to tell you Hart?&quot; she asked softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t you learned that yet, Edith?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to go away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; he said quietly, but his face whitened
                        visibly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You say that as if you had been expecting it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have. I knew from the beginning that when this was over you would
                        dislike me for having seen you suffer. I have grown my Gethsemane in a full
                        realization of what was coming, but I could not leave you, Edith, so long as
                        it seemed to me that I was serving you. Does it make any difference to you
                        where I go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you where you will be loved, and good care taken of
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you!&quot; said Henderson, smiling grimly. &quot;Have
                        you any idea where such a spot might be found?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&apos;It should be with your sister at Los Angeles. She always has seemed
                        very fond of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is quite true,&quot; said Henderson, his eyes brightening
                        a little. &quot;I will go to her. When shall I start?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson began to tack for the landing, but his hands shook until he
                        scarcely could manage the boat. Edith Carr sat watching him indifferently,
                        but her heart was throbbing painfully. &quot;Why is there so much
                        suffering in the world?&quot; she kept whispering to herself.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-471" n="459"/>
                    <p>Inside her door Henderson took her by the shoulders almost roughly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For how long is this, Edith, and how are you going to say good-bye
                        to me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She raised tired, pain-filled eyes to his.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know for how long it is,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;It seems now as if it had been a slow eternity. I wish to my soul
                        that God would be merciful to me and make something &apos;snap&apos;
                        in my heart, as there did in Phil&apos;s, that would give me rest. I
                        don&apos;t know for how long, but I&apos;m perfectly shameless with
                        you, Hart. If peace ever comes and I want you, I won&apos;t wait for you
                        to find it out yourself, I&apos;ll cable, Marconigraph, anything. As for
                        how I say good-bye; any way you please. I don&apos;t care in the least
                        what happens to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson studied her intently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In that case, we will shake hands,&quot; he said
                        &quot;Goodbye, Edith. Don&apos;t forget that every hour I am
                        thinking of you and hoping all good things will come to you
                    soon.&quot;</p>

                        Elnora. &quot;This one may be a thousand times more expensive, and much
                        older than mine; but it wasn&apos;t inspired and taught to sing by a man
                        who knew how. It don&apos;t know &apos;beans,&apos; as mother
                        would say, about the Limberlost.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The guests in the O&apos;More music room laughed appreciatively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you write your mother to come for a visit and
                        bring yours?&quot; suggested Freckles.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did that three days ago,&quot; acknowledged Elnora.
                        &quot;I am half expecting her on the noon boat. That is one reason why
                        this violin gets worse every minute. There is nothing at all the matter with
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Splendid!&quot; cried the Angel. &quot;I&apos;ve begged
                        and begged her to do it. I know how anxious these mothers become. When did
                        you send? What made you? Why didn&apos;t you tell me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;When?&apos; Three days ago. &quot;What made
                        me?&apos; You. &quot;Why didn&apos;t I tell you?&apos;
                        Because I can&apos;t be sure in the least that she will come. Mother is
                        the most individual person. She never does what everyone expects <pb
                            id="VAA2373-473" n="461"/> she will. She may not come, and I
                        didn&apos;t want you to be disappointed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did I make you?&quot; asked the Angel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Loving Alice. It made me realize that if you cared for your girl
                        like that, with Mr. O&apos;More and three other children, possibly my
                        mother, with no one, might like to see me. I know good and plenty I want to
                        see her, and you had told me to so often, I just sent for her. Oh, I do hope
                        she comes! I want her to see this lovely place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have been wondering what you thought of Mackinac,&quot; said
                        Freckles.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it is a perfect picture, all of it! I should like to hang it on
                        the wall, so I could see it whenever I wanted to; but it isn&apos;t
                        real, of course; it&apos;s nothing but a picture.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;These people won&apos;t agree with you,&quot; smiled
                        Freckles.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That isn&apos;t necessary,&quot; retorted Elnora.
                        &quot;They know this, and they love it; but you and I are acquainted
                        with something different. The Limberlost is life. Here it is a carefully
                        kept park. You motor, sail, and golf, all so secure and fine. But what I
                        like is the excitement of choosing a path carefully, in the fear that the
                        quagmire may reach out and suck me down; to go into the swamp naked-handed
                        and wrest from it treasures that bring me books and clothing, and I like
                        enough of a fight for things that I always remember how I got them. I even
                        enjoy seeing a canny old vulture eyeing me as if it were saying,
                        &quot;Ware the sting of the rattler, lest I pick your bones as I did old
                        Limber&apos;s.&apos; I like sufficient <pb id="VAA2373-474" n="462"
                        /> danger to put an edge on things. This is all so tame. I should have loved
                        it when all the homes were cabins, and watchers for the stealthy Indian
                        canoes patrolled the shores. You wait until mother comes, and if my violin
                        isn&apos;t angry with me for leaving it, to-night we shall sing you the
                        Song of the Limberlost. You shall hear the big gold bees over the red,
                        yellow, and purple flowers, bird song, wind talk, and the whispers of Sleepy
                        Snake Creek, as it goes past you. You will know!&quot; Elnora turned to
                        Freckles.</p>
                    <p>He nodded. &quot;Who better?&quot; he asked. &quot;This is secure
                        while the children are so small, but when they get larger, we are going
                        farther north, into real forest, where they can learn self-reliance and
                        develop backbone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora laid away the violin. &quot;Come along, children,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;We must get at that backbone business at once.
                        Let&apos;s race to the playhouse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With the brood at her heels Elnora ran, and for an hour lively sounds stole
                        from the remaining spot of forest on the Island, which lay beside the
                        O&apos;More cottage. Then Terry went to the playroom to bring Alice her
                        doll. He came racing back, dragging it by one leg, and crying,
                        &quot;There&apos;s company! Someone has come that mamma and papa are
                        just tearing down the house over. I saw through the window.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It could not be my mother, yet,&quot; mused Elnora.
                        &quot;Her boat is not due until twelve. Terry, give Alice that
                        doll&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-475" n="463"/>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a man-person, and I don&apos;t know him, but my
                        father is shaking his hand right straight along, and my mother is running
                        for a hot drink and a cushion. It&apos;s a kind of a sick person, but
                        they are going to make him well right away, anyone can see that! This is the
                        best place. I&apos;ll go tell him to come lie on the pine needles in the
                        sun and watch the sails go by. That will fix him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whatch sails go by,&quot; chanted Little Brother.
                        &quot;&apos;At fix him! Elnora fix him, won&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know about that,&quot; answered Elnora.
                        &quot;What sort of a looking person is he, Terry?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A beautiful white person; but my father is going to
                        &quot;colour him up,&apos; I heard him say so. He&apos;s just
                        out of the hospital, and he is a bad person, &apos;cause he ran away
                        from the doctors and made them awful angry. But father and mother are going
                        to doctor him better. I didn&apos;t know they could make sick people
                        well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Ey do anyfing!&quot; boasted Little Brother.</p>
                    <p>Before Elnora missed her, Alice, who had gone to investigate, came flying
                        across the shadows and through the sunshine waving a paper. She thrust it
                        into Elnora&apos;s hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is a man-persona stranger-person!&quot; she shouted.
                        &quot;But he knows you! He sent you that! You are to be the doctor! He
                        said so! Oh, do hurry! I like him heaps!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora read Edith Carr&apos;s telegram to Philip Ammon and understood
                        that he had been ill, that she had been <pb id="VAA2373-476" n="464"/>
                        located by Edith who had notified him. In so doing she had acknowledged
                        defeat. At last Philip was free. Elnora looked up with a radiant face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I like him &quot;heaps&apos; myself!&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;Come on, children, we will go tell him so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Terry and Alice ran, but Elnora had to suit her steps to Little Brother, who
                        was her loyal esquire, and would have been heartbroken over desertion and
                        insulted at being carried. He was rather dragged, but he was arriving, and
                        the emergency was great, he could see that.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s coming!&quot; shouted Alice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s going to be the doctor!&quot; cried Terry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She looked just like she&apos;d seen angels when she read the
                        letter,&quot; explained Alice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She likes you &quot;heaps&apos;! She said so!&quot;
                        danced Terry. &quot;Be waiting! Here she is!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora helped Little Brother up the steps, then deserted him and came at a
                        rush. The stranger-person stood holding out trembling arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you sure, at last, runaway?&quot; asked Philip Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perfectly sure!&quot; cried Elnora.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you marry me now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This instant! That is, any time after the noon boat comes
                        in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why such unnecessary delay?&quot; demanded Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is almost September,&quot; explained Elnora. &quot;I
                        sent for mother three days ago. We must wait until she comes, and we either
                        have to send for Uncle Wesley <pb id="VAA2373-477" n="465"/> and Aunt
                        Margaret, or go to them. I couldn&apos;t possibly be married properly
                        without those dear people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will send,&quot; decided Ammon. &quot;The trip will be a
                        treat for them. O&apos;More, would you get off a message at
                        once?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Everyone met the noon boat. They went in the motor because Ammon was too weak
                        to walk so far. As soon as people could be distinguished at all Elnora and
                        Philip sighted an erect figure, with a head like a snowdrift. When the
                        gang-plank fell the first person across it was a lean, red-haired boy of
                        eleven, carrying a violin in one hand and an enormous bouquet of yellow
                        marigolds and purple asters in the other. He was beaming with broad smiles
                        until he saw Ammon. Then his expression changed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, say!&quot; he exclaimed reproachfully. &quot;I bet you
                        Aunt Margaret is right. He is going to be your beau!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora stooped to kiss Billy as she caught her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There, there!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t knock my headgear into my eye. I&apos;m not
                        sure I&apos;ve got either hat or hair. The wind blew like bizzem coming
                        up the river.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook out her skirts, straightened her hat, and came forward to meet
                        Philip, who took her into his arms and kissed her repeatedly. Then he passed
                        her along to Freckles and the Angel to whom her greetings were mingled with
                        scolding and laughter over her windblown hair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No doubt I&apos;m a precious spectacle!&quot; she said to
                        the <pb id="VAA2373-478" n="466"/> Angel. &quot;I saw your pa a little
                        before I started, and he sent you a note. It&apos;s in my satchel. He
                        said he was coming up next week. What a lot of people there are in this
                        world! And what on earth are all of them laughing about? Did none of them
                        ever hear of sickness, or sorrow, or death? Billy, don&apos;t you go to
                        playing Indian or chasing woodchucks until you get out of those clothes. I
                        promised Margaret I&apos;d bring back that suit good as new.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then the O&apos;More children came crowding to meet Elnora&apos;s
                        mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; cried Mrs. Comstock, gathering them in.
                        &quot;Got everything right here but the tree, and there seems to be
                        plenty of them a little higher up. If this wind would stiffen just enough
                        more to blow away the people, so one could see this place, I believe it
                        would be right decent looking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;See here,&quot; whispered Elnora to Ammon. &quot;You must
                        fix this with Billy. I can&apos;t have his trip spoiled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, here is where I dust the rest of &apos;em!&quot;
                        complacently remarked Mrs. Comstock, as she climbed into the motor car for
                        her first ride, in company with Ammon and Little Brother. &quot;I have
                        been the one to trudge the roads and hop out of the way of these things for
                        quite a spell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She sat very erect as the car rolled into the broad main avenue, where only
                        stray couples were walking. Her eyes began to twinkle and gleam. Suddenly
                        she leaned forward and touched the driver on the shoulder. <pb
                            id="VAA2373-479" n="467"/> &quot;Young man,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;Just you toot that whistle Suddenly and shave close enough it few
                        of those people, so that I can see how I look when I leap for ragweed and
                        snake fences.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The amazed chauffeur glanced questioningly at Ammon, who slightly nodded. A
                        second later there was quick &quot;honk!&quot; and a swerve at a
                        corner. A man engrossed in conversation grabbed the woman to whom he was
                        talking and dashed for the safety of a lawn. The woman tripped in her
                        skirts, and as she fell the man caught and dragged her. Both of them turned
                        red faces to the car and berated the driver. Mr. Comstock laughed in
                        unrestrained enjoyment. Then she touched the chauffeur again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s enough,&quot; she said. &quot;It seems a
                        mite risky.&quot; A minute later she added to Ammmon, &quot;If only
                        they had been carrying six pounds of butter and ten dozen eggs apiece,
                        wouldn&apos;t that have been just perfect?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy had wavered between Elnora and the motor, but his loyal little soul had
                        been true to her, so the walk to the cottage began with him at her side.
                        Long before they arrived the little O&apos;Mores had crowded around and
                        captured Billy, and he was giving them an expurgated version of Mrs.
                        Comstock&apos;s tales of Big Foot and Adam Poe, boasting that Uncle
                        Wesley had been in the camps of Me-shin-go-me-sia and knew Wa-ca-co-nah
                        before he got religion and dressed like white men; while the mighty prowess
                        of Snap as a woodchuck hunter was done full justice. When they reached the
                        cottage</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-480" n="468"/>
                    <p>Ammon took Billy aside, showed him the emerald ring and gravely asked his
                        permission to marry Elnora. Billy struggled to be just, but it was going
                        hard with him, when Alice, who kept close enough to hear, intervened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you let them get married?&quot; she asked.
                        &quot;You are much too small for her. You wait for me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy studied her intently. At last he turned to Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, well! Go on, then!&quot; he said gruffly.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll marry Alice!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice reached her hand. &quot;If you got that settled let&apos;s put
                        on our Indian clothes, get the boys, and go to the playhouse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t got any Indian clothes,&quot; said Billy
                        ruefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you have,&quot; explained Alice. &quot;Father got you
                        some coming from the dock. You can put them on in the playhouse. The boys
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy examined the playhouse with gleaming eyes. Never had he encountered
                        such possibilities. He could see a hundred amusing things to try, and he
                        could not decide which to do first. The most immediate attraction seemed to
                        be a dead pine, held perpendicularly by its fellows, while its bark had
                        decayed and fallen, leaving a bare, smooth trunk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If we just had some grease that would make the dandiest pole to
                        play Fourth of July with!&quot; he shouted.</p>
                    <p>The children remembered the Fourth. It had been great fun.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-481" n="469"/>
                    <p>&quot;Butter is grease. There is plenty in the
                        &apos;frigerator,&quot; suggested Alice speeding away.</p>
                    <p>Billy caught the cold roll and began to rub it against the tree excitedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How are you going to get it greased to the top?&quot; inquired
                        Terry.</p>
                    <p>Billy&apos;s face lengthened. &quot;That&apos;s so!&quot; he
                        said. &quot;The thing is to begin at the top and grease down.
                        I&apos;ll show you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy put the butter in his handkerchief and took the corners between his
                        teeth. He climbed the pole, greasing it as he slid down.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I got to try first,&quot; he said, &quot;because
                        I&apos;m the biggest and so I have the best chance; only the one that
                        goes first hasn&apos;t hardly any chance at all, because he has to wipe
                        off the grease on himself, so the others can get up at last. See?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right!&quot; said Terry. &quot;You go first and then I
                        will, and then Alice. Phew! It&apos;s slick. He&apos;ll never get
                        up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy wrestled Manfully, and when he was exhausted he boosted Terry, and then
                        both of them helped Alice, to whom they awarded a prize of her own doll. As
                        they rested Billy remembered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do your folks keep cows?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, we buy milk,&quot; said Terry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gee! Then what about the butter? Maybe your ma needs it for
                        dinner!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, she don&apos;t!&quot; cried Alice.
                        &quot;There&apos;s stacks of it! I can have all the butter I
                        want.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-482" n="470"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m mighty glad of it!&quot; said Billy.
                        &quot;I didn&apos;t just think. I&apos;m afraid we&apos;ve
                        greased our clothes, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s no difference,&quot; said Terry. &quot;We
                        can play what we please in these things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we ought to be all dirty, and bloody, and have feathers on us
                        to be real Indians,&quot; said Billy.</p>
                    <p>Alice tried a handful of dirt on her sleeve and it streaked beautifully.
                        Instantly all of them began smearing themselves.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If we only had feathers,&quot; lamented Billy.</p>
                    <p>Terry disappeared and shortly returned from the garage with a feather duster.
                        Billy fell on it with a shriek. Around each one&apos;s head he firmly
                        tied a twisted handkerchief, and stuck inside it a row of stiffly upstanding
                        feathers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, if we just only had some pokeberries to paint us red,
                        we&apos;d be real, for sure enough Indians, and we could go on the war
                        path and fight all the other tribes and burn a lot of them at the
                        stake.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice sidled up to him. &quot;Would huckleberries do?&quot; she asked
                        softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; shouted Terry, wild with excitement.
                        &quot;Anything that&apos;s a colour!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice made another trip to the refrigerator. Billy crushed the berries in his
                        hands and smeared and streaked all their faces liberally.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now are we ready?&quot; asked Alice.</p>
                    <p>Billy collapsed. &quot;I forgot the ponies! You got to ride ponies to go
                        on the war path!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-483" n="471"/>
                    <p>&quot;You ain&apos;t neither!&quot; contradicted Terry.
                        It&apos;s the very latest style to go on the warpath in a motor.
                        Everybody does! They go everywhere in them. They are much faster and better
                        than any old ponies.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy gave one genuine whoop. &quot;Can we take your motor?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Terry hesitated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you are too little to run it?&quot; said Billy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not!&quot; flashed Terry. &quot;I know how to start
                        and stop it, and I drive lots for Stephens. It is hard to turn over the
                        engine when you start.&quot;</p>
                    <p>I&apos;ll turn it,&quot; volunteered Billy. &quot;I&apos;m
                        strong as anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;May be it will start without. If Stephens has just been running it,
                        sometimes it will. Come on, let&apos;s try.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy straightened up, lifted his chin and cried, &quot;Houpe! Houpe!
                        Houpe!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The little O&apos;Mores stared in amazement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you come on and whoop?&quot; demanded Billy.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t you know how? You are great Indians! You got to
                        whoop before you go on the warpath. You ought to kill a bat, too, and see if
                        the wind is right. But maybe the engine won&apos;t run if we wait to do
                        that. You can whoop, anyway. All together now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>They did whoop, and after several efforts the cry satisfied Billy, so he led
                        the way to the big motor, and took the front seat with Terry. Alice and
                        Little Brother took the back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will it go?&quot; asked Billy, &quot;or do we have to turn
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-484" n="472"/>
                    <p>&quot;It will go,&quot; said Terry as the machine gently slid out
                        into the avenue, and started under his guidance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is no warpath!&quot; scoffed Billy. &quot;We got to go
                        a lot faster than this, and we got to whoop. Alice, why don&apos;t you
                        whoop?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice arose, took hold of the seat in front and whooped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I open the throttle, I can&apos;t squeeze the bulb to scare
                        people out of our way,&quot; said Terry. &quot;I can&apos;t
                        steer and squeeze, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll whoop enough to get them out of the way. Go
                        faster!&quot; urged Billy.</p>
                    <p>Billy also stood, lifted his chin and whooped like the wildest little savage
                        that ever came out of the West. Alice and Little Brother added their voices,
                        and when he was not absorbed with the steering gear, Terry joined in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Faster!&quot; shouted Billy.</p>
                    <p>Intoxicated with the speed and excitement, Terry threw the throttle wider and
                        the big car leaped forward and shot down the avenue. In it four black,
                        feather-bedecked children whooped in wild glee until suddenly
                        Terry&apos;s war cry changed to a scream of panic.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The lake is coming!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop!&quot; cried Billy. &quot;Stop! Why don&apos;t you
                        stop?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Paralyzed with fear Terry clung to the steering gear and the car sped onward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You little fool! Why don&apos;t you stop?&quot; screamed
                        Billy catching Terry&apos;s arm. &quot;Tell me how to
                        stop!&quot;</p>
                    <p>A bicycle shot along beside them and Freckles standing <pb id="VAA2373-485"
                            n="473"/> on the pedals shouted, &quot;Pull out the pin in that
                        little circle at your feet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Billy fell on his knees and tugged and the pin yielded at last. Just as the
                        wheels struck the white sand the bicycle sheered close, Freckles caught the
                        lever and with one strong shove set the brake. The water flew as the car
                        struck Huron, but luckily it was shallow and the beach smooth. Hub deep the
                        big motor stood quivering as Freckles climbed in and backed it to dry sand.</p>
                    <p>Then he drew a deep breath and stared at his brood. &quot;Terrence, would
                        you kindly be explaining?&quot; he said at last.</p>
                    <p>Billy looked at the panting little figure of Terry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess I better,&quot; he said. &quot;We were playing
                        Indians on the warpath, and we hadn&apos;t any ponies, and Terry said it
                        was all the style to go in automobiles now, so we&quot;</p>
                    <p>Freckles&apos;s head went back, and he did some whooping himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder if you realize how nearly you came to being four drowned
                        children?&quot; he said gravely, after a time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I think I could swim enough to get most of us out,&quot;
                        said Billy. &quot;Anyway, we need washing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do indeed,&quot; said Freckles. &quot;I will head this
                        procession to the garage, and there we will remove the first coat.&quot;
                        For the remainder of Billy&apos;s visit the nurse, chauffeur, and every
                        servant of the O&apos;More household had something of importance on
                        their minds, and Billy&apos;s every step was shadowed.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-486" n="474"/>
                    <p>&quot;I have Billy&apos;s consent,&quot; said Philip to Elnora,
                        &quot;and all the other consent you have stipulated. Before you think of
                        something more, give me your left hand, please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora gave it gladly, and the emerald slipped on her finger. Then they went
                        together into the forest to tell each other all about it, and talk it over.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you seen Edith?&quot; asked Ammon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; answered Elnora, &quot;but she must be here, or
                        she may have seen me when we went to Petosky a few days ago. Her people have
                        a cottage over on the bluff, but the Angel never told me until to-day. I
                        didn&apos;t want to make that trip, but the folks were so anxious to
                        entertain me, and it was only a few days until I intended to let you know
                        myself where I was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I was going to wait just that long, and if I didn&apos;t
                        hear then I was getting ready to turn over the country. I can scarcely
                        realize yet that Edith sent me that telegram.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No wonder! It&apos;s a difficult thing to believe. I
                        can&apos;t express how I feel for her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us never again speak of it,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I
                        came nearer feeling sorry for her last night than I have yet. I
                        couldn&apos;t sleep on that boat coming over, and I couldn&apos;t
                        put away the thought of what sending that message cost her. I never would
                        have believed it possible that she would do it. But it is done. We will
                        forget it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I scarcely think I shall,&quot; said Elnora. &quot;It is
                        the sort of thing I like to remember. How suffering must <pb
                            id="VAA2373-487" n="475"/> have changed her! I would give a great deal
                        to bring her peace.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Henderson came to see me at the hospital a few days ago.
                        He&apos;s gone a pretty wild pace, but if he had been held from youth by
                        the love of a good woman he might have lived differently. There are things
                        about him one cannot help admiring.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think he loves her,&quot; said Elnora softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He does! He always has! He never made any secret of it. He will cut
                        in now and do his level best, but he told me that he thought she would send
                        him away. He understands her thoroughly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Edith Carr did not understand herself. She went to her room after her
                        good-bye to Henderson, lay on her bed and tried to think why she was
                        suffering as she was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is all my selfishness, my unrestrained temper, my pride in my
                        looks, my ambition to be first,&quot; she said. &quot;That is what
                        has caused this trouble.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then she went deeper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How does it happen that I am so selfish, that I never controlled my
                        temper, that I thought beauty and social position the vital things of
                        life?&quot; she muttered. &quot;I think that goes a little past me.
                        I think a mother who allows a child to grow up as I did, who educates it
                        only for the frivolities of life, has a share in that child&apos;s
                        ending. I think my mother has some responsibility in this,&quot; Edith
                        Carr whispered to the night. &quot;But she will recognize none. She
                        would laugh at me if I tried to tell her what I have suffered and the
                        bitter, bitter lesson I have learned.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-488" n="476"/>
                    <p>No one really cares, but Hart. I&apos;ve sent him away, so there is no
                        one! No one!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Edith pressed her fingers across her burning eyes and lay still.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is gone!&quot; she whispered at last. &quot;He would go
                        at once. He would not see me again. I should think he never would want to
                        see me any more. But I will want to see him! My soul! I want him now! I want
                        him every minute! He is all I have. And I&apos;ve sent him away. Oh,
                        these dreadful days to come, alone! I can&apos;t bear it. Hart!
                        Hart!&quot; she cried aloud. &quot;I want you! No one cares but you.
                        No one understands but you. Oh, I want you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She sprang from her bed and felt her way to her desk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get me someone at the Henderson cottage,&quot; she said to
                        Central, and waited shivering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They don&apos;t answer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are there! You must get them. Turn on the buzzer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a time the sleepy voice of Mrs. Henderson answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has Hart gone?&quot; panted Edith Carr.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No! He came in late and began to talk about starting to California.
                        He hasn&apos;t slept in weeks to amount to anything. I put him to bed.
                        There is time enough to start to California when he wakens. Edith, what are
                        you planning to do next with that boy of mine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you tell him I want to see him before he goes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but I won&apos;t wake him.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-489" n="477"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want you to. Just tell him in the
                        morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will be sure?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hart was not gone. Edith fell asleep. She arose at noon the next day, took a
                        cold bath, ate her breakfast, dressed carefully, and leaving word that she
                        had gone to the forest, she walked slowly across the leaves. It was cool and
                        quiet there, so she sat where she could see him coming, and waited. She was
                        thinking hard and fast.</p>
                    <p>Henderson came swiftly down the path. A long sleep, food, and
                        Edith&apos;s message had done him good. He had dressed in new light
                        flannels that were becoming. Edith arose and went to meet him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us walk in the forest,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>They passed the old Catholic graveyard, and went back into the deepest wood
                        of the Island. Back where all shadows were green, all voices of humanity
                        ceased, and there was no sound save the whispering of the trees, a few bird
                        notes and squirrel rustle. There Edith seated herself on a mossy old log,
                        and Henderson studied her. He could detect a change. She was still pale and
                        her eyes tired, but the dull, strained look was gone. He wanted to hope, but
                        he did not dare. Any other man would have forced her to speak. The mighty
                        tenderness in Henderson&apos;s heart shielded her in every way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have you thought of that you wanted yet, <pb id="VAA2373-490"
                            n="478"/> Edith?&quot; he asked lightly as he stretched himself at
                        her feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson lay tense and very still.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I am here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank Heaven for that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson sat up suddenly, leaning toward her with questioning eyes. Not
                        knowing what he dared say, afraid of the hope which found birth in his
                        heart, he tried to shield her and at the same time to feel his way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am more thankful than I can express that you feel so,&quot;
                        he said. &quot;I would be of use, of comfort, to you if I knew how,
                        Edith.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are my only comfort,&quot; she said. &quot;I tried to
                        send you away. I thought I didn&apos;t want you. I thought I
                        couldn&apos;t bear the sight of you, because of what you have seen me
                        suffer. But I went to the root of this thing last night, Hart, and with self
                        in mind, as usual, I found that I could not live without you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson began breathing lightly. He was afraid to speak or move.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I faced the fact that all this is my own fault,&quot; continued
                        Edith, &quot;and came through my own selfishness. Then I went further
                        back and realized that I am as I was reared. I don&apos;t want to blame
                        my parents, but I was carefully trained into what I am. If Elnora Comstock
                        had been like me, Phil would have come back to me. I can see how selfish I
                        look to him, and how I appear to you, if you would admit it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-491" n="479"/>
                    <p>&quot;Edith,&quot; said Henderson desperately, &quot;there is no
                        use to try to deceive you. You have known from the first that I found you
                        wrong in this. But it&apos;s the first time in your life I ever thought
                        you wrong about anythingand it&apos;s the only time I ever will.
                        Understand, I think you the bravest, most beautiful woman on earth, the one
                        most worth loving.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not to be considered in the same class with
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t grant that, but if I did, you must remember how I
                        compare with Phil. He&apos;s my superior at every point.
                        There&apos;s no use in discussing that. You wanted to see me, Edith.
                        What did you want?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t want you to go away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at all?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at all! Not ever! Not unless you take me with you,
                        Hart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She slightly extended one hand to him. Henderson took that hand, kissing it
                        again and again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anything you want, Edith,&quot; he said brokenly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just as you wish it. Do you want me to stay here, and go on as we
                        have been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, only with a difference.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can you tell me, Edith?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;First, I want you to know that you are the dearest thing on earth
                        to me, right now. I would give up everything else, before I would you. I
                        can&apos;t honestly say that I love you with the love you deserve. My
                        heart is too sore. It&apos;s too soon to know. But I love you some way.
                        You are necessary to me. You are my comfort, <pb id="VAA2373-492" n="480"/>
                        my shield. If you want me, as you know me to be Hart, you can consider me
                        yours. I give you my word of honour I will try to be as you would have me,
                        just as soon as I can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson kissed her hand passionately. &quot;Don&apos;t,
                        Edith,&quot; he begged. &quot;Don&apos;t say those things. I
                        can&apos;t bear it. I understand. Everything will come right in time.
                        Love like mine must bring a reward. You will love me some day. I can wait. I
                        am the most patient fellow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I must say it,&quot; cried Edith. &quot;II think, Hart,
                        that I have been on the wrong road to find happiness. I planned to finish
                        life as I started it with Phil; and you see how glad he was to change. He
                        wanted the other sort of girl far more than he ever wanted me. And you,
                        Hart, honest, nowI&apos;ll know if you don&apos;t tell me the truth!
                        Would you rather have a wife as I planned to live life with Phil, or would
                        you rather have her as Elnora Comstock intends to live with him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith!&quot; cried the man, &quot;Edith!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, you can&apos;t say it in plain English,&quot;
                        said the girl. &quot;You are far too chivalrous for that. You
                        needn&apos;t say anything. I am answered. If you could have your choice
                        you wouldn&apos;t have a society wife, either. In your heart
                        you&apos;d like the smaller home of comfort, the furtherance of your
                        ambitions, the palatable meals regularly served, and little children around
                        you. I am sick of all we have grown up to, Hart. When your hour of trouble
                        comes, there is no comfort for you. I am tired <pb id="VAA2373-493" n="481"
                        /> to death. You find out what you want to do, and be, that is a
                        man&apos;s work in the world, and I will plan our home, with no thought
                        save your comfort. I&apos;ll be the other kind of a girl, as fast as I
                        can learn. I can&apos;t correct all my faults in one day, but
                        I&apos;ll change as rapidly as I can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;God knows, I will be different, too, Edith. You shall not be the
                        only generous one. I will make all the rest of life worthy of you. I will
                        change, too!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you dare!&quot; said Edith Carr, taking his head
                        between her hands and holding it against her knees, while the tears slid
                        down her cheeks. &quot;Don&apos;t you dare change, you big-hearted,
                        splendid lover! I am little and selfish. You are the very finest, just as
                        you are!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson was not talking then, so they sat through a long silence. At last
                        he heard Edith draw a quick breath, and lifting his head he looked where she
                        pointed. Up a fern stalk climbed a curious looking object. They watched
                        breathlessly. By lavender feet clung a big, pursy, lavender-splotched,
                        yellow body. Yellow and lavender wings began to expand and take on colour.
                        Every instant great beauty became more apparent. It was one of those
                        double-brooded freaks, which do occur on rare occasions, or merely an Eacles
                        Imperialis moth that in the cool damp northern forest had failed to emerge
                        in June. Edith Carr drew back with a long, shivering breath. Henderson
                        caught her hands and gripped them firmly. Steadily she looked the thought of
                        her heart into his eyes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-494" n="482"/>
                    <p>&quot;By all the powers, you shall not!&quot; swore the man.
                        &quot;You have done enough. I will smash that thing!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no, you won&apos;t!&quot; cried the girl, clinging to
                        his hands. &quot;I am not big enough yet, Hart, but before I leave this
                        forest I shall have grown to breadth and strength to carry that to her. She
                        needs two of each kind. Phil only got her one!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith I can&apos;t bear it! That&apos;s not demanded! Let
                        me take it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may go with me. I know where the O&apos;Mores&apos;
                        cottage is. I have been there often.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll say you sent it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may watch me deliver it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Phil may be there by now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope he is! I should like him to see me do one decent thing by
                        which to remember me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tell you that is not necessary!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not necessary!&apos;&quot; cried the girl, her great eyes
                        shining. &quot;Not necessary? Then what on earth is the thing doing
                        here? I just have boasted that I would change, that I would be like her,
                        that I would grow bigger and broader. As the words are spoken God gives me
                        the opportunity to prove whether I am sincere. This is my test, Hart!
                        Don&apos;t you see it? If I am big enough to carry that to her, you will
                        believe that there is some good in me. You will not be loving me in vain.
                        This is an especial Providence, man! Be my strength! Help me, as you always
                        have done!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson arose and shook the leaves from his clothing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-495" n="483"/>
                    <p>He drew Edith Carr to her feet and carefully picked the mosses from her
                        skirts. He went down to the water and moistened his handkerchief to bathe
                        her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now a dust of powder,&quot; he said when the tears were washed
                        away.</p>
                    <p>From a tiny book Edith tore leaves that she passed over her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All gone!&quot; cried Henderson, critically eyeing her.
                        &quot;You look almost half as lovely as you really are!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Edith Carr drew a wavering breath. She stretched one hand to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold tight, Hart!&quot; she said. &quot;I know they handle
                        these things, but I would quite as soon touch a snake.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Henderson clenched his teeth and held steadily. The moth had emerged too
                        recently to be troublesome. It climbed on her fingers quietly and obligingly
                        clung there without moving. So hand in hand they went down the dark forest
                        path. But when they came to the avenue, the first person they met paused
                        with an ejaculation of wonder. The next stopped also, and everyone
                        following. They could make little progress on account of marvelling,
                        interested people. A strange excitement took possession of Edith. She began
                        to feel proud of the creature.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know,&quot; she said to Henderson, &quot;this is
                        growing easier every step. Its clinging is not disagreeable, as I thought it
                        would be. I feel as if I were saving it, protecting it. I am proud that we
                        are taking it to be put into a collection or a book. It seems like doing a
                        thing worth while. Oh, Hart, I wish we could work together <pb
                            id="VAA2373-496" n="484"/> at something for which people would care as
                        they seem to for this. Hear what they say! See them lift their little
                        children to look at it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Edith, if you don&apos;t stop,&quot; said Henderson,
                        &quot;I will take you in my arms and kiss the face half off you, her on
                        the avenue. You are adorable!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you dare!&quot; laughed Edith Carr. The colour
                        rushed to her cheeks and a new light leaped in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Hart!&quot; she cried. &quot;Let&apos;s work!
                        Let&apos;s do something! That&apos;s the way she makes people love
                        her so. There&apos;s the place, and, thank goodness, there is a
                        crowd.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You darling!&quot; whispered Henderson as they passed up the
                        walk. Her face was rose-flushed with excitement and her eyes shone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, everyone!&quot; she cried as she came on the wide
                        veranda. &quot;Only see what we found up in the forest! We thought you
                        might like to have it for some of your collections.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She held out the moth as she walked straight to Elnora, who arose to meet
                        her, crying, &quot;How perfectly splendid! I don&apos;t even know
                        how to begin to thank you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Elnora took the moth. Edith shook hands with all of them and asked Philip if
                        he were improving. She said a few polite words to Freckles and the Angel,
                        declined to remain on account of an engagement, and went away, gracefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, bully for her!&quot; said Mrs. Comstock.
                        &quot;She&apos;s a little thoroughbred after all!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2373-497" n="485"/>
                    <p>&quot;That was a mighty big thing for her to be doing,&quot; said
                        Freckles in a hushed voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you knew her as well as I do,&quot; said Philip Ammon,
                        &quot;you would have a better conception of what that cost.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was a terror!&quot; cried the Angel. &quot;I never could
                        have done it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never could have done it!&apos;&quot; echoed Freckles.
                        &quot;Why, Angel, dear, that is the one thing of all the world you would
                        have done!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have to take care of this,&quot; faltered Elnora, hurrying
                        for the door to hide the tears which were rolling down her cheeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must help,&quot; said Ammon disappearing also.
                        &quot;Elnora,&quot; he called, catching up with her, &quot;take
                        me where I can cry, too. Wasn&apos;t she great?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Superb!&quot; exclaimed Elnora. &quot;I have no words. I
                        feel so humbled!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So do I,&quot; said Ammon. &quot;I think a great deed like
                        that always makes one feel so. Now are you happy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Unspeakably happy!&quot; answered Elnora.</p>
