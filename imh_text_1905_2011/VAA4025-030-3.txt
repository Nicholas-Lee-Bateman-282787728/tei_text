            The Romance of Thomas 
                  Lincoln
                and Nancy Hanks∗
            
            By LOUIS A. WARREN
            
            A wedding which caused a court of justice to postpone its sessions for a whole day in order that judge,
          lawyers, and litigants might attend the ceremony and wedding festivities, should be of sufficient importance
          to invite an inquiry about the romance so auspiciously crowned.
            So much has been written, however, about the very humble surroundings of the parents of Abraham 
                  Lincoln
               , that any attempt at this late day to weave a bit of romance into the drab and often repulsive
          story might disqualify the effort as valueless from the viewpoint of the historian. If the narrative be based
          on duly authorized public records, one should not begrudge the little dash of color which may appear in this
          new portrait, recalling the romance of Thomas 
                  Lincoln
                and Nancy Hanks.
            Through the central part of 
                  Washington County, Kentucky
               , Beech Fork, a tributary of Salt River, makes a gigantic horseshoe
          as it meanders through the hills and sets apart a section of the country known as Beech land. There came into
          this territory in the late fall of 1786, a widow whose husband, Abraham 
                  Lincoln
               , a few months before had been massacred by the Indians near 
                  Louisville
               . She brought with her an orphaned brood comprising three sons and two daughters. Her youngest
          son, Thomas, was then but ten years of age.
            Closely associated with the widow's husband in his 
                  Kentucky
                land ventures was Hananiah 
                  Lincoln
               , a cousin of the pioneer Abraham. It was his presence in the Beechland community, apparently,
          which caused the widow, so far removed 
                  
                     ∗ This paper was read at the Saturday Luncheon Session of the Annual
              Indiana History Conference at the Claypool Hotel on December 9, 1933.
               
                from her 
                  Virginia
                relatives, to establish herself on 
                  Lincoln
                Run, a branch of Beech Fork.
            Another widow by the name of Lucy Hanks settled about twenty-five miles from the Beech land neighborhood as
          early as 1789. She had one child, a girl not more than five years of age. The Widow Hanks soon remarried,
          however, and began rearing a new family. It was probably some time after this second marriage of her mother
          that. the daughter, Nancy Hanks, went to live with her Uncle Richard and Aunt Rachel Berry. They lived in the
          Beech land section, about a mile from the Widow 
                  Lincoln
               .
            Nancy Hanks was fortunate indeed in finding such a congenial home as she must have had with her aunt and
          uncle. Her cousins, Richard and John Berry had probably married before she came to live with the Berry family,
          but two other cousins, Francis and Edward, were still living at home. It is not likely that in this home there
          was much drudgery to fall to the lot of Nancy Hanks, as there were two negro women, Nan and her daughter,
          Hannah, who must have acted as the family servants.
            In 1798, when Nancy was about thirteen years of age, her Uncle Richard Berry died. From his will and the
          settlement of the estate we learn something about the furnishings of the home in which Nancy Hanks lived,
          There were at least three feather beds and furniture to go with them; seven chairs; a table; a cupboard; two
          spinning wheels; and all of the kitchen ware (including a Dutch oven) which one would expect to find in a
          pioneer home.1
            
            It is interesting to note that in the appraisal list of the estate the name of each horse is given. We are
          wondering if Nancy Hanks did not have the pleasure of naming some of them, a privilege often granted to
          children. There were "Blue-skin," "Lofty," "Cherriot,"
          and a sorrel filly named "Rosy." Possibly the 
                  Kentucky
                thoroughbred that Nancy most often rode was a mare called "Cold Pleasure,"
          which Richard Berry willed to his widow. There was also more than a dozen head of cattle listed—a
          large herd for that early day. Mordecai 
                  Lincoln
               , oldest son of the Widow 
                  Lincoln
               , was one of the appraisers of the estates.2

            Two years after his father's death, Francis Berry married and went to live on a tract of land which
          had been cut off from the old home place.3 Edward, however, remained with his mother, and
          we have every reason to believe that Nancy Hanks continued to live with her Aunt Rachel. On the tax list of 
                  Washington County
                for the year 1800 the name of Rachel Berry appears. She designated that one son was living with
            her.4
            
            During five years of her girlhood days, Nancy had the companionship of another cousin, Sarah 
                  Mitchell
               , who was also an orphan girl. Sarah's mother had been massacred by Indians while the
          family was on its way to 
                  Kentucky
               , and Sarah was captured and taken by the red men to their Indian village. She was not liberated
          until 1795, at the time of 
                  Wayne
               's Greenville Treaty. Thereafter she is said to have been taken into the Richard Berry
          home where she remained until the death of the pioneer and most likely until the time of her marriage in 1800.
          Tradition has it that, although Sarah was somewhat older than Nancy Hanks, Nancy taught her the art of
          spinning and assisted her in again adapting herself to the customs of white people from whom she had been
          separated since her capture.
            The Widow Berry died in 1804, and just where Nancy Hanks lived during the next two years is problematical.
          One tradition has it that she remained in the old Richard Berry home, while another holds that she went to
          live with her cousin Francis Berry. Richard Berry, Jr., had also built a home on the original Berry
          plantation, so it is possible that Nancy may have spent some time in as many as three Berry cabins.
            While Nancy was growing to womanhood, there lived about a mile away, a youth by the name of Thomas 
                  Lincoln
               . Most of the boys in the community were obliged to do manual labor, and Thomas 
                  Lincoln
                was no exception to this rule. Possibly he had to work harder than many of the neighbor boys
          inasmuch as his father was dead. In 1795 he enlisted in the militia, as revealed by the public records, for
          the purpose of protecting the boundaries of 
                  Washington County
                against the Indians.5 He was a member of the Guard of the Fourth Regiment.

                from five to twelve men during his service, it appears that some real
          Indian fighting was experienced by this young soldier. He had witnessed the killing of his father; and
          undoubtedly he had heard Sarah 
                  Mitchell
                tell of the attack made by the Indians near Crab Orchard, 
                  Kentucky
               , in which her mother lost her life and in which she herself was captured. With this background we
          may conclude that Thomas would have no love for the red man.
            When 
                  Lincoln
                became of age, he began to strike out for himself. Although he may have considered 
                  Washington County
                as his home and lived with his widowed mother at intervals, he is found in many different parts
          of the country during the rest of the time the family lived on Beech Fork. In 1797 he is listed on the Hardin
          County tax report as a white male, 21 years old.6 He had gone, apparently to live for a
          time with his father's cousin, Hananiah 
                  Lincoln
               . He worked for several months during this year helping Samuel Haycraft build a mill and raceway
          at 
                  Elizabethtown
               . From there he went to visit his Uncle Isaac 
                  Lincoln
                in 
                  Tennessee
                and worked for him for a season. Later he became associated again with his father's
          cousin, Hananiah, in 
                  Cumberland County, Kentucky
               , not far from the home of his Uncle Isaac.
            In 1801 and 1802 certain events occurred in 
                  Washington County
                which must have set Thomas 
                  Lincoln
                to thinking about his own matrimonial prospects. A series of weddings in the community, including
          three in the widow 
                  Lincoln
               's family undoubtedly directed the attentions of Thomas to Nancy Hanks, who was now
          nearing the age of sixteen. Josiah 
                  Lincoln
               , a brother of Thomas, married "Caty" Barlow; his sister, Mary, married Ralph
          Crume; and even the baby of the family, his younger sister, Ann, was married to William Brumfield. This last
          mentioned wedding united the Lincolns and Berrys, as they both married into the Brumfield family. Both the
          Lincolns and the Berrys married into the Barlow family also. A year before the Lincoln family weddings, Sarah 
                  Mitchell
               , cousin and companion of Nancy Hanks, married John Thompson.7
            
            Something stirred up Thomas 
                  Lincoln
                at this time, and he set out to make a home for himself. His first step was the purchase of a
          farm in Hardin County, in 1803, 100 pounds

                "cash in hand paid."8 He received
          several fees for guarding prisoners, for acting as patrolman, and for serving in other capacities which
          enabled him to accumulate some ready cash. While he had now removed with his mother and two of his married
          sisters to Hardin County and had established himself at 
                  Elizabethtown
                as a cabinet maker, he was not prevented from occasionally riding back to 
                  Washington County
                to visit his brothers and also Miss Nancy Hanks.
            What 
                  Washington County
                girl would not have envied Nancy Hanks when Thomas Lincoln came to call on her? A soldier who had
          fought against the Indians; a cabinet maker by trade; a holder of minor political appointments; the owner of a
          good farm; a young man who had seen something of the country; and from every indication a man of integrity and
          honor who would be eligible for consideration among the best young ladies of the countryside.
            We must not think of Thomas 
                  Lincoln
                as an uncouth swain who wore unbecoming clothes and rode a moth-eaten horse. In fact, Thomas must
          have been quite a dandy for those days. In 1805 he bought a hat from an 
                  Elizabethtown
                merchant for which he paid $8.75, a pair of suspenders costing $2.19, and
          other items to show that the rest of his apparel was in keeping with these purchases. Throughout the years
          1804 and 1805, he carried a substantial credit to his account with Elizabeth-town merchants.9
            
            The climax of Thomas 
                  Lincoln
               's economic adventures occurred in 1806 when he was engaged during March and April by
          Bleakly and 
                  Montgomery
               , 
                  Elizabethtown
                storekeepers, to go to 
                  New Orleans
                with merchandise. By May 1 he had returned, and on May 16 he is credited on the day book of the
          firm with these two items expressed in English pounds: 
                  
                     Going to 
                           New Orleans
                        
                     
                     16.10

                Although the pound may have been exchanged somewhat at a discount, this trip must have netted him
          about $150.00.
            Immediately after his return from 
                  New Orleans
               , Thomas Lincoln began preparing for his wedding. We are able to give an itemized account of some
          of his purchases on two certain days in the month of May, 1806:

            The day book also shows that Lincoln drew, on his store credit, the sum of $112.70 cash,
          undoubtedly used in further preparations for the wedding. He continued to make purchases at the store
          throughout the month and until June 4. On June 2 he bought a new bridle for his horse.10
            
            With such extensive preparations being made on the part of Thomas for the wedding we cannot think that Nancy
          was idle. A sketch comes down to us through a grand-daughter of the companion and cousin of Nancy Hanks, Sarah 
                  Mitchell
               , which is probably a true picture of Nancy's industry: 
                  Sarah 
                        Mitchell
                      was the pupil of Nancy Hanks in learning to spin flax, the latter being adept in that now
              lost art. It was the custom in those days to have spinning parties, on which occasion the wheels of the
              ladies were carried to the house designated, to which the competitors, distaff in hand, came ready for the
              work of the day. At a given hour the wheels were put in motion, and the flimsy fibre took the form of
              firmly lengthened strands in their mystic hands. Tradition says that Nancy Hanks generally bore the palm,
              her spools yielding the longest and finest thread.11

            Although it is doubtful whether a trustworthy description of Nancy Hanks at the time of her wedding is
          available, there is a sketch portraying her in later years, from which we have eliminated certain statements
          about her appearance which would not be true to her earlier years. Possibly the following picture may give
          some idea of how she looked: 
                  A slender symmetrical woman, of medium stature, a brunette with dark hair, regular features and soft,
              sparkling hazel eyes. Tenderly bred she might have been beautiful…. By her family she was
              considered something wonderful. John Hanks spoke of her "high, intellectual forehead"
              which he considered but the proper seat of faculties like hers.12
                  
               
            
            From many sources comes the information that she was well educated for that day, as were all of her cousins
          and other kinfolk in 
                  Washington County
               . Original manuscripts written by the Berrys, Mitchells, and others, are still extant. One
          biographical sketch of Nancy Hanks, which was approved by no less an authority than Abraham 
                  Lincoln
                himself, states that she was "a ready reader" and read the Bible to him
          (Abraham) habitually.13 Nancy's cousin, John Berry, oldest son of Richard Berry,
          Sr., died in 1795 and the settlement of his estate reveals that his two daughters, Peggy and Rachel, were
          being educated in a subscription school.14
            
            There are records which confirm that there was literature in the homes where Nancy lived and visited. Joann
          Brum-field, cousin of Nancy, bought a Bible in the year 1800,15 paying for it the sum of
          one pound, four shillings, and sixpence. Francis Berry, in 1804, purchased a dictionary for sixteen shillings,
          the only book sold at the sale he was attending.16 We may feel sure that the bride to be
          of Thomas 
                  Lincoln
                was not an illiterate.
            With the arrangements for the wedding about completed, Thomas 
                  Lincoln
                had one more important task to perform. It was necessary that he should go to the clerk of the
          county where his prospective bride resided and give a bond affirming that there was no lawful cause to
          obstruct the contemplated wedding. This he did on Monday, June 10, and Richard Berry, cousin of the bride, as
          guardian of Nancy Hanks, signed the 
                  
                     12 Ward H. Lamon, The Life of Abraham 
                           Lincoln

                bond with him. Upon the signing of such a bond the clerk would issue a
          license to marry.17
            
            On the same day it is possible that he also saw the Rev. Jesse Head and asked him to perform the wedding
          ceremony. We have evidence that the preacher was in the 
                  Washington County
                Court House on that day, as he signed a court order in the suit of Williams vs. Meagan, bearing
          the date June 10, 1806.18
            
            With all of the preliminaries for the wedding completed by the families of both bride and groom we are now
          ready to look in upon the wedding which was the happy climax to this courtship of the Widow 
                  Lincoln
               's youngest son and the niece of pioneer Richard Berry.
            On occasions when the writer visited in 
                  Washington County, Kentucky
               , he heard traditions about the court being adjourned
          for the day, that the judge and lawyers might attend the wedding. Such a story, however, did not seem to fit
          in very well with the background usually built up for the parents of Abraham 
                  Lincoln
               .
            Recent discoveries have revealed that these young people did have connections among the outstanding citizens
          of 
                  Washington County
                which would make their marriage of interest to a large group of people. Furthermore, the writer
          has discovered documentary evidence that the Circuit Court was convened in the 
                  Washington County
                Court House during the day immediately preceding and the day immediately following the wedding.
          The court did meet on Monday, June 9, Tuesday, June 10, and Wednesday, June 11. On the day of the wedding,
          Thursday, June 12, however, no sessions were held, all suits being postponed until Friday, the 13th, when the
          court was in session again.19
            
            Of course, there is no entry which states that the court dismissed on Thursday, June 12, on account of the
          wedding, but these facts may be observed: Richard Berry, guardian of Nancy Hanks, and several other relatives
          of the bride, had business in the court or were serving on juries. Furthermore, Mordecai 
                  Lincoln
               , brother of the groom, was defendant in two cases called for June 12, the wedding day: Elias
          Davidson vs. Mordecai

                  Lincoln
               .20 Jesse Head, the minister chosen to perform the ceremony, was also a
          magistrate, and the records show that he, likewise, had business in the Circuit Court on this day. It looks
          very much as if the old tradition about the court being closed on account of the wedding has been
          substantiated.
            With a wedding of sufficient importance to stop the wheels of justice, another tradition referring to it
          which has always seemed to lack the authenticity to give it a favorable acceptance by historians now assumes
          the role of an historical document. Christopher C. Graham, who claimed to have been present at the wedding,
          gave the following account of what took place: 
                  I saw Nancy Hanks 
                        Lincoln
                      at her wedding, a fresh-looking girl, I should say over twenty. Tom was a respectable
              mechanic and could choose…. I was at the infare, too. We had bear-meat; venison, wild turkey
              and ducks; eggs, wild and tame; maple sugar, swung on a string, to bite off for coffee or whiskey; syrup
              in big gourds, peach and honey; a sheep that the two families barbecued whole over coals of wood burned in
              a pit, and covered with green boughs to keep the juices in; and a race for the whiskey bottle.21.
               
            
            While there is no way of learning with any degree of certainty just who attended the wedding, these guests,
          all related to the bride, were probably there: Lucy Shipley [Hanks] Sparrow, mother of the bride, and her
          husband, Henry Sparrow; Richard Berry, Jr., cousin and guardian of Nancy Hanks, who undoubtedly gave the bride
          away, and his wife Polly Ewing Berry; Sarah 
                  Mitchell
                Thompson, cousin of Nancy, who most likely stood up with her, and John Thompson, husband of
          Sarah; Francis Berry, cousin, and his wife, Betsy Brazelton Berry; Edward Berry, cousin; Joanna Berry 
                  Mitchell
               , cousin; James 
                  Mitchell
               , cousin, and his wife, Betsy Brumfield 
                  Mitchell
               ; Daniel 
                  Mitchell
               , cousin, and his wife, Jane Berry 
                  Mitchell
               , also a cousin; Ann 
                  Mitchell
                [Berry] Deathan, cousin, and her two daughters, Peggy and Rachel Berry. There was, of course,
          also a group of Hankses present, including several uncles and aunts and Hanks cousins too numerous to mention.
            The chief place of honor among the groom's relatives, would be given to the Widow Bersheba 
                  Lincoln
               , mother of the

                groom; then would follow the two brothers, Mordecai and Josiah, with
          their wives, Mary Mudd 
                  Lincoln
                and Caty Barlow 
                  Lincoln
               , respectively. One of these brothers probably acted as best man. The two sisters, Mary and Ann,
          would be present with their husbands, Ralph Crume and William Brumfield, respectively. The intermarriages of
          the brothers and sisters of Thomas with prominent families in the Beech land community would make a large
          number of "in-laws" eligible to attend. One fact about this wedding is certain; it did not
          lack for guests who were in some way related to the young couple, to say nothing of neighbors who would
          attend.
            The old Berry cabin in which the wedding of Thomas 
                  Lincoln
                and Nancy Hanks is said by tradition to have taken place is still preserved. In 1911 it was moved
          from its original site in Beech land, in 
                  Washington County
               , to a plot of ground adjacent to the Pioneer Cemetery at Harrodsburg, 
                  Kentucky
               .
            On June 12,1931, the one hundred twenty-fifth anniversary of the wedding, this historic cabin was enshrined
          within a beautiful and appropriate structure in the form of a brick church following an architectural design
          of the old Lulbegrud Church which was erected in 
                  Kentucky
                in 1799. This shrine, made possible by the generosity of Mrs. Edmund Burk Ball of 
                  Muncie
               , Indiana, stands as a memorial to a pioneer wedding of more than usual importance which sealed a
          romance of the pioneer days and joined together the parents of Abraham 
                  Lincoln

               's among the first five, probably among the first three. He was a great humanitarian, a
          benefactor to his fellow men, The historian Lecky says that he was "one of a very small class of men
          who can be said to have added something of real value to the art of living. Very few writers have left so many
          profound and original observations on the causes of success in life, and on the best means of cultivating the
          intellect and the character. To extract from surrounding circumstances the largest possible amount of comfort
          and rational enjoyment, was the ideal he placed before himself and others, and he brought to its attainment
          one of the shrewdest and most inventive of human intellects, one of the calmest and best balanced of human
          characters."
            Think for a moment of what 
                  Franklin
                achieved for the benefit of mankind: 
                  He established the first circulating library in America.
                  He introduced new methods for fighting fires, and suggested the lightning rod to prevent them. He
              proposed the first city fire department in America.
                  He may be said to be the first discoverer or promotor of electrical power. Turgot said that, "He
              snatched the lightning from the clouds, the secptre from tyrants." By his demonstration that
              lightning was an electrical phenomenon he "brought deliverance for mankind from an ancient
              terror."
                  He was the first to bring about paved streets in the city, to keep the citizens' feet out of the
              mud and the dust and dirt out of the public markets.
                  He taught the people the value of ventilation. The 
                        Franklin
                      stove saved fuel, heated the room, and brought about better ventilation in the home. He
              contended 
                        
                           ∗ This paper was presented before the Saturday afternoon session of
                  the Annual Indiana History Conference which was held on December 8-9 at the Claypool Hotel in 
                              Indianapolis
                           .
                     
                      that influenzas and colds were contagious and were caused by impure
              air, lack of exercise, or overeating. The germ theory came a century and a half later.
                  He showed his fellow citizens how to remedy smoky chimneys.
                  He was the first to propose a city police department for the detection and suppression of crime.
                  Printing had already been invented when he came upon the scene, but nobody ever did more than he to
              illustrate its educational uses. He well exemplified Jefferson's familiar maxim that a free
              newspaper was more important to the safety of a people than a standing army.
                  For twenty-five years he published "Poor Richard's Almanac," which he made a
              vehicle for diffusing through the colonies a vast amount of practical knowledge and homely wisdom. He made
              an indelible impression upon his countrymen. Perhaps no man in history ever did more to fashion the
              thought and customs of a people.
                  He was the first to see the need of paper currency, and plenty of it.
                  Among the men of his time he was the most potent friend of public education. He may be called the founder
              of the University of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     .
                  He has been called the first American economist, and the first real literary light of America. His
              Autobiography became a classic for all time.
                  He was a versatile genius, an inventor, a scientist, a philosopher and the greatest of American
              diplomats. He obtained the Treaty of Alliance with 
                        France
                      in 1778, and next to 
                        Washington
                     , no one did more than he to bring about American independence.
                  He was one of the makers of the American constitution, and nothing did more than his wisdom, wit, and
              sound sense to bring about the compromises and the final adoption of that historic document.
               
            
            So much for 
                  Franklin
               , the man. What did he contribute towards the peace treaty of 1783 that recognized American
          independence? He was a friend of peace. Keen and caustic as  was his wit,
          it was not adequate to express his contempt and abhorrence of war as a mode of settling disputes arising among
          nations. He hoped for peace in his life time. "I long to see peace before I die," he said,
          "to which I shall with infinite pleasure contribute everything within my power." In his old
          age he said that he had lived long, but that he had "never seen a good war nor a bad peace."
          If the British king and his ministry had listened to 
                  Franklin
               's wise counsel there would have been no American war. For the sake of humanity 
                  Franklin
                was now urging haste to put an end to what he called "this abominable war." He
          was interested in promoting the happiness of mankind rather than in spreading misery and devastation. He
          talked and acted a good deal like a pacifist.
            Hating war as he did, when this war was brought to an end, 
                  Franklin
                was especially interested in obtaining a durable peace. He would, therefore, avoid giving
          occasion for future wars. It was this motive that prompted his well known suggestion that Britain should cede 
                  Canada
                to America. It was not a claim, but it was a bold proposal, promoted by a noble motive.
          Parliament had shown its desire for reconciliation. "It is a sweet word," said 
                  Franklin
               . "It means more than peace. Nations make peace when both are weary of war. If one power
          has made war upon another unjustly and has wantonly done it great injury and refuses reparation, though peace
          may come, resentment will remain and war will break out again as occasion offers."
            The territories of the 
                  United States
                and of 
                  Canada
                would touch each other on long frontiers. 
                  Canada
                in English hands would be a cause of future quarrels. The settlers on a frontier are generally
          disorderly. Being far removed from the eye and control of their governments they are more bold in committing
          offenses against their neighbors, furnishing fresh differences and complaints.
            
               
                  Franklin
                was right in this contention. For nearly forty years 
                  Canada
                was a source of quarrels between the two powers. It was impossible for 
                  Franklin
                to foresee the famous treaty for disarmament—the Rush-Bagot treaty of
          1818—by which the 3000 miles of frontier were left without a fort, a warship, a gun, or a soldier.
          By this new policy of mutual confidence among nations, the two English-speaking powers, so long estranged, now
          ceased to threaten one another with  arms and have lived in peace and
          amity together for over a hundred years, without frontier defenses or armaments. Nothing would more have
          rejoiced 
                  Franklin
               's soul than that. It must have given peace to his sleep and have led him to feel that
          his peace-loving spirit was marching on.
            
               
                  Franklin
                held stoutly to the view that Great Britain had been the aggressor in the War of the Revolution.
          She had treated her American subjects with cruelty. It would now be becoming that she should show concern for
          the past and a disposition toward reparation. The effect would be greater if the cession of 
                  Canada
                were voluntary. Let 
                  England
                offer to relieve those who had suffered from scalping and burning parties. True, lives could not
          be restored, but houses could be rebuilt. 
                  France
                had ceded 
                  Canada
                to Britain in 1763 largely with a view of weakening the ties between 
                  England
                and her colonies, and this had been the outcome. Very soon colonial rebellion in America began.
          Oswald had expressed to 
                  Franklin
                the opinion that the cession of 
                  Canada
                to Britain in 1763 had hastened the outbreak of the rebellion and, therefore, had been injurious
          to Britain. Now 
                  Franklin
                argued that 
                  England
               's holding 
                  Canada
                would lead to future quarrels with America. Peace would never be secure nor cordiality subsist.
          The union between the 
                  United States
                and 
                  France
                would be strengthened instead of reunion or restored friendliness between 
                  England
                and America. Therefore 
                  England
                could afford to be generous.
            The fur trade was 
                  England
               's chief advantage in owning 
                  Canada
               . The profit would not offset the expense of government. It might be humiliating to Britain to
          give up 
                  Canada
                on the demand of the 
                  United States
               . Let it be said that America may not demand it. Her rulers may consider the fear of such a
          neighbor as a means of keeping the States united among themselves and lead them to give more attention to
          military discipline. Men of military ambition may promote a military power in America from fear of the English
          control of 
                  Canada
               .
            On the mind of the people the effect of the voluntary cession of 
                  Canada
                would be excellent. Let Britain always enjoy free trade there, and let as much vacant land be
          sold as would be necessary to restore the houses burnt by British troops and their Indians, and to indemnify
          the Tories for their confiscated estates.
            
            Such were 
                  Franklin
               's observations on 
                  Canada
               . They were submitted to Oswald, committeed to paper, and carried by Oswald to Shelburne, now
          minister for the colonies. 
                  Franklin
                won Oswald to his view, and he stood ready to do what he could to promote it. Oswald was regarded
          by 
                  Franklin
                as a "plain, sincere man having no desire but that of being useful in doing
          good." Oswald had long resided in America and was well acquainted with American affairs. Through his
          wife he had acquired extensive estates here. He was a practical and honest man, of liberal views—an
          intelligent disciple of Adam Smith. Oswald brought back a favorable report from Shelburne, who thought the
          matter might be satisfactorily arranged. So 
                  Franklin
                was not looking toward the impossible.
            These were but preliminary conversations. 
                  Franklin
                reported them to John Adams, who also, hoped to see 
                  Canada
                and 
                  Nova Scotia
                ceded to America by the British. 
                  Franklin
                well knew that he had no right to treat without his colleagues and he thought he had no right to
          do so without the knowledge of the French.
            
               
                  Franklin
               's colleagues in the negotiations, John Adams and John Jay, thought 
                  Franklin
                was too much pro-French, that he was too much influenced by the wishes and policies of the French
          court. It is true that Franklin never failed to express fully America's obligation to 
                  France
               , for "assistance afforded to us in our distress, and for the generous and noble manner
          in which it was granted, asking no advantage in return." 
                  Franklin
                had long lived in 
                  France
               . He had learned the language and customs of the country. He liked French manners and he had
          acquired a French mind in its grace and elasticity. He admired many of the men of 
                  France
                and some of her women. He had the tolerance and complaisance which gave him an entré and acceptance in the salons and court circles of 
                  France
               . He thought the colonies were more likely to obtain their object by a firm reliance on 
                  France
                than by trusting the generosity of 
                  England
               . He pointed to the Treaty of Alliance (1778) which forbade either party to conclude a separate
          peace without the consent of the other. He felt that this imposed a moral and legal obligation on his
          countrymen to follow on in the policy which their interests had required them to adopt.
            It is true, too, that Franklin held loyally to the instructions  which
          Congress had given the peace commissioners, that they should maintain confidential relations with the French
          ministers, that they were to undertake nothing in the negotiations for peace without French knowledge or
          concurrence, and that they were to be governed by the advice and opinion of the French ministers. The
          instructions were clear: 
                  You are to make the most candid and confidential communication upon all subjects to the ministers of our
              generous ally, the King of 
                        France
                     ; to undertake nothing in the negotiation for peace or truce without their knowledge or
              concurrence, and to make them sensible how much we rely upon his Majesty's influence for
              effectual support in every thing that may be necessary to the present security or future prosperity of the 
                        United States
                      of America.
               
            
            Jay and Adams disagreed with 
                  Franklin
                as to the binding force of these restrictions. "Would you break the instructions of
          Congress?" Jay was asked. "Yes," he said, "as I would this pipe,"
          which he threw with vigor against the coal grate before him. Jay and Adams were suspicious of 
                  France
               . They thought the instructions of Congress had been obtained by French influence, in harmony with
          French interests, and, probably, by French corruption. Not for an hour did 
                  Franklin
                waver in patriotic support of his country's interest, but he thought the ends sought
          could be obtained without offending or breaking with the French ministers. He finally cooperated with Adams
          and Jay in carrying on some preliminary negotiations with Britain without letting Vergennes in on what they
          were doing. That the negotiations turned out so well and French friendship was still retained was largely
          owing to 
                  Franklin
               's diplomatic finesse.
            Shelburne asserted that suitable compensation for the Loyalists, or Tories, was always uppermost in the mind
          of the British ministry. On this he would insist. 
                  Franklin
                was not friendly toward the Tories; he thought nothing should be done for them. Shelburne speaks
          of his "vindictive hatred" toward them. 
                  Franklin
                recalled the burning of towns and the ravages of British troops on the coasts, events which he
          thought must render the British name odious in America to the latest generations. The resentment has lasted
          long; it may not be dead yet. Now "we are asked," said 
                  Franklin
               , "to receive again into our bosoms our bitterest enemies, to restore their properties
          who have destroyed ours, and this while our  wounds are still
          bleeding." Thus he referred to the Tories.
            
               
                  Franklin
                thought it better to drop all mention of these refugees. "If you insist on caring for
          them," he said, "let us balance accounts and you pay if the balance be in our
          favor." If the Loyalists were to be compensated it must be done by 
                  England
               , not by America. Congress had no power to repeal such laws of confiscation as had been passed by
          the several States. That was a state affair. Congress could not even give power to her commissioners to treat
          on such a matter. 
                  Franklin
                urged that not even 
                  England
                was under any great obligation to these refugees, since it was "their misrepresentations
          and bad counsels that had drawn 
                  England
                into this miserable war." Any obligation of ours was more, than offset by the British
          ravages along our coasts.
            
               
                  Franklin
                called attention to the fact that every one of the present British ministers had, while in the
          ministry, declared the war against us to be unjust. Nothing is clearer than that those who injure others by an
          unjust war should make reparations. And now some of the British want to bring their boundary down to the 
                  Ohio
               , and make compensations to the Tories by giving them lands there for settlements. Knowing that
          Americans expected to settle there themselves, 
                  Franklin
                declared, "we do not choose such neighbors."
            Shelburne laid much stress not only on the claims of the Loyalists but also on the debts due to British
          merchants from the colonists before the war began. Lecky calls this "a question of the simplest
          honesty." The old debts still outstanding when the troubles began were due chiefly to 
                  Glasgow
                merchants. There the Americans had been unwilling or unable to pay. On this issue, also, 
                  Franklin
                was disposed to do very little to satisfy the English demand. He strenuously opposed it. What
          Lecky calls his "ingenious" plea on this theme is well known. 
                  Franklin
               's recital of "facts" on which he based his plea carries considerable
          weight: 
                  There existed a free commerce, upon mutual faith, between Britain and America. The merchants of the
              former credited the merchants and planters of the latter with great quantities of goods. 
                        England
                     , before the goods are sold in America, sends an armed force, seizes those goods in the
              stores—some even in the ships that brought them—and carries them off; seizes also
              and carries off the tobacco, rice, and indigo provided by the planters to make returns, and even the
              negroes  from whose labor they might hope to raise other produce for
              that purpose.
                  Britain now insists that the debts shall, nevertheless, be paid.
                  Will she, can she justly refuse making compensation for such seizures?
                  If a draper who had sold a piece of linen to a neighbor on credit should follow him and take the linen
              from him by force, and then send a bailiff to arrest him for the debt, would any court of law or equity
              award the payment of the debt without ordering a restitution of the cloth?
               
            
            This plea seems all right and sound enough for the equity of peace, but the laws of war have little regard
          for the pleas of equity and justice. The English claim, though not provided for, was recognized. Lecky says
          that John Adams' "sense of honor was much higher" than that of 
                  Franklin
                and he quotes Adams to the effect that "he had no notion of cheating anybody,"
          and that the questions "of paying debts and compensating Tories were two." Adams would
          recognize the debts, but compensating the Tories was another question. The debt dispute was finally settled by
          a general clause in the Treaty that creditors on either side shall meet with no lawful impediment to the
          recovery of debts. This amounted to no more than that Congress would recommend to the States that they should
          put no legal impediments in the way of the collection of the debts. It was a futile recommendation until after
          the adoption of the new Constitution. Then decisions of State courts might be over-ruled by decisions of the
          Supreme Court of the 
                  United States
               , and they were so over-ruled.
            There was some dissension in the British ministry in the process of peace making. Fox was the minister for
          foreign affairs, Shelburne for the colonies. Each claimed that the negotiations fell within his office. Fox
          would recognize American independence forthwith and on that basis negotiate the terms of peace. Shelburne
          would negotiate first, and recognize independence as one of the terms of the treaty and only in exchange for
          some other consideration.
            There were points at which the interests of 
                  France, Spain
               , and America came into conflict. There Shelburne was ready to foment
          difficulties among the allies, which might lead to a separate peace with each, more favorable to Great
          Britain. The British policy sought to separate America from 
                  France
               , and, by recognizing American independence, bring back conditions in other things as they were in
          1763.
            
            Shelburne believed that 
                  France
                had entered the war to humiliate 
                  England
               , not for American independence. Vergennes would establish a rival power on the other side of the
          Atlantic and then he would quit the war and abandon America. He would balance 
                  England, Spain
               , and the 
                  United States
                against one another. Therefore he would resist the colonial claims to the 
                  Mississippi
               , and leave the country between 
                  Florida
                and the 
                  Ohio
                to the Indians and the country north of the 
                  Ohio
                to 
                  England
                according to the boundaries of the Quebec Act. Nor would he support the colonial claims to the
          New Foundland fisheries.
            
               
                  Spain
                had conquered West 
                  Florida
                and threatened East 
                  Florida
               , and she now claimed that the Floridas reached to the Great Lakes. Gerard, the French agent in
          America, had been influential in obtaining the appointment of the American peace commission. He informed
          Congress that the territories of the 
                  United States
                extended no further west than the limits to which the Royal Proclamation of 1763 permitted
          settlements; that the 
                  United States
                had no right to the navigation of the 
                  Mississippi
               , having no territory adjoining that river; that 
                  Spain
                would probably conquer both Floridas and retain them; that the territory east of the 
                  Mississippi
                belonged to Great Britain, but it would likely be conquered by 
                  Spain
               . He urged Congress to make an alliance with 
                  Spain
               . In 1779 John Jay was sent to Madrid for that purpose.
            Congress then instructed Jay to abandon the claim to navigate the 
                  Mississippi
               , which implied the abandonment of our claim to that river as our western boundary. Independence
          then became our sole remaining claim.
            These conditions and the suspicions toward 
                  France
                acted like controlling facts in the mind of Jay, and only to a little less degree in the mind of
          Adams. Jay disliked the French. He said they "were not a moral people and did not know what it
          was." He had sought an American-Spanish alliance, but the treatment he had received in Madrid and the
          abandonment of the 
                  Mississippi
                boundary by Congress forced on him the conviction that his country was being "used as a
          tool by the European powers and its interests sacrificed for their own. ends."
            
            Adams shared Jay's distrust of the French. He deemed them essentially false and untrustworthy in
          character. Adams told 
                  Franklin
                his feeling and he carried the day with 
                  Franklin
                for a separate negotiation apart from 
                  France
               , communicating as little as possible with Vergennes. 
                  Franklin
                yielded only with great reluctance, but once yielding he gave steady loyalty to his colleagues.
          In the first conference afterwards with Oswald, 
                  Franklin
                turned to Mr. Jay and said: "I am of your opinion and will go on with these gentlemen in
          the business without consulting this court." "He has accordingly," says John Adams,
          "met us in most of our conferences and has gone on with us in entire harmony and unanimity
          throughout."
            Undoubtedly the policy of Adams and Jay, finally supported by 
                  Franklin
               , in negotiating apart from 
                  France
                upset the plans of 
                  France
                and 
                  Spain
                in regard to the American west. The policy of the American commissioners has been fully
          vindicated not only by its immediate results, but by the verdict of history. The defense for it is complete.
            Our commissioners would have Great Britain treat with the 
                  United States
                as an independent people. The French minister thought the concession of independence should be
          made a part of the treaty; it should arise from and not precede the treaty, and therefore we should be
          expected to make some corresponding concession as an offset.
            We claimed the 
                  Mississippi
                as our western boundary. The French minister thought this claim was extravagant. Moreover it was
          against certain views and interests of 
                  Spain
               , which Vergennes was disposed to favor. By the Proclamation of 1763 the lower
            Mississippi Valley was recognized as Indian territory, not subject to colonial
          settlements. Vergennes agreed with 
                  Spain
                that the 
                  United States
                was nowhere in contact with the 
                  Mississippi
               . As far south as the 
                  Ohio
               , the territory, they contended, should be considered a part of 
                  Canada
               , in harmony with the Quebec Act. Vergennes considered the territory south of the 
                  Ohio
                as Indian territory which should be under the joint protectorate of 
                  Spain
                and the 
                  United States
               . Why should we commit the fate of our boundaries to a minister so hostile to our interests as
          Vergennes? 
                  France
                was beholden to 
                  Spain
                and she would pay her at the expense of America. Vergennes would compensate 
                  Spain
                for her failure to obtain 
                  Gibraltar
                by securing her ascendancy on the 
                  Mississippi
               . Jay favored 
                  England
               
                as against 
                  Spain
               , urging 
                  England
               's retention of West 
                  Florida
                and her rights to the navigation of the 
                  Mississippi
               . Such was the conflict in regard to the western boundary.
            We claimed a common right with Englishmen in the New Foundland fisheries. The French minister thought this
          demand too extensive. We claimed that Britain should not insist upon our re-instating the Tories. The French
          minister argued that they ought to be re-instated.
            Was it natural that those who opposed all our claims should be admitted to our confidence if we could
          otherwise negotiate to our advantage? Why not take advantage of 
                  England
               's desire to separate us from 
                  France
                if we could do so without actually violating our obligations? "Our withholding from 
                  France
                knowledge of what we agreed to was no violation of our treaty, and she has no room for complaint
          on that score," said Jay.
            As to the instructions of Congress, we had not yet made a separate peace. And as to acting at every step in
          concurrence with 
                  France
                that demand was founded on a mutual understanding that 
                  France
                would patronize our demands and assist us in obtaining them. 
                  France
               , therefore, by discouraging our claims ceased to be entitled to the degree of Confidence
          respecting them which was specified in the resolution of Congress.
            True, we did depart from the line of conduct marked out by Congress. But Congress marked out that line for
          the sake of America not for the sake of 
                  France
               . The object of the instruction was the supposed interest of America not that of 
                  France
               ; and we were directed to ask the advice of the French minister because it was thought
          advantageous to our country that we should receive it and be governed by it. Only Congress has a right to
          complain of our departure from the line laid out. Such was Jay's argument.
            Jay thought that 
                  France
                would support us only so far as her interest prompted. She was interested in separating us from
          Great Britain, and it was not to the interest of 
                  France
                that we should become a great and formidable people, and, therefore, she would not help us to
          become so. She did not want a British-American treaty that would produce cordiality and mutual confidence
          between the two peoples. Therefore, she sought to plant seeds of jealously, discontent, and discord in  the treaty such as might keep the eyes of America perpetually fixed on 
                  France
                for security. 
                  France
               , therefore, wished to render Britain strong in America and to leave to us as few resources of
          wealth and power as possible. Hence 
                  France
                favored, and would continue to favor, the British demands as to boundaries and Tories. Adams and
          Jay had come to believe that the French ministers desired to keep America in permanent and humiliating
          dependence and that they were not acting fairly toward America. Some of this was unfounded suspicion, but it
          was true that 
                  France
                was trying to reconcile many conflicting interests and that she desired America to make a serious
          sacrifice of her future interest for the sake of other belligerents, especially of 
                  Spain
               .
            At any rate, the American argument for a separate treaty is conclusive. It was to the interest of America, as
          it was her right, to enter into the preliminary treaty without giving 
                  France
                a chance to interfere and thus prevent the good terms which could be and were obtained. Herein
          lies a most interesting fact in these negotiations, that the parties most seriously opposed to one another
          were not the English and the Americans, but the Americans and the French.
            It fell to 
                  Franklin
                to make apologies to Vergennes and the French ministry for what had been done. Vergennes
          complained that the American commissioners had signed the preliminary articles of peace without the knowledge
          of the French ministers. In a confidential dispatch, he directed Lucerne, the French minister in America, to
          inform members of Congress of the conduct of their commissioners in 
                  Paris
               . "I blame no one," he said, "not even Dr. Franklin. He has yielded too
          easily to the bias of his colleagues, who do not pretend to recognize the rules of courtesy in regard to us.
          All their attentions have been taken up by the English whom they have met in 
                  Paris
               . If we may judge of the future from what has passed here under our eyes, we shall be but poorly
          paid for all that we have done for the 
                  United States
                and for securing to them a national existence."
            
               
                  Franklin
                was sincerely anxious to retain both for himself and for his country the good opinion of 
                  France
               . He acknowledged that the American commissioners had been guilty of neglecting a point of bienseéance—that is, of good form. It was only a failure of courtesy,
          the omission of a diplomatic formality  and Franklin insisted that there
          had been no essential bad faith in what they had done. Nothing had been agreed to contrary to the interest of 
                  France
               ; the articles were merely provisional, and no peace could take place between America and 
                  England
                till peace had also been made between 
                  France
                and 
                  England
               . He expressed the deepest gratitude to the French King and he expressed his hope that
          "the great work which has hitherto been so happily conducted, is so nearly brought to perfection, and
          is so glorious to his reign, will not be ruined by a single indiscretion of ours."
            Then 
                  Franklin
                boldly asked for more money from the French treasury for American needs. It is interesting to
          know that he obtained a small loan. Was such clever diplomacy ever excelled?
            
               
                  Franklin
                was called by some a very "cunning man." Shelburne expressed the opinion of him
          that he "wanted to do everything by cunning which was at the bottom of his character." Many
          Englishmen have taken that view of him ever since. He was cunning only in the sense that he knew how to manage
          a cunning man. When talking to a man of candor there was no man more candid than he. It is certain that he was
          astute, if that is what is meant by cunning. Justh Winsor says: "
                  Franklin
                was never anything if not politic. He was certainly never more astute than in yielding to Adams
          and Jay; and he was never more successfully judicious than in disarming the resentment of Vergennes when that
          minister discovered how he had been foiled."
            In mid-summer of 1782, 
                  Franklin
                gave to Oswald the basis of a peace. He named as necessary terms:
            
               Independence, full, complete, and unconditional. All British troops were to be withdrawn from America.
               Settle the boundaries of the States. He assumed their western boundary would be at the 
                     Mississippi
                  .
               Confine the boundary of 
                     Canada
                  , at least to the situation before the Quebec Act.
            
            There was nothing in these essential terms about the Tories, the debts or the fisheries.
            
               
                  Franklin
                then mentioned as advisable articles:
            
               Indemnity to people whose towns and property had been destroyed. He thought $25,000,000 or
            $30,000,000  might be necessary. It was a large sum, but it
            would not be ill-bestowed. It would conciliate the resentment of a multitude of sufferers. Without it they
            would keep up a spirit of secret revenge and animosity for a long time to come against Great Britain. A
            voluntary offer of such reparation would diffuse a universal calm and conciliation over the whole country.
               Some acknowledgement of 
                     England
                  's error in distressing the colonies. "A few words of that kind would do more
            good than people could imagine," he said.
               The ships and trade of the States to have the same priviliges in 
                     England
                   and 
                     Ireland
                   as British ships and trade.
               The cession of 
                     Canada
                   and 
                     Nova Scotia
                   to the States.
            
            As to granting independence by a prior act of Parliament instead of by a clause in the treaty—to
          that Franklin did not attach much importance. Vergennes was aiming to delay the negotiations and continue the
          French-American alliance and the war until 
                  Gibraltar
                could be extorted for 
                  Spain
               , and to obtain an express acknowledgement of Spanish claims to the 
                  Mississippi
                and of the French claims to the fisheries. To this end he held over the Americans the threat of
          refusing further supplies.
            When 
                  Franklin
                joined Adams and Jay in acting independently of 
                  France
               , Vergennes was defeated in this policy. Then, too, the larger proposals of 
                  Franklin
                were relinquished. The Americans soon abandoned their demands for the cession of 
                  Canada
                and 
                  Nova Scotia
                and for the compensation for private property destroyed in the course of the war. The terms of
          the Peace Treaty were quickly arranged, and have now become familiar to American school children:
            
               American independence was recognized.
               The western boundary of the 
                     United States
                   was to be at the 
                     Mississippi
                  ; her northern boundary at the Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence and the line of 45°
            latitude.
               Americans were to have equal rights with the British in the fisheries.
               
               Congress was to recommend that the States make compensation to the Tories (a mere gesture) and that no
            impediment should be placed in the way of the collection of British debts.
            
            As to the southern boundary, if 
                  Spain
                should hold 
                  Florida
                at the conclusion of the final treaties, the 
                  United States
                should reach as far south as the 31° of latitude; but if 
                  England
                were able to retain 
                  Florida
                then that province should reach as far north as 32° 28°. The provision
          relating to the southern boundary was made a secret article of the preliminary agreement with Great Britain.
            
               
                  Franklin
                assented to the secret article with reluctance. The rest of the articles he was happy to sign. He
          hailed the dawn of peace, and he felt that a foundation had been laid for future friendship with his mother
          country and for the future progress of his own. He saw a fair promise that America might soon be both great
          and happy.
            
               
                  Franklin
                had seen a good peace concluded. He was now entering upon his 78th year. In all sincerity he
          repeated the words of the aged Simeon, "Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes
          have seen thy salvation." Public life had absorbed fifty of his years. He begged now to retire. For
          the little time he had left he wished to be his own master. Nearly eight years of busy life and useful public
          service were still before him. He went to the Convention of 1787 and helped to draw up our constitution and
          his voice was one of the most influential in leading to its adoption.
            In 1785 Thomas Jefferson had been appointed to take 
                  Franklin
               's place in 
                  France
               . When asked if he was to replace 
                  Franklin
               , Jefferson replied: "Sir, no one can replace him; I am only his successor."
          When Franklin died in 1790 there was no one to replace him, and I think it may be safely said that we have not
          seen his like since.
         
         
         
            Friendship Church∗
            
            By LENNIE MARTIN BERKEY
            
            As the time approached to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the Church of Christ at 
                  Martinsburg
               , attempts were made to find out as much as possible about the beginnings of the church. The
          oldest church record-book in the possession of the officers begins with the year 1853. On the flyleaf was an
          account, evidently copied from a former book, stating that "The Baptist Church of Jesus Christ at
          Friendship, 
                  Washington County
               , Indiana, was established in 1821 with eleven members…." An explanation of
          how the organization changed into a Church of Christ in 1833 after reaching a membership of thirty-seven was
          also included in the statement from the older record.1
            
            All later entries in the new book related to the Church of Christ at 
                  Martinsburg
               . Was the old Friendship Church located at 
                  Martinsburg
                or was it a nearby country congregation later brought to the village for greater convenience? The 
                  Washington County
                histories do not mention a Friendship Church, and old residents of the community do not even
          remember having heard of such a congregation. Some people advanced the idea that it might possibly have been a
          group meeting at a log schoolhouse on the Coats' farm, about two and one-half miles east, where
          Lemuel Martin once held successful revivals. Many members listed in the 1853 book were from that community.
          John Lovell, an elder in the 
                  Martinsburg
                church, reported to the writer that he was always told that Friendship Church was an old meeting
          house which stood across the road from the site of the present 
                  Martinsburg
                Church of Christ.
            The Rev. Commodore W. Cauble stated in 1930 that the last meeting of the Old Silver Creek Baptist Association
          was held at Friendship, 
                  Washington County
               , in 1837.2 This meeting was an important event in the annals of the Christian
          Church for the Silver Creek Baptist Association, started twenty-five years before, dissolved at this time and
          the name was dropped. Each church included in the Association became 
                  
                     ∗ This paper wm prepared by Mrs. Berkey in 1938 and read before a
              meeting of the 
                        Washington County
                      Historical Society at 
                        Salem
                      an September 30 of that year.
                  
                     1 The page copied from the older record ended with the statement that a new
              book?as being started "to replace our old book which was about filled." The entry is
              dated 1853" and signed by "Aaron Martin, Clerk."
                  
                     2Commodore W. Cauble, Disciples of Christ in Indiana, 30.
               
                a congregation of "Christians only," that is, all of
          them were changed from Baptist into Christian Churches. Although Mr. Cauble had access to the original
          historical document prepared at the Friendship meeting and signed by "A. Littell, Scribe,"
          he could not learn where Friendship Church was located.
            In the spring of 1933, Edna Finley of 
                  Seymour
               , Indiana, inherited three old documents relative to early Baptist churches in this section of
          Indiana. A Friendship Church was mentioned in one of the manuscripts. When inquiry was made concerning the
          location of the Church, Miss Finley was able to furnish the names of delegates sent to an early association
          meeting by the Friendship congregation. As these names were entirely alien to those of the old families in the
          vicinity of 
                  Martinsburg
               , it became clear that the church referred to was probably a Jackson County "Friendship
            Church."3
            
            Early in September 1933, Elder Ben Taylor came to 
                  Martinsburg
                to hold a meeting. He asked anyone knowing a bit of old church history to write it down and hand
          it in at some service. To his surprise he found that there had been three houses of worship at 
                  Martinsburg
                during the century instead of two. The first church had been in the old part of the cemetery and
          some claimed that traces of the old fireplace could still be seen. Odus Weller took Elder Taylor to the 
                  Washington County
                courthouse where a careful searching out and study of the records of old deeds showed that
          Friendship Church was located in 
                  Martinsburg
               . The land on which the old log church once stood in the present cemetery grounds was deeded to
          the Friendship congregation, and the site of the second house, the frame structure which was located across
          the road from the present building, was deeded to the Friendship congregation after it had become a Church of
            Chrirst.4 As the population of 
                  Martinsburg
               , founded in 1818, grew, the church was naturally more easily identified by the name of the town
          than by the earlier name. The name, "
                  Martinsburg
               
               
                  
                     3 The statements are based on correspondence carried on between Miss Finley and
              the writer.
                  
                     4The first of these deeds is recorded in Deed-Book "B", p. 523,
              and the second in Deed-Book "M". p. 34, 
                        Washington County
                      courthouse, 
                        Salem
                     , Indiana. The descriptions found in these deeds are so complete that anyone following the
              measurements given could ascertain the exact sites of the first and second buildings erected. It seems
              strange that the old Friendship Church, which existed for twelve years, should have been completely lost
              sight of by every local historian.
               
                Church of Christ," naturally superseded the old name,
          "Friendship Church."
            In 1833 a strong plea for Christian Unity was voiced by John, Amos, Jacob, and Peter Wright. They organized
          Free Will Baptist Churches in this section of the country and later encouraged them to go into the Reformation
          Movement in which Baptists, Dunkards, New Lights, and other groups were joining. The Wrights hoped that
          denominationalism would cease, but instead a new denomination was created. The 
                  Martinsburg
                Church was known either as the Christian Church or Church of Christ from 1833 to 1897 when there
          was a split over the question of introducing instrumental music and certain organizations into the church. As
          the 
                  Martinsburg
                Church had no organ and no organizations within the congregation except a Sunday School, it was
          decided to stay with the non-progressives and the church was re-organized simply as a Church of Christ.
            Due to the loss of the first record-books of the congregation, the charter members and earliest preachers are
          unknown. In 1853 Absalom Littell (1788-1862), famed as a great religious leader, preached occasionally at the 
                  Martinsburg
                Church. Lemuel Martin, who was reared not far from 
                  Martinsburg
                and whose remains lie buried there, often preached at the church and is remembered as a fiery
          exhorter of the old type. In 1929 Mrs. Kate Hollis of 
                  Oregon
               , widow of a Jackson County Christian minister, wrote of this old worker in the vineyard:
          "Dear old Uncle Lem. Martin, he nearly scared me silly when he came to Driftwood once and gave a
          lecture on Revelation. I never thought time would last as long as it has."
            Jacob Wright and William Frantz, the latter a local member ordained as a minister, also preached there. Asa
          Ferguson, William Coleman, and Logan Martin were Bible School teachers. Archibold Martin and his wife,
          Permelia Denny Martin, charter members of the 
                  Salem
                Christian Church which was founded in 1842, were deacons. Michael Brock, Rev. 
                  Marion
                Brock's father, and the grandfather of the writer, was a deacon for twenty-five
            years.5
            
            
               
                  5 The old record book of the year 1853 is in the possession of John Lovell of 
                     Pekin
                  , Indiana, (R.R. 2). A lengthy history of the church has been partly completed by Elder Ben F.
            Taylor, now of 
                     Bowling Green, Kentucky
                  . This work is & till in manuscript, but is to be typed and bound
            when finished and given to the present congregation. The manuscript may be consulted at the home of another
            elder, Oliver S. Bush of 
                     Pekin
                  , Indiana.
            
            
            The work accomplished by the old Friendship Baptist Church which was founded in 1821 and by the 
                  Martinsburg
                Church of Christ into which it was transformed in 1833, has benefited the community for more than
          a century. The church still lives a monument to the many ministers who have served it, to the pioneers who
          founded it, and to the members who have labored through the long years of change and growth.
         
         
         
            President William A. Jones
            By JOHN DONALDSON
            
            
               His life was brave but mild; In him the elements so mixed That nature herself might stand And point to him
            with conscious pride, And say to all the world, "Behold a man."
               
            
            The first president of the Indiana State Normal School, now the Indiana State Teachers College, was William
          A. Jones. He was born at East Haddam, Middlesex County, 
                  Connecticut
               , on June 17, 1830. He died from pneumonia on his farm near Hastings, 
                  Nebraska
               , on November 13, 1905, at the age of seventy-five, and was buried in a cemetery at Hastings.
          During the time that he lived in 
                  Nebraska
               , he was engaged in agricultural work, except for a period of two years when he was Superintendent
          of the 
                  Nebraska
                Institution for the blind.
            Nature had smiled generously upon President Jones both physically and mentally. He was about six feet tall
          and his body was well proportioned and symmetrical. His head was finely shaped, his countenance was open and
          showed generous impulses, quick perception and strong intellectual powers. He presented a fine personal
          appearance. He never seemed to be in a hurry but was always in perfect poise and self-control. When walking on
          the street, his body was erect, his pace was slow, deliberate, and graceful. His mind seemed to be centered on
          some intricate problem or to be dwelling on some new principles in didactics. He seemed to be entirely
          unconscious of all material surroundings. He looked neither to the right nor to the left. He appeared to be
          completely free from any annoyance caused by the hustle and the bustle of surrounding traffic. If addressed,
          he instantly recalled himself from his pre-occupied attitude and no man of my acquaintance was more genial or
          responsive than was President Jones. Always cordial, and always ready to respond generously to any request or
          to any question presented to him. In his class-room, he was one of the students—in truth he was the
          leading member of the class. There was no frigid atmosphere there. No manifestations of egoism emanated from
          the teacher's desk. Frequently he would sit in his chair, place both hands over his face and while
          we, his students, spellbound, watched and listened to him, he would put out a finger or a thumb, one  after another till all ten digits were pointing outward from the face,
          while at the opening of each finger or thumb an interesting and valuable lesson or principle was revealed to
          the class. A warm studious atmosphere softly glowed in the room and anyone familiar with his leadership can
          easily understand why such a large percentage of those who had the benefit of his training returned later as
          professors to their alma mater. At all times, his voice was low, soft, and so modulated as
          to be distinct and easily understood. His eyes were a very light blue, his complexion fair, his hair graying
          considerably from the somewhat dark, natural color. He was quite particular about his clothing. His outer
          garments were always dark in color, very carefully tailored, and ever in the most tidy condition.
            William A. Jones was a masterful teacher. So highly did I value his instruction that I arranged my studies so
          as to take double the required hours in his psychology classes. In all my experience in the class-room, I
          never saw a student embarrassed. He had a wonderful facility to interest the members of classes beyond my
          ability to describe, and his talent and tact combined to smooth out any problem, however difficult, that arose
          without the least personality arising.
            President Jones had received a classical education at Williston Academy in 
                  Connecticut
               . He had been a teacher in the district schools of 
                  Connecticut
                and had "boarded around." For three years he was secretary and treasurer for a
          manufacturing establishment at the end of which period he was called to the Superintendency of the schools at
              
                  Aurora, Illinois
               . He still held this position when he was chosen as the first president of the
          Indiana State Normal School at 
                  Terre Haute
                in 1870.
            Throughout the administration of President Jones, there were chapel exercises at the opening of every school
          day, different members of the faculty furnishing these programs. All students were required to attend these
          morning exercises. They consisted of musical numbers, announcements, brief lectures by local ministers, and by
          other visitors having some claim to prominence or recognition. In his chapel talks, President Jones strongly
          emphasized the necessity of cleanliness, of orderly and systematic habits and of a definite purpose in all
          activities. It was said by the school gossips that the President's  farm, a few miles north of the city, was not managed in accordance with the views of the sensitive and
          cultured nature of the owner, thus heightening his desire to impress these principles upon the minds of the
          student body. His urge for a definite purpose, for cleanliness, and for systematic methods included all
          features of life, with particular stress upon home and school affairs.
            It may not be inappropriate to mention the fact that it is very difficult for the present generation of
          school children or college students to appreciate the difference between the surrounding conditions of today
          as compared with those back in the seventies and earlier. School buildings, as a rule, in the country, in the
          towns, and in the smaller cities were then very carelessly kept. The day of rock and of concrete surfaced
          roads had not dawned. The public highways then had for their surfacing the natural soil of the locality
          through which the road was constructed or opened. During the wet seasons the soil was carried into the school
          buildings in no small quantities on the shoes of the pupils, thus making the janitor's service, which
          was in many instances performed by some pupil, or by the teacher himself, a difficult task if properly done.
          The tendency was to give the janitor's work the "once over" and accept it as
          satisfactory. It was, and now is, my opinion that students inspired by the principles of President Jones as he
          taught them by going out to teach in the different parts of the state revolutionized the methods of caring for
          the school property wherever they taught, and I am not alone in holding this belief. With President Jones,
          cleanliness was next to Godliness, and strong, fine personality was the goal of life.
            During the summer and fall of 1869, as the building was nearing completion the selection of a president
          became the important duty of the Trustees of the new state school soon to be launched as one of the necessary
          institutions in the educational development of the Hoosier State. It is written in the records that Barnabas
          C. Hobbs,1 one of the leading advocates of the school, visited educators of 
                  Chicago
                in the hope of getting some helpful suggestions in regard to a suitable man for the responsible
          position of head of the Normal School. During this visit, Mr. Hobbs called upon the family of Hiram Hadley.
            
                  
                     1 Mr. Hobbs then held the office of State Superintendent of Public instruction and
              was, ex-officio, a member of the board of trustees of the new institution.
               
                Mr. Hadley was an Indiana man who had moved to 
                  Chicago
               . He had been a prominent citizen in Indiana affairs and was one of the recognized leaders of the
          Church of the Friends or Quakers in the Hoosier State, as was Mr. Hobbs. During this call at the Hadley home,
          the conversation naturally drifted to the purpose for which Mr. Hobbs was visiting in 
                  Chicago
               . Mr. Hadley was so enthusiastic in recommending William A. Jones, Superintendent of the Public
          Schools of 
                  Aurora, Illinois
               , that Mr. Hobbs visited the schools of that city before returning to Indiana.
          Of this visit, I quote from an account given by Professor Howard Sandison in the Normal
          Advance of May 1897.
            
               Having taken measures to provide a suitable building, the Board's quest turned to the more
            important work of securing a president. This quest seems to have been wisely conducted. Through the
            suggestion of Hiram Hadley the Board visited the Public Schools of 
                     Aurora, Illinois
                  . There they found, at
            work as Superintendent, William A. Jones. He was a native of 
                     Connecticut
                   and had received a classical education at Williston Academy. The schools of 
                     Aurora
                   were in such excellent condition and the true educational spirit was so manifestly present that
            the Board concluded to call him to the new and difficult task.
            
            Before entering upon his duties, President Jones sent a communication to the Legislature setting forth the
          nature of the Normal School work, and the needs of the new school. This address was a very able one which did
          much to set the standard for professional work in Indiana.
            Members of the faculty in addition to President Jones during the first six months were: George P. Brown, Miss
          Julia Newell, and Professor R. S. Bosworth.2 After six months service in the new school,
          Mr. Brown retired to accept the superintendency of the 
                  Indianapolis
                schools. From this position he was recalled in 1879 to become the second president of the Normal
          School, following the resignation of President Jones. Miss Newell was a well educated and cultured woman. She
          was selected primarily to deal with the young women of the school, that is, she performed some of the duties
          that now fall to a dean of women and was known as the "Lady Principal." She also taught some
          classes in English. She was one of the party that accompanied Mark Twain on the tour of Europe which led to
          the writing of Innocents Abroad. This 
                  
                     2 The names of Miss Newell and Professor Bosworth never appeared in any catalogue
              of the Normal School. For data relative to them, see Indiana School Journal (1870), XV,
              86, 229, 321.
               
                publicity added to her popularity among the students. She was connected
          with the Normal School a very short time, resigning, it seems, because she felt unprepared to aid in the
          training of teachers, due to lack of teaching experience and Normal School education. Professor Bosworth had
          been a teacher in the "Female College" of 
                  Terre Haute
                which was being transferred to 
                  Greencastle
                and annexed to DePauw. The first catalogue of the Normal School, which was published in 1871,
          does not contain the names of any of the three teachers who were associated with President Jones during the
          winter and spring quarters of 1870.
            The faculty of the second year, 1870-71, which was really the first full year of the Normal School, included:
          President William A. Jones, A.M., Didactics and History; Nathan New-by, Mathematics and Gymnastics; Lewis H.
          Jones, Orthoepy and Reading; Rush Emery, Natural Sciences and Geography; Amanda P. Funnelle, Geography,
          Primary Methods and General Critic; Mary A. Bruce, English Grammar and Composition; William H. Paige, Vocal
          Music and Methods of Teaching the Same; Ruth Morris, Principal of the Intermediate Model School and Critic;
          Sarah Donohue, Principal of the Primary Model School.3
            
            At the end of the year, 1871-72, Professor Emery retired and his place was filled by Josiah T. Scovell.
          Professor New-by likewise left the faculty, to return again after a few years to the same position, and Lewis
          B. Aiken was called to the vacancy. Miss Fannie Scott replaced Miss Donohue of the Model School staff before
          the end of the year 1870-71. At the opening of the year 1872-1873, Cyrus W. Hodgin became Professor of
          history, a newly created position. Michael Seiler who became a member of the faculty remained for two years in
          this period, teaching gymnastics and geography, but was shifted to vocal music for a quarter in 1874 at the
          time of the retirement of Professor Paige.4 Rosa King was added to the teaching corps of
          the Model School.5

                  4Mr. Seiler finished the course in 1873. His long period as professor of President
            came after the retirement of President Jones. During the year 1874-76. Robert 
                     Brown
                  , A.M., served as instructor in vocal music for two quarters, after which the department was
            abandoned for several years. Mr. Brown also served as a pinch-hitter in the department of orthoepy and
            reading between the incumbencies of Lewis H. Jones and Benjamin C. Burt.
               
                  5 Second Catalogue (1871-72), 4.
            
            
            During the last year of the presidency of William A. Jones, 1878-1879, his faculty was made up as follows:
          Mary A. Bruce, English Grammar and Composition; Cyrus W. Hodg-in, History and Geography; Josiah T. Scovell,
          A.M., M.D., Natural Science and Geography; James M. Wilson, Mathematics; Benjamin C. Burt, A.M., Orthoepy,
          Reading, and English Literature; Amanda P. Funnelle, Methods of Primary Teaching; William Wood Parsons,
          Assistant in English Grammar and Composition; Samuel s. Parr, Assistant Instructor. During the year, Professor
          Burt resigned and Joseph Carhart was elected to his place.6
            
            One member of the above group won a world-wide reputation, as the leader of a surveying corps that
          "took the scalp" of Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in 
                  California
               . Dr. Josiah T. Scovell was the first man to achieve the dangerous and extremely difficult
          accomplishment of reaching the top of this towering mountain.
            After leaving the Normal School faculty in 1874, Professor Lewis H. Jones harvested for himself a national,
          or perhaps we should say an international, reputation as superintendent of the 
                  St. Louis
                and later of the 
                  Cleveland
                public schools. These two school systems under his management became known as the best in the 
                  United States
               .
            Under the laws of Indiana, the curriculum of the Normal School necessarily included all the subjects taught
          in the public schools of the state. Early instructors supplemented the text books then in use by dictating
          matter which students copied into lengthy notebooks. Such notes were usually dictated during recitation
          periods. This method was frequently followed by faculty members of later periods. President Jones at first
          depended largely on dictated notes, but soon adopted Porter's Human Intellect as a
          text book. This volume was then regarded as a very exhaustive treatise on psychology.
            Miss Bruce published a pamphlet, English Grammar, which proved very helpful. This pamphlet
          was not commercialized, but students could obtain copies of it from the author at cost. Professor Newby
          prepared a text under the 
                  
                     6Eighth Catalogue (1877-78): Ninth Catalogue
              (1878-79). A careful effort has been made to find the names of all persons who were regularly members of
              the faculty at any time during the presidency of William A. Jones. In addition to those already named as
              teachers in the Model School prior to the summer of 1879, there were four others who taught in the later
              years of the Jones regime: Albert Wyeth, Lida A. Powers, Armada G.Paddock, and Louise Barbour.
               
                title, Number Science, which his classes used in place
          of the current texts in Arithmetic. Professor Newby complimented the writer of this sketch
          by presenting him with a copy of his book. On the fly-leaf of this old text, I find, written in a neat
          feminine hand, the following: 
                  If there should be another flood, For refuge hither fly; For though the world should be deluged, This
              book would still be dry.
                It may be said that Professor Newby's Number Science presented
          mathematical principles requiring more abstract thought than the mass of students at that time were willing to
          devote to any one subject.
            When Professor Lewis H. Jones became a member of the Normal faculty he used The Institute
          Reader as a text-book in Reading and Orthoepy. The compass of this text-book was from the primer to the
          classics, and, "believe it or not," the class of 1875 (when juniors) got the full measure
          from this text-book from "IS it an ox?" to the "Ye call me chief" of
          "Spartacus" and choice passages from Shakespeare. Already some special mention has been made
          of the achievements of Professor Jones, but by way of encouragement to young men and women who are handicapped
          by limited funds, I take this opportunity to write herein what he told me on several occasions, as we
          conversed together. He explained to me that when he started to "do for himself" all his
          worldly possessions consisted of a bundle of clothing tied up in a single red handkerchief and a colt less
          than a year old. It was in the spring of the year and the colt had been so poorly cared for during the winter
          that its shedding hair hung in ragged ribbons almost to the ground. There was a common sympathy between such a
          man and a student like myself. There were no organizations like the Y.M.C.A. or Y.W.C.A. nor any loan funds to
          help ambitious students then as now.
            Professor Lewis Jones was small in stature, with red hair. He was a human magnet and a relentless dynamo. He
          pulled and he drove, but, like President Jones, he created no friction in the class-room. His method of
          teaching reading was something different from the ordinary methods. Each sentence iii the selection taken up
          for study was treated in a way similar to a grammatical analysis, and the full content or meaning of  each word was distinctly sought. A student with good, retentive powers had
          by the time the study was completed, practically memorized each selection without conscious effort. Professor
          Jones gave little or no attention to forms of expression in his teaching. His theory was—Master the
          thought, sentiment or feeling and the form of expression will naturally take care of itself.
            Educational institutions are measured by the accomplishments of their alumni. Just so with all
          administrations and courses of study. Before considering the fundamental principles on which the new State
          School was organized, let us apply the educational yard-stick to the first administration and its course of
          instruction. The statement of results must be under strict limitations, hence I shall call attention to only a
          few of the many worthy students who were graduated from the State Normal School during the presidency of
          William A. Jones. Among them were several who later became prominent members of the faculty of the
          institution. William Wood Parsons, a member of the first graduating class, taught for a brief period in 
                  Indianapolis
               , after which he became a teacher of English Grammar and Composition in the Normal School. From
          1885 to 1921, he served as president. During his long career as head of the institution, he was recognized far
          and wide as a forceful executive. Howard Sandison, also a member of the first graduating class, was for many
          years vice-president and professor of psychology.
            William B. Woods, class of 1877, later became head of the department of Grammar and Composition. Michael
          Seiler, class of 1873, was about a decade later, made head of the Department of Geography. Albert E. Humke,
          class of 1877, became head of the department of Orthoepy and Reading. Students who worked with him could never
          forget his efforts in the field of Orthoepy which he developed into something extensive and exacting. One of
          the principal requirements of the course was to be able to pronounce orthoepy correctly.
          Arnold Tompkins was not graduated under President Jones, though he taught for him during one quarter. One of
          the most brilliant and charming men who ever attended the school, he became professor of Reading and
          Literature in 1891, succeeding Mr. Humke. Professor Tompkins cared little about Orthoepy, his main object
          being to introduce his students to the beautiful  in literature. He was
          deeply interested in what he called the philosophy of teaching. After leaving the Normal School in 1893, he
          studied for a period and then served, successively, as professor of pedagogy at the University of 
                  Illinois
               , as president of Normal University, at Normal, 
                  Illinois
               , and as president of the 
                  Chicago
                Normal School. Oscar Lynn Kelso completed the course at the time of the retirement of President
          Jones in 1879. After a very successful period as principal of the 
                  Richmond
                (Indiana) High School, he became head of the department of Mathematics in the State Normal
          School. Samuel S. Parr, class of 1873, taught temporarily in the Normal School, and later became well known as
          Superintendent of Schools at St. Cloud, 
                  Minnesota
               . William H. Mace, class of 1876, served for many years as professor of American history in 
                  Syracuse
                University. He is one of the very few graduates of the period before 1880 who is still living. He
          spends his winters at Norfolk, 
                  Virginia
               , and his summers at Ganoque, 
                  Ontario
               .7
            
            
               'Tis education forms the common mind, Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined.
            
            With profound reverence we approach this subject, for it was his conception of the teaching process that
          revealed the master-mind and the magnificant handwriting of President William A. Jones on the tablet of time.
          Howard Sandison said of his old teacher in 1908: "The spirit of that great man dominates the school
          to this day, and his spirit is adrift in every nook of the state."
            In a volume of the bound reports of the Normal School, President Jones set forth his convictions in regard to
          the teaching problem: 
                  Scholarship is not the only necessity for teaching. There must be thoroughness in teaching and logical
              organization of subject matter. Successful teaching must be established on the doctrine that there is a
              rational foundation for educational procedure, that it is possible to discover 
                        
                           7 A number of others, who completed the course before the summer of 1879 or
                  who were students during that early period are well worthy of mention. Among these are: Mary O.
                  Andrews (Howard), class of 1873, teacher in Indiana and 
                              California
                           : James W. French, class of 1874, at one time Warden of the prison at 
                              Michigan City
                           : James C. Black, class of 1876, instructor in history for a generation in the Anderson
                  (Indiana) high school: the sisters, Amy E. Wales and Rumana W. Wales, class of 1874, and Cora Hill

                              Israel

                              Virginia
                            and 
                              California
                           : Benjamin A. Ogdon, class of 1875, teacher of English in the 
                              Terre Haute
                            schools for many years: Sanford Keltner, class of 1879, a prominent lawyer of Anderson,
                  Indiana, and at present a member of the board of trustees of the Indiana State Teachers'
                  College, a post which he has held for nearly twenty years.
                     
                      these rationally determined principles, and to train men and women in
              the conscious application of these in all their work of teaching.
               
            
            He declared that there is no short and easy way to the science of teaching. In another of his early reports,
          President Jones wrote: 
                  The opinion still largely prevails that a fair practical knowledge of the legal branches is a sufficient
              qualification to teach. But it is not enough for the teacher to know, even thoroughly, the things he is to
              teach. All science is the product of the mind. The teacher should know the faculties of mind. Each faculty
              may contribute its product. These products should be distinguished from each other that their relationship
              may be known. This knowledge attained, the teacher can determine the order and method by which a subject
              should be presented.
                  There are traditional periods in the growth of mind. Human nature is the same in all ages of the world,
              but not at all ages of the individual. There is a time for sense-perception, for memory and imagination,
              for abstraction and reason as leading forms of mental action. The teacher must recognize these periods so
              as to adapt his instruction to the state of the child's development. Character is more than
              scholarship. There are motives which can be presented to a pupil's mind that will lead him to
              form a character, morally courageous, self-reliant, patient, truthful, kind, considerate, benevolent.
              There are still other motives which can be presented that will lead to the formation of a character,
              proud, selfish, unamiable, deceitful, arrogant. The teacher's work which develops the latter at
              the expense of the former is a sad failure.
               
            
            The following passage concluded the report:
            
               It will be seen that the field of the Normal School is a distinct one; that the field is occupied by no
            other school; that it is the rival of no other school; that its specific function is an important one in the
            school system of the state.8
               
            
            Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt in an article published recently under the title, "The Power of
          Knowledge," asserts an axiom of President Jones in the sentence, "In education the thing
          which counts above everything else is the preparation of the teachers." President W. W. Parsons
          asserted that the expression of President Jones, "The fact in the thing, the law in the mind and the
          method in both," was considered by many modern educators as embodying the first vital rendition of
          the problem of methods in the history of education. "The original thought and spirit of this school
          [Indiana State Normal School] were put into it by the first president and the first faculty and"
          declared President Parsons, "in my mind, no man 
                  
                     8Indiana State Normal School, Report, 1874.
               
                who had ever labored in educational work in Indiana did more to establish
          the work of teaching in Indiana than did William A. Jones."
            President Parsons added: 
                  The school set out to do thorough honest work in whatever it undertook. President Jones and those
              associated with him had no sympathy with any kind of shoddy or superficial work. They believed that school
              work, like everything else, should be honestly and thoroughly done. Superficiality has been the bane of
              school work in this country and particularly so in the training of teachers. This school in its early work
              was the most positive and distinct reaction against this conception that one could possibly conceive. I am
              not sure but that the school went to an unjustifiable extreme in its advocacy and practice of thoroughness
              in its work. It carried the doctrine of thoroughness so far that it transcended the true conception of
              thoroughness and became almost exhaustive.
               
            
            This statement by President Parsons about thoroughness in the Normal School was particularly true in the
          department of methods during the first few years of the school's work, according to the views of the
          students attending at that time. One faculty member (Dr. J. T. Scovell) expressed the general sentiment of the
          students in these words: "Better get something to teach before you try to learn how to teach
          it." The Professor was sincere in this assertion, nor did he mean it as a reflection upon the
          ignorance of the students.
            From President Parson's address of 1910, "Twenty-five Years as President," I take
          the following excerpt relative to the first faculty: 
                  The faculty consisted of a president and two professors which number was increased to five later in the
              year. The State Normal School was most fortunate in its first president and the men and women associated
              with him, who, under his leadership and far-seeing educational vision, pitched the work of the school on a
              sound, philosophic, and educational basis. These people realized the great principle, that education is a
              part of life and that the true theory of all education must rest upon a rational, consistent view of human
              life as to its meaning and abiding aims and ends.
                  To President Jones and his associates, education meant not so much knowledge of English, mathematics,
              science, history, literature, etc. It stood for the inculcation of correct life ideals and principles, for
              spiritual vision and stimulation, and for the formation of correct habits of thought, feeling, volition,
              and action. They believed that public school teachers, above all, should be men and women having correct
              views of life and education, and themselves possessed of worthy ethical character. To this end they
              adopted a sound philosophy of life and education, which they made the basis and foundation of the
              school's first work.
               
            
            
            Vice-president Howard Sandison in an address on the forty-first anniversary of the Normal School said: 
                  The Indiana State Normal School set for itself the following aim: To master the subject as to facts, to
              seek the cleavage idea, and to organize the subject according to the child's development; to
              study the facts of psychology, seek its cleavage idea, and so organize the subject. This thought was
              embodied by President William A. Jones in the expression, "The fact in the thing, the law in the
              mind, and the method in both." Because of this conception, Dr. Harris said that the Indiana State
              Normal School was organized on a higher philosophic plane than any other normal within his knowledge.
               
            
            In all my work as a student in the Normal School, I was vividly impressed with the theory that whatever is
          attempted should be attempted with some definite purpose in view— some specific end to be
          accomplished. The doer should not only have some definite purpose in his doings, but he should carefully study
          the final end or result of his activities. The idea of having a purpose in all activities
          was strictly required in the practice work of the prospective teacher throughout the entire first
          administration of the Normal School.
            It would be impossible to form any accurate estimate as to the work of the first president of the Indiana
          State Normal School without taking into very careful consideration at least some of the handicaps at the
          opening of the school and during its early history. It must be borne in mind that there was only the building
          with such equipment as was absolutely necessary, some of which was very inferior as compared with that of
          today. There was no library and no laboratory facilities. With the construction of the building and the
          purchase of the furniture, the trustees had reached their financial limit. It is said that the finances ran so
          low that they could not build a board fence around the school property and that they spent one entire session
          in discussing the question: "How shall we keep the cows off the school yard?" My memory is
          clear that in my student days the trustees had not yet reached a satisfactory answer to that question.
            It would be difficult to picture the conditions under which the school began its work. There was very little
          popular sympathy for the professional training of teachers. The school began its work in a hostile
          environment. A general sentiment prevailed that, if a teacher desired special training, he should pay for it
          as those in other professions did; that it was unwise  and unfair to
          impose a tax on the citizens for the maintenance of a teachers' training school.
            The incumbency of President Jones, as already stressed, carried with it a high standard of thoroughness. The
          attendance continued to be small. President Jones was, however, unwilling to increase the attendance by
          lowering the standards. On many hands, he was urged to lighten the work and lessen the requirements, at least
          temporarily. Once several individuals of considerable influence when conversing with him upon this subject,
          declared that, if the standards were not changed so as to induce a larger attendance, the Legislature would
          close the doors of the school. The President's reply was that, if the school should be conducted on
          any lower standard, the state ought to close its doors.9
            
            The institution was not closed, and William A. Jones remained in charge until 1879, long enough to leave a
          decided impress on the institution and on the work of the public schools of Indiana.10 The
          Indiana State Normal School, in recent years known as the Indiana State Teachers College, was opened on
          January 6,1870, and will soon pass its sixty-fifth anniversary. Its future is to be determined largely by the
          wisdom of the present and later faculties. Of the life and work of President William A. Jones, we can speak in
          the words of 
                  Milton
               : 
                  Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail Or knock the breast, no weakness, no contempt, Dispraise or
              blame, nothing but well and fair.
               
            
            
               
                  9 By the end of the period of the presidency of Mr. Jones the total enrollment for
            the regular year (September to June) was 225, not a low figure for the late seventies. The number of
            graduates in the first class to complete the course, that of 1872, was 9; in that of 1873, 20. The average
            of the first eight classes was about 15.
               
                  10 Near the beginning of the year 1878-79, President Jones, having been in ill
            health for some time presented his resignation to the board of trustees, which was not accepted. A leave of
            absence was granted to enable Mr, Jones to recover his health (Indiana School Journal,
            Nov., 1878, XXIII, 506). Mr. Jones was absent from his post during most of his last year. Late in the spring
            of 1879. he again tendered his resignation This time the board voted to lay it on the table till the end of
            the year, when a release would be granted, should the President's health not improve (Ibid.. June
            1879, XXIV, 280). Following the close of the academic year, Mr. Jones decided not to withdraw his
            resignation, and it was reluctantly accepted. Very soon after, the board selected George P. Brown.
            Superintend the 
                     Indianapolis
                   schools. as the second president of the Normal School (Ibid., Aug., 1879,
            XXIV, 374). President Brown served as head of the institution until 1885, when he was succeeded by William
            W. Parsons.
               
                  11 The writer of this sketch recently prepared a series of brief articles dealing
            with the Indiana State Normal School in the seventies for the Indiana statement. These
            were published in that weekly, the student journal of the Indiana State Teachers College, during the spring
            quarter of the year 1933-34. The author of this sketch and of the articles that appeared in the Indiana Statesman. John Donaldson. was born on December 23, 1851. Though now completing his
            eighty-third year he is in good health and still an alert man both physically and mentally. He entered the
            Normal in January, 1872, from Eminence. 
                     Morgan County
                  , and was graduated in 1876. For forty-five years. he worked in the 
                     Terre Haute
                   Schools, serving as principal of three different grade schools. He was very active and
            successful. He often lectured in county institutes over Indiana. He retired In 1921, his last position being
            the principalship of the Sandison School which he held for twenty-one years. The public school system of
            Indiana was in it- infancy in 1870. and it is well that Mr. Donaldson who has watched it develop should
            write of the work of so great an educator as William A. Jones.—Editor.
               
            
         
         
         
            Restoration of the Capitol at Corydon
            By CHRISTOPHER B. COLEMAN
            
            Corydon was the center of the stage of Indiana politics and Indiana government during the interlude of twelve
          years between the period when old 
                  Vincennes
                was the capital and the period since the capital was moved to the newly founded 
                  Indianapolis
               . From 1813 to 1825 the political capital of the state was the little hamlet in the hills of 
                  Harrison County
               , a very smáll settlement—a few score houses and a population of a few
          hundred. Corydon has never grown into a large city— it has no through railroad, no large buildings,
          no great factories, and no sensational news to attract attention to it; but in the twelve years when the town
          was the seat of government for territory and state, it became historic.
            The reason why Corydon was made the capital is of some interest and presents some complications. 
                  Vincennes
                at that time was still the most important city in Indiana; but in 1809, when 
                  Illinois
                Territory was formed, 
                  Vincennes
                ceased to be the geographical center of the territory of which it was the capital. It was off to
          one side on the very border line of Indiana. A more central location was desirable. Corydon was not as
          accessible as it might have been, but it was not for from the center of population, being as near as any place
          could be to the halfway mark between the east and west borders, and halfway between the north and south
          borders of the settled area. Citizens of 
                  Brookville,
              Lawrenceburg
               , and 
                  Madison
                on the east side, and 
                  Cannelton, Rockport, Evansville, Vincennes
               , and other settlements on the west could meet at Corydon as
          conveniently as at any other place.
            In addition there was a political reason for the change. Governor Harrison, after the war with Great Britain
          broke out in 1812, was absent from the territory most of the time. He turned his official civil duties over to
          the secretary, John Gibson, who became acting governor. Governor Thomas Posey was appointed as
          Harrison's successor and took his office in 1813. Harrison's adherents were strongest in and
          around 
                  Vincennes
               . There was, moreover, opposition to Harrison, both personal and political. At that time it was
          headed by Jonathan Jennings, from 1807 to the end, a very bitter personal enemy of Harrison. Jennings had
          moved from 
                  Vincennes
               
                to 
                  Clark County
                and had become recognized as the undisputed leader of the citizens of southeastern Indiana,
          opposing the Harrison faction on slavery, admission to statehood, and other issues. Jennings'
          influence would naturally work toward moving the capital from 
                  Vincennes
               . Possibly the cause of 
                  Vincennes
                was weakened by Harrison's withdrawal. At any rate the capital was moved to Corydon.
            It used to be said that Indiana's first statehouse was built in 1811-1812, but investigations
          carried on within the last five or six years, indicate that it was not built so early.1
          The movement for a courthouse at Corydon was begun in 1811, but the ground on which the courthouse was built
          did not pass into the hands of the county until 1812. It seems probable that the building was not begun until
          1812 or thereafter. Eventually the job of building it was given to Dennis Pennington, a prominent citizen of
          Corydon, as undertaker or contractor, and he did most of the construction. It is entirely probable that the
          territorial legislature never sat in the old courthouse. It was begun and built as the 
                  Harrison County
                courthouse, but it was understood that it would be used as a statehouse when the capital should
          be moved to Corydon. Certainly, the legislature, beginning in 1816, met in this 
                  Harrison County
                courthouse, which became Indiana's first state capitol.
            The building was not entirely finished until 1821, for there is an entry in the county
          commissioners' records of that year to the effect that a committee was appointed to see whether the
          contract had been carried out satisfactorily. The committee reported adversely, there being some matters that
          needed to be changed. Apparently that was done, as there was no other entry made.
            After the state government was transferred to 
                  Indianapolis
                in 1825, this building was used as the courthouse of 
                  Harrison County
                for three generations or more. During that time many changes were made and in 1873 there was a
          general remodeling and extensive reconstruction of the building. With the quickening of historical interest in
          Indiana, especially in connection with the state centennial, a movement was started 
                  
                     1 A fuller and more detailed account of many of the matters discussed here is
              given in George S. Cottman's The Corydon State House, Publication No. 94 of the
              Department of Conservation (
                        Indianapolis
                     ). The matter now presented first formed a portion of a paper. entitled "Two
              Restorations: The First State Capitol and the First State Constitution", which the author read at
              a meeting of the Southwestern Indiana Historical Society at 
                        Evansville
                     , March 17, 1933.
               
                to have the state buy the building and preserve it as a memorial of
          territorial days and early statehood. In 1917 the General Assembly passed a bill making an appropriation for
          the purchase of the building. While the state then acquired title to it, it was used as the courthouse of 
                  Harrison County
                for some ten years longer. Finally in 1925 the custody and care of the various historical
          memorials was entrusted by an act of the General Assembly to the Department of Conservation. It was not until
          1929, however, that a small appropriation was made for the restoration of the old State Capitol at Corydon to
          its original condition.
            The maintenance of places and buildings as nearly as possible in the condition in which they existed when of
          historical importance and their restoration when conditions demand it, are interesting and important fields of
          historical work. They are of interest, not only to architects and people who deal with buildings, but to
          anyone who likes problems and their solution. The solution of problems always makes a peculiar appeal.
            One of the first problems was to find out what the building had looked like in 1816 before changes should be
          made. One of the first questions arose in connection with the material used for the floor. One old resident
          was sure it had been covered with tan bark; others maintained that it was made of flagstones. An investigation
          was necessary, so, in 1929 workmen were employed to rip up the wooden floor. They found dirt just beneath the
          wooden floor, but it was not trampled down as it would have been if used as a floor and there was no sign of
          tanbark. They dug down about two feet and found flagstones. That worked in well with another find, namely,
          that the level of the ground around the old building had been raised. There was no drainage or sewage system
          in Corydon when the building was erected and the floor level was practically the same as the ground level.
          When the street level had been raised for purposes of better drainage, water was thrown down into the
          courthouse grounds. Then the ground around the courthouse had been filled to a level which would prevent water
          from standing about the building. That necessitated raising the floor level, so the flagstone floor had been
          covered with dirt and a board floor laid above.
            The solution of the first problem threw light on others. The architect of the restoration had commented on
          the fact  that the width of the fireplace was out of all proportion to its
          height. When the original floor level was found and the dirt fill taken out, the height of the fireplace was
          correspondingly increased and resumed its correct proportions. The Department of Conservation was persistent
          enough, and lucky enough, to find the original mantel which fitted the fireplace perfectly.
            It was very apparent, also, that the size of the windows on the first floor had been changed at some time,
          and the windows widened. When the outside and inside levels were restored, it was found that the windows had
          been shortened, that is filled in at the bottom with stone which matched the rest of the building, and widened
          to give the necessary amount of light.
            Next it was discovered that the door was out of proportion and the outline of the original door was
          ascertained. When the Department of Conservation began its work there was simply a plain opening for the door,
          but there was no transom. The opening showed changes in masonry. It was found that a resident of 
                  Brownstown
               , Jackson County, had the original fan or transom which had been taken out in 1873, and she now
          presented it to the state. The rest of the door was made to match and it was thus restored to its appearance
          of 1816. A description of the courthouse, written before it was remodeled in 1873, confirmed the correctness
          of the restoration.
            No description and no illustration of the building before 1873 made certain exactly what the cupola was like.
          For that, the Department of Conservation fell back upon the expedient of copying the cupola of a courthouse in 
                  Ohio
                built about the same time as the one at Corydon. There can be no perfect restoration of any old
          building that has been destroyed or that has been remodeled, because there are details that escape every
          observer; but as nearly as can be, the old statehouse at Corydon, Indiana, by painstaking and intelligent
          historical research, has been rebuilt so that anyone can go there today and see it substantially as it was
          when the first session of the state legislature met in 1816.
         
         
         
            Up From Dixie
            By JAMES L. SMALL
            
            In a disused shed on some LaPorte county farm there might, perhaps, be found today a rusty, homemade iron
          poker with a rudely fashioned hook at one end, used in pioneer days to stir up the smoldering embers in the
          open fireplace of an Indiana homestead. Were it to be discovered, it would be treasured by members of the
          Small family, for it would serve as the last link connecting their lives with the Dixie from which their
          people came over a hundred years ago—as symbolic, in its way, as the plow in The
            Covered Wagon. That poker was well remembered by the late O. L. Small, who told the writer about it and
          of how it was wrought from a fragment of the wagon which conveyed the family from their home in the South to
          their newer one above the 
                  Ohio
                river.
            Little is known concerning the origin of the Smalls.1 It is probable that the first
          members of the American branch of the family came from 
                  England
                (or possibly from 
                  Scotland
               ) in colonial times. In the early days of the nineteenth century, George Small, with his wife and
          family, in company with some of their neighbors, sold out and left their homes in 
                  North Carolina
               . Those homes were located in the northeastern part of 
                  North Carolina
                in 
                  Pasquotank County
               .2 In the case of the Smalls there is a well established tradition that one of
          their principal reasons for migrating was a conscientious objection to slaveholding.
            The emigrants made their toilsome way northward and westward, crossed the 
                  Ohio
                and took up land on the spot where the flourishing city of 
                  Richmond
               , Indiana, stands today. Later 
                  
                     1 This brief treatment of the Small family is a revision of the account which was
              published in 1928 as a small pamphlet of ten pages. The writer is the son of James Forester Small and
              Susanna Pratt Small. My father was a brother of the O. L. Small ("Uncle Dick" Small)
              mentioned in the paper. Moot of this information presented. was gathered from my Uncle O. L. Small when I
              visited him in his Indiana home for the last time in June, 1925. He was born in 1844 and died in 1928. His
              wife Alice Gardner Small wan born in 1847 and died in 1925. The mother of O. L. Small was a pious
              Methodist. who named him after two divines of that faith whom she respected highly. Since one was the Rev. 
                        Orange
                      and the other the Rev. Lemon, the boy was christened 
                        Orange
                      Lemon Small. He disliked the name so much that he refused to use more than the initials, and
              chose for himself the name "Dick". Very few ever knew what the initials
              "0" and "L" stood for.
                  
                     2 It was the tradition in both the Small and Osborn familes until recently that
              the family of George Small migrated to Indiana from some part of 
                        South Carolina
                      near the 
                        North Carolina
                      border. This tradition was embodied in my pamphlet of 1928. It was Mr. B. F. Osborn of
              Rippey, 
                        Iowa
                     , whose investigations established the fact that the Small family lived in 
                        Pasquotank County, North
              Carolina
                     . The U. S. census of 1790, shows the Small family as residing there and not
              in 
                        South Carolina
                     . Mr. B. F Osborn is a grandson of Rachel Small Osborn, daughter of John Small and
              grand-daughter of George Small.
               
                they moved to 
                  Waynetown
               , near 
                  Crawfordsville
               . Before the removal to 
                  Waynetown
               , however, John, son of George Small, met, courted and married Mary Lennington, whose people
          (Pennsylvanians) had descended the Allegheny and 
                  Ohio
                rivers on flatboats, settling first in 
                  Clark County
               , Indiana, and then near the Smalls on the site of the present 
                  Richmond
               .
            John and Mary Lennington Small did not go with the rest of their relatives to 
                  Waynetown
               , but with their growing family of little children set out for the extreme northern part of the
          state, where, on the shore of Lake 
                  Michigan
               , a village was beginning to take shape, now the municipality of 
                  Michigan City
               . Here one Col. Elston was platting streets and building lots and John Small helped him in the
          work. That was about 1832 or 1833. In 1835 the young couple, both of whom had come from a race of farmers,
          decided to take up land. They bought from a squatter (afterwards obtaining title from the government) a tract
          of 120 acres in 
                  Clinton
                township, three miles south of Westville. There the family of eleven children, some of whom were
          born after removal to this farm, grew up and there on October 28, 1851, John Small died of typhoid fever, with
          the ravages of which the folk of that day were only too familiar.
            Meanwhile Phineas, John Small's brother, had been with him on the farm. He married Mary Pinney,
          whose parents had moved to Indiana from 
                  Virginia
               . After John's death the old home place was purchased by this brother and it is today in
          the possession of Eudorus ("Dode") Reynolds, a grandson of Phineas and Mary Pinney Small.
            Names and dates are only useful as sign-posts. The interesting scene, the colorful
          incident—everything, in short, that has to do with the places where those we love and from whom we
          are descended have lived and died—must be limned for us by one who knows. Such a one was O. L.
          Small, ninth child of John and Mary Lennington Small. One of his sisters died a few months before his father,
          another a few months after. Most of those that remained wandered far afield. The mother died on March 27,1874,
          in Girard, 
                  Kansas
               , whence several of her children had removed. Two of the brothers died in 
                  Illinois
               , one in Indiana, one in 
                  Texas
               , one in 
                  California
                and one in 
                  New Orleans
               . A sister died in 
                  Nebraska
                and another sister in 
                  Colorado
               . When, on September 12, 1928, "Uncle Dick" (0. L. Small) breathed his last, he
          had been for more than three  years the sole survivor of his generation.
          Save for several business and pleasure trips that had taken him to the far west and on one occasion to Europe,
          his entire life had been spent within a short distance of his birthplace.
            Very few indeed of the Smalls have become wealthy or distinguished. Most of us are still "to fortune
          and to fame unknown." But whether prosperous or otherwise we have liked to turn back to Uncle Dick
          and Aunt Alice (Alice Gardner Small, the lovable and remarkable woman to whom he was married in 1865 and who
          preceded him in death by five years). We knew that they were waiting for us with the word of welcome and the
          smile of cheer. Surrounded by his children, grand-children and great grand-children, Uncle Dick was a
          patriarch, lacking the patriarch's suggestion of extreme age. To hear him recount the events of a
          time sixty or seventy years earlier was to have painted for one a picture of northern Indiana, and especially
          of LaPorte county, beginnings.
            A good deal of this reminiscence quite naturally clustered around the old Small place, now occupied, as has
          already been noted, by a grand-nephew of John Small. Ninety years is a long time and about all there is left
          on the original farm to identify it with the past are three giant burr-oaks. They must be all of one hundred
          fifty years old, for they were already of ample size when Dick Small and his brothers, as barefoot boys, used
          to bask in their welcome shade. The old log cabin home, eventually became a smokehouse and was succeeded by a
          good sized frame house, which, in its turn, gave place to another dwelling. The second house was moved to
          Westville, where for some time it was occupied by the local paper, the Westville Indicator.
          O. L. Small was the first and his son, Edmund Gardner Small, the last of the family to be born in that
          building.
            The Indian mounds on the Reynolds farm, once of considerable size, can scarcely be traced now. Down in a
          remote corner there might have been found, as late as the summer of 1925, a few plants of the old fashioned
          tansy. In all probability they were descendants of seed sown by "Uncle Andy" and
          "Aunt Margaret." O. L. Small was the last one left who had known this quaint negro couple.
          "Aunt Margaret," he said in his quiet, humorous way, "used to spank us, just like
          Mother". The negroes had their own little cabin on the Small place. How  they came to Indiana is a matter of conjecture. Later on "Uncle
          Andy" went south with a trader, and as he never returned the belief arose that he had been sold into
          slavery. His wife went to 
                  Liberia
                with some missionaries to work among her race. Today, beyond a doubt, the bones of good old
          "Aunt Margaret" are resting in a grave somewhere in Africa.
            Interesting also was Uncle Dick's description of the prairie's fertility in those early
          days. There was almost no clearing to be done and the soil that the pioneer's plow turned up was rich
          and virgin. Nor was social life without its amenities. The settlers were ambitious for their children and, so
          we were informed by Uncle Dick that his brother, Abram Lennington Small, eldest son in the family and known in
          later years as "DOC" or "Uncle DOC", was Westville's first school
          teacher. His son, Len Small has twice served as governor of 
                  Illinois
               .
            John Small's sister, Rachel, married Jonathan Osborn, a relationship that is perpetuated in the
          Small-Osborn reunions, held annually. Jane Lennington, sister of Mary Lennington Small, married Jonathan
          Williams. The Williamses were Quakers and even in his last years Uncle Dick was wont to smile at the
          recollections of his boyhood visits at "Quakerdom", as the settlement was called, and of his
          attendance at "
                  Quaker
                meeting". His younger brother Will used to recall the greeting of Uncle Jonathan
          Williams: "Make thyself at home, Willie. Thou art in thy uncle's house."
            And so these tender memories come to us from out the past. The writer would have much preferred that someone
          more competent than he undertake the task of setting them down. But no one offered. So he has fashioned as
          best he could, and in the fashioning he has been made happy."

            A Glasburn Family Tradition Authenticated
            By OMA GLASBURN ROBINSON
            
            At the age of three, David Glasburn, who was born in 1831 in 
                  Covington, Virginia
               , rode on horseback in
          front of his mother, Mary Persinger Glasburn, all the way from 
                  Virginia
                to Indiana. His only impression in after years was that of a very long and tiresome journey on a
          wilderness road. His father, Frederick, who was most anxious to have a good home for his family as soon as
          possible, died from overwork seven years after settling on a farm in 
                  Johnson County
               , Indiana, leaving David at the age of ten without a father.
            As David grew up, he was especially proud of the fact that his family had always stood by the country in
          times of need; that representatives of the family had taken an active part in all its wars. He himself had
          participated in the Civil War. His older brother, Samuel, had fought in the Mexican War. Three of his uncles,
          George, Samuel, and Peter, had taken part in the War of 1812. Samuel had enlisted twice, and Peter had been
          killed in action.
            But David Glasburn was proudest of the record of his grandfather, David Glasburn, whose name he bore. Knowing
          this intense interest of his, I often read my history lesson (especially when it happened to concern the
          Colonial Days and the Revolution) aloud to my father before the fireplace at our home, and he said to me again
          and again: "My grandfather took part in all those wars."
            At that time, I, too, was filled with happiness and with pride to think that my people had always done their
          bit. I was content with the accounts as received, little realizing then the value of exact records of
          incidents in connection with people and historic places. It did not occur to me to ask the few simple
          questions which would have given me, in all probability, all the information that I later so greatly desired.
          As a result, I am at present painstakingly searching for the exact records of my great-grandfather who
          "took part in all those battles."
            As near as I can ascertain, David Glasburn came from the Rhineland in 
                  Germany
                and settled in 
                  Virginia
                about 1760. Following 1766,I find occasional mention of him in the records of Augusta and
          Botetourt counties. From casual remarks by  my father concerning his
          grandfather's activities, I was quite sure that he had taken part in the Battle of Point Pleasant
          which occurred October 10, 1774, on the banks of the Great Kanawha River. This was the most important battle
          in Lord Dunmore's War, but a careful search of all records failed to reveal the name of David
          Glasburn.
            I was especially hopeful that it might be found in the Documentary History of Dunmore's
            War, edited by Reuben Gold Thwaites and Louise Phelps Kellogg. This is a volume which was
          "compiled from the Draper Manuscripts in the Library of the 
                  Wisconsin State
                Historical Society." After a careful perusal of all names in the various companies, I
          failed to find the name I sought.
            However, on page 419, I came across a list of men that held my interest. Their names had been taken from the
          Draper Mss. (collection number 22235). It was a page from Ensign Newell's notebook, written on
          October 23, 1774, thirteen days after the battle. The notebook was in Newell's handwriting and
          contained a list of those wounded in the battle, he himself being one of them. The account mentioned three in
          Captain Shelby's company, two in Captain Russell's company, and one in Captain
          Campbell's company.
            Then came the list of wounded in Captain Arbuckle's compaxy, including the following names, as
          printed in the Thwaites-Kellogg volume (followed by others not here reproduced):
            
               John McMullin
               David Glascum
               John Freeland
               William Morris.
            
            As I carefully studied these names, it dawned on me that the David Glascum could be the David Glasburn for whose name I was searching, as he was in Captain Arbuckle's
          company. The Captain's farm was just above Glasburn's farm on the North side of the
            James River. It was of Thomas Carpenter that, a few years later, David Glasburn, my
          great grandfather, had bought a farm on "the South Side of the James for 100 pounds." In
          fact, all the men mentioned in the lists had become familiar to me through a study of the early records of the 
                  Virginia
                counties, Augusta and Botetourt, when searching for information relative to David Glasburn.
            
            In all my study, I had never come across the name Glascum that I could recall. To check
          this, I again went over the early census records of 
                  Virginia
               , and, in fact, the indices of all books pertaining to the early history, and the name Glascum was not to be found. I became more certain all the time that the name Glascum should be Glasburn.
            
            I wrote the 
                  Wisconsin State
                Historical Society at 
                  Madison
               , where the original manuscript from which the names had been taken by Thwaites and Kellogg is
          carefully preserved. Fortunately, my letter reached Miss Annie A. Nunns, who is Assistant Superintendent of
          the 
                  Wisconsin State
                Historical Society and to whom reference is made in the introduction to the Documentary History of Dunmore's War.
            
            At first, I was informed by Miss Nunns, in regard to the original document, that "the
          ‘c’ in Glascum is a large, old-fashioned capital ‘c’ that might
          easily be mistaken for a ‘b’, particularly when it occurs in the middle of a
          word." However, she gladly offered to furnish me with a photostatic copy of the manuscript. I sent
          for it immediately, but before I received it, a second letter came from Miss Nunns that was most gratifying.
          She said in part: 
                  I am mailing you the photostat today, and I am positive you are right in your identification of
              ‘Glasburn’. I had not examined the manuscript personally before, but when I did, and
              went over it with the Head of the Manuscript Department, she says that she was quite mistaken in thinking
              the letter to be ‘c’. Sorry that our mistake, first made in Dunmore's War, and later repeated, should have misled anyone, even for a short time.
               
            
            When the photostat arrived, it proved conclusively both that the later identification by Miss Nunns and my
          inference were correct. The supposed name David Glascum actually was David
            Glasburn.
            
            David Glasburn
            In The History of the Battle of Point Pleasant by Virgil A. Lewis, the above mentioned
          mistake is not only incorporated, but is even more misleading. On page 51, in giving the list of wounded, he
          spelled the name David Glascom instead of David Glascum as in Dunmore's War.
            
            
            I am especially pleased that this mistake has been found, for it is definite proof that my father's
          story was correct. His grandfather (my great-grandfather), David Glasburn, had fought in the Battle of Point
          Pleasant, as is fully attested by the fact that his name was on Ensign Newell's list of the wounded,
          which list was prepared thirteen days after the most important battle of Lord Dunmore's War.

            MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS
            By MILDRED C. STOLER
            
            The William Henry Smith Memorial Library of the Indiana Historical Society has several interesting manuscript
          collections. William Henry Smith, in whose honor the library was named by his son, Delavan Smith, the donor,
          was an 
                  Ohio
                journalist. His keen interest in history led him to publish The St. Clair
          Papers (2 v., 
                  Cincinnati
               , 1882) and to begin a life of President Rutherford B. Hayes. The chapters which he had completed
          before his death were published afterwards under the title A Political History of Slavery (2
          v., 
                  New York
               , 1903). In the preparation of these works he had transcripts made of original manuscripts and
          these copies are now in the Smith Library which is located in the new Indiana State Library and Historical
          Building.
            Among the transcripts are the papers of General Arthur St. Clair, officer in the American Revolution and
          governor of the Northwest Territory (1788-1802); the greater part of the originals are in the 
                  Ohio State
                Library. The period covered extends from 1771 to 1819. This group also includes a copy of the
          major portion of the Executive Journal of the Northwest Territory from 1788 to 1795 as it was transmitted to
          the Secretary of State by the territorial secretary. This may be a transcript of the copy in the State
          Department. A printed index to the names of the correspondents of St. Clair serves as a guide to the contents
          of these papers. Among them are many documents which were not published by Mr. Smith.
            Mr. Smith also had copies made of a number of manuscripts in the British Museum. Although the Library of
          Congress now has photostatic reproductions of these letters, students of this state may desire to make a
          preliminary examination in 
                  Indianapolis
               . This group contains the correspondence of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Bouquet (1756-1765) while he
          was stationed at 
                  Charlestown, South
              Carolina
               , and at Fort Pitt, and also the letters which passed between the
          Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 
                  London
                and the British Ministers to the 
                  United States
                Robert Liston (also Edward Thornton, who acted as chargé
            d'affaires in Liston's absence), 1797-1803, and Anthony Merry, Liston's
          successor, 1756-1765. There  are also copies of the reports sent by
          British consuls at 
                  Boston, New
              York, Philadelphia
               , and Norfolk to the Foreign
          Office (1802-1805). A part of these have been published in various places.
            The personal correspondence of William Henry Smith is not yet ready for use. However, eleven autograph
          letters of John Sherman to Smith (1879-1880) and twenty-one letters written by James A. Garfield to 
                  Rutherford
                B. Hayes (1880-1881) have been calendared. They deal with the political campaign of 1880. The
          latter group shows the friendly relationship existing between President Hayes and President-elect Garfield.
            A letter written in 1814 by William Henry Harrison to Isaac 
                  Shelby
               , governor of 
                  Kentucky
               , mentioning a "brilliant little affair on the Thames," and one sent to Harrison
          by Lewis Cass in 1815, commenting on the dark outlook for the Americana in the war with 
                  England
               , are also in the collection.
            The Smith Library has recently acquired a collection of one hundred two letters and documents which give a
          many-sided picture of the life of the Legion at and near Greenville, 
                  Ohio
               , during the years 1794 to 1796. It has seemed appropriate to name the collection for the famous
          commander-in-chief of the Legion, Anthony 
                  Wayne
               . Also, there are scattering documents for the years 1797 to 1809. Duels and dances, whisky and
            ketchup,1 garden-making in the spring, and negotiation of treaties with the Indians
          flash before the reader of these yellowed papers.
            The Indiana Historical Society also owns and is now making accessible in the Smith Library a part of the
          collection of William H. English, author of Conquest of the Country North-west of the River 
                     Ohio
                  , 1778-1783 (2 v., 
                  Indianapolis
               , 1896). The writer of this volume was a member of Congress from Indiana for many years and author
          of the "English Bill," a compromise measure passed during the struggle for the admission of 
                  Kansas
               . One valuable item which supplements the 
                  Wayne
                Collection is an orderly book of Brigadier General Robert Todd of the 
                  Kentucky
                Volunteers who marched to the aid of General 
                  Wayne
                in the fall of 1793. The book also contains the diary kept by Todd while he accompanied 
                  Wayne
                on the campaign against the Indians in 1794. His laconic comment 
                  
                     1 Probably walnut ketchup.
               
                on the Battle of the Fallen Timbers, however, is far from satisfying to
          one desiring detailed descriptions.
            There are also thirty-five letters (1808-1840) to Dr. David G. Mitchell by such prominent men of the period
          as Ratliff Boon, Isaac Coe, William Hendricks, Dennis Penning-ton, and Andrew Wylie. Dr. Mitchell's
          varied interests are apparent in the letters which concern such topics as health, medical societies, politics,
          and the hiring of professors at Indiana University.
            Among the personal papers of William H. English are forty-five letters from Jesse D. Bright, senator from
          Indiana from 1845 until 1862, when he was expelled because of a letter written to President Jefferson Davis.
          The letters, written during the years from 1842 to 1863, freely discuss political questions, Bright's
          political friends and enemies, his own views on the slavery controversy, and the forces which ended his
          senatorial career and permitted the election of David Turpie as his successor. The English papers include much
          correspondence dealing with politics from 1842 to 1892, but for the years 1854-1858, when the 
                  Kansas
                question almost disrupted the Democratic Party in Indiana, and 1879-1880, when Mr. English was
          the Democratic nominee for Vice president, the letters are especially fruitful for the historian. Among the
          correspondents of Mr. English during the earlier period was Judge William W. Wick of 
                  Indianapolis
                who sent his friend twenty-five letters giving him information concerning the political fences at
          home and advice as to the best method of keeping them repaired.
            The Niblack Collection was given to the Society by Mrs. Albert P. Niblack. It consists of commissions and
          certificates of election to Congress of William E. Niblack (1843-1882) and of the commissions of Albert P.
          Niblack who reached the rank of vice-admiral before his retirement from the Navy in 1923. There are also the
          orders received by him from the Navy Department for the period of his service, 1880-1923.
         
         
         
            History Teachers'
            Forum THE NEW CHALLENGE TO THE SOCIAL STUDIES∗
            
            By RUSSELL T. MCNUTT
            
            It is generally acknowledged that recent economic and social changes have numerous and significant
          implications for education, and particularly for that field of education embracing the social studies. The
          case may be stated somewhat in the following manner.
            The nineteenth century and the opening decades of the twentieth century were marked by tremendous advances in
          the physical sciences and their application. Goods and services were produced with amazing speed. New
          enterprises almost without number sprang into being. A magnificant edifice of credit was erected. For a time
          there seemed to be no limit to the number of new recruits that could be used in this conquest and enslavement
          of the forces of the material world. Inanimate power assumed the major portion of the world's work,
          displacing the physical drudgery of men, but still it seemed that more jobs were created than were destroyed.
            Why then, with all this efficiency, are we in the mess in which we find ourselves today? A complete answer to
          this question cannot be given in a brief space, but the essential facts may be summed up as follows: social,
          economic and political machinery was not being developed at anything like the speed with which new forces were
          being developed and put to work by the physical sciences. The inevitable result was collapse.
            Wherein is the challenge to the social studies? It is often held that, if education functioned properly,
          technological advancement and the necessary social and economic adjustments would not be allowed to proceed at
          such widely divergent rates. Is it reasonable to blame education for not preventing economic breakdown? If so,
          a large share of the responsibility must be borne by teachers and writers in the field of the social studies.
            Regardless of whether we have been at fault, the present disorder opens up a number of questions that must be
          considered by social studies teachers. What is the proper relation between 
                  
                     ∗ As here published, this paper is a somewhat curtailed reproduction of
              a paper which the author prepared to read before the Social Studies Section of the Indiana State
              Teachers' Association, meeting in 
                        Indianapolis
                      on Thursday, Oct. 18, 1984.
               
                our subject and the changes that are made in social and economic theory
          and organization? Should we be content merely to trace the development of present institutions and practices,
          or should we attempt to point the way to a new social order? If we are to build for the future, who shall
          determine the direction of our efforts?
            Any attempt to lay the foundation for social and economic institutions adequate for present and future needs
          would inevitably meet with determined opposition from privileged groups and from the self-appointed guardians
          of the established order. As Professor Overstreet points out, any thoroughgoing reforms would most certainly
          be opposed by chambers of commerce, the military legions, and the sons and daughters of this, that and the
          other. We need these conservative influences, of course, to hold in check the forces of radicalism, but, if we
          are to have any genuine progress, we dare not intrust the destinies of our society solely to their hands.
            Some will say that we need not have as an objective any particular type of social order. It is our task to
          present the facts and let the facts speak for themselves. This ideal may be approached in advanced college
          classes, and particularly in history courses, but even here one must face the question of what facts to
          present and with what emphasis. Fortunately the decision in respect to what to teach in the college is, with,
          in rather broad limits, left to the instructors. This is not to say that college teachers always enjoy
          complete intellectual freedom or that positions are not sometimes sacrificed because of
          "liberal" ideas, but in the high school the teacher is much more subject to the powers that
          be.
            Furthermore, if we are to teach only undisputed facts, are we to rule out planning and experimentation? These
          have been the basis for our phenomenal advance in the physical sciences. Should they not be applied to social
          problems?
            What we need in America is not a new and radical "ism." We need first to analyze the
          institutions under which we have lived and prospered in the past, and then to adjust these institutions to our
          new conditions. We must be willing to face unpleasant facts and accept some changes that we would prefer to
          avoid. Thus, however much one may deplore the passing of the era of laissez faire economy,
          the fact remains  that this system cannot function under modern
          conditions. Some form of regulation is inevitable. If we are reasonable, we may be able to solve the problem
          and yet preserve many of the benefits of the old system. If we insist on being unreasonable, the answer must
          be some sort of dictatorial control as the only alternative of chaos.
            As teachers of social studies, we do not want a program of instruction dictated by the government or by
          special groups. We want to be able to explore at will all the aspects of any problem and to examine
          objectively any suggested program of action. A detailed scheme of social studies instruction to be followed by
          all teachers of the subject everywhere, even though it be evolved by teachers themselves, would be
          undesirable, but, with the aid of specialists in our field, we should be able to lay down a few broad general
          principles upon which we could safely build.
            If we are to meet the challenge of training for life in the emerging social order, we must first become
          social philosophers. In the words of Professor Mahoney, of 
                  Boston
                University, we must examine our "way of life to discover its highlights and its shadows,
          its idiosyncrasies and ineptitudes, its nature and its needs."1
            
            Here is the answer of Professor Charles A. Ellwood to the question before us: 
                  At least one-third of every student's time should be devoted to the social studies from the
              kindergarten to the end of the A.B. course. Only thus can the social, political, and economic ignorance
              which now beclouds the minds of our people be dissipated… If we are going to have social
              education we must educate the emotions as well as the intelligence. It is idle to suppose that
              intelligence alone can solve our social problems as long as we continue to cultivate ignoble and
              antisocial emotions. The whole man needs to be socialized if our schools are to produce the genuinely good
              citizen. Social imagination and social sympathy must be cultivated if social information is to be rightly
                apprehended2
                  
               
            
            A commission of the American Historical Association is working on the Social Studies in the Schools. The
          Report of this Commission will run to sixteen volumes when the whole is completed and published. The first
          volume, A Charter for the Social Studies in. the Schools came from the press in 1931.

                The final volume, entitled Conclusions and Recommendations
            of the Commission was recently published. From the section of this volume, "Educational
          Philosophy for the 
                  United States
               ," the following is quoted:
            
               Whatever may be the exact character of life in the society now emerging, it will certainly be different in
            important respects from that of the past. It will be accompanied by many unaccustomed restraints and
            liberties, responsibilities and opportunities; and whether it will he better or worse will depend in large
            measure upon the standards of appraisal applied, the particular choices now made within the limits of the
            possible, and the education of the rising generation in knowledge, thought, and appreciation of its
            necessities and potentialities.
               In two respects education will be challenged: (a) the emerging economy will involve the placing of
            restraints on individual enterprise, propensities, and acquisitive egoism in agriculture, industry, and
            labor and generally on the conception, ownership, management, and use of property, as the changing policies
            of government already indicate; and (b) the emerging economy, by the reduction of hours of labor and other
            measures, promises to free the ordinary individual from the long working day, exhausting labor and economic
            insecurity, thus providing him with opportunities for personal development far greater and richer than those
            enjoyed under the individualistic economy of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.3
               
            
            In regard to the applications of this educational philosophy, the Report included some
          paragraphs provocative of thought:
            
               If the school is to justify its maintenance and assume its responsibilities, it must recognize the new
            order and proceed to equip the rising generation to co-operate effectively in the increasingly
            interdependent society and to live rationally and well within its limitations and possibilities.
               It thus follows that educators are called upon to examine critically the frame of reference under which
            they have been operating, and to proceed deliberately to the clarification and affirmation of purpose in the
            light of the changed and changing social situation and in the light of those facts and trends which remain
            compelling, irrespective of individual preferences.
               Educators stand today between two great philosophies of social economy: the one representing the immediate
            past and fading out in actuality, an individualism in economic theory which has become hostile in practice
            to the development of individuality for great masses of the people and threatens the survival of American
            society; the other representing and anticipating the future on the basis of actual trends—the
            future already coming into reality, a collectivism which may permit the widest development of personality or
            lead to a bureaucratic tyranny 
                     
                        3 See vol. XVI of the Report, 33-54.
                  
                   destructive of ideals of popular democracy and cultural freedom.
               If education continues to emphasize the philosophy of individualism in economy, it will increase the
            accompanying social tensions. If it organizes a program in terms of a philosophy which harmonizes with the
            facts of a closely integrated society, it will ease the strains of the transition taking place in actuality.
            The making of choices cannot be evaded, for inaction in education is a form of action.4
               
            
            Never before have teachers of the social studies been confronted by graver responsibilities and larger
          opportunities than those before them today. They must chose between making a contribution to the development
          of citizens for the new social order or preparing students for participation in a system that no longer
          exists. May they have the wisdom and the courage to cast their lot for human progress.

            THE FOURTEENTH INDIANA REGIMENT IN THE VALLEY OF VIRGINIA
            LETTERS TO THE VINCENNES SUN
            
            In the December (1933) issue of the Indiana Magazine of History, there appeared a series of
          letters from Cheat Mountain and points near by that were written by a soldier of Company G, Fourteenth Indiana
          Regiment who used the signature "Prock." The letters were published in the 
                  
                     Vincennes
                   Western Sun (weekly) during the summer and fall of 1861. "Prock" was
          from 
                  Vincennes
               . His company became known as the "Invincibles". Company B of the same regiment
          was known as the "Old Post Guards". The Fourteenth and also the Thirteenth Indiana Regiments
          saw important service in the Valley of 
                  Virginia
                from December 1861 to June, 1862. "Prock's" letters to the 
                  Vincennes
               
               Sun during the period of the Valley activities of the Fourteenth Indiana are reproduced

                              at Philippi, Va.,
                           
                           Monday, Dec. 9, 1861.
                        
                        [Friend Greene:]
                        Wednesday morning at nine o'clock we were ordered to pack knapsacks, shoulder arms, and
                  march for this place without delay—Companies A, B, and C, left two days before. By eleven
                  o'clock the detachment—seven companies—under the command of Captain
                  Owens, was on the road—the boys in fine spirits, the day a fine one, and the pike frozen
                  hard. We reached Beverly at sundown, marched through and encamped one mile west of the town, in an
                  open field. Huge fires of well seasoned rails, were soon blazing brightly, and those who did not
                  immediately betake themselves to broiling slices of pork, making coffee, &c.,
                  ‘deployed’ for supper elsewhere. Surrounding farmhouses were filled with hungry
                  soldiers, willing and anxious to ‘come down’ with a quarter for a warm meal.
                  Your correspondent having disposed of a ‘rasher’ of bacon and destroyed nearly a
                  pound of crackers, became exceedingly dry, and returned to town with one of Co. G.'s
                  Sergeants (whose first name I forget) for a glass of lager, or something else. None to be obtained but
                  learned that there was an excellent article of corn-juice at the Union Hotel, one mile on the road to
                  Rich Mountain. Repaired thither—the old pickled sardine calling himself a landlord had only
                  a barrel left, and because it was not tapped refused to comfort us. Come to town and to camp; half a
                  mile the other side at a hotel known as the ‘Beverly House’, 
                              
                                 1
                                 
                                    Vincennes
                                 
                                 Western Sun (weekly), Dec. 21, 1861. After leaving Cheat Mountain, the
                      Fourteenth Indiana was for some time in camp at Huttonsville (south of Cheat Mountain on the upper
                      Tygart River). With other troops the Fourteenth was sent northward down the Tygart valley to
                      Philippi, where the above letter was written. The place was located west of 
                                    Laurel
                                  Hill. The editor of the Sun was George E. Greene.
                           
                            kept by one Russel, we obtained an excellent supper at 10, P.M.
                  Your correspondent spread himself on the dining table and with a catridge-box for a pillow slept
                  soundly till daylight.
                        The second day we marched at sunrise—a few of us making 20 miles over the roughest of
                  rough roads on 
                              Laurel
                            Hill, more like a mountain than any hill I ever saw. The sesesh entrenchments on the west
                  side are extensive and must have presented, before destroyed by our troops, a very formidable
                  appearance. An old man where I took dinner told me several of our Union balls passed close to his
                  house, around which the sesesh were encamped and the song they sung was anything but pleasant to him.
                  We reached the town of Bealington at 1, P.M., which reminded me of 
                              Westport
                           . The ‘pictur’ maker for Frank Leslie must have been under the
                  influence of some spirit that caused him to see double and ‘more too!’ We were
                  quartered the second night with a country cobbler— I am partial to cobblers. A
                  ‘baker's dozen’ of us occupied a room upstairs and had to make our beds
                  on the floor, as there was only one bed in the room, which we used for a pillow. Said knight of the
                  awl and lapstone was very religious and requested us to ‘resist from plain keerds, and
                  oblige hym;’ this request was made in ‘ritin’ and sent up by his
                  ‘sun jeems.’ The boys complied, with the request and
                  ‘resisted’ but next morning treated him to a manual of arms that made the old
                  hoop-pole shanty quiver. His white-haired, pink-eyed daughter remarked, as we rallied on the grub
                  piles at breakfast, ‘you fellers all looks alike to me;’ I am uncertain whether
                  it was intended as a compliment or not.
                        The third day the regiment had become pretty well scattered, from Beverly to Philippi, on account of
                  the condition of the pike &c., a squad of fast ones (those that could walk fast being at least
                  a day's march ahead of the main body). Toward night enquired where good quarters could be
                  obtained—were directed to the house of one Williams, about a mile off the
                  pike—proceeded thither and spent a holiday, regular 4th July, from 9, p.m. Friday till
                  sunrise Saturday morning, when we marched into town in good order; and here we are all together once
                  more and none the worse for our long march. The regiment is housed—Cos. D and G. in the
                  Court House, and other companies in hotels and private houses, that were deserted by their owners.
                        I presume the 14th will remain this winter in Philippi.
                        Coal is abundant at five cents per bushel delivered—the supply of pies equal to the
                  demand, at ten cents a piece. While in Huttonville those that indulged in the luxury had to fork over
                  a quarter. The way the 14th slay pies is a caution to bakers. It is no uncommon sight to see a soldier
                  just off guard, a pie under each arm, one on his bayonet, and another in his fist, with a half moon
                  cut in it.
                        Orderly 
                              Van
                            Dyke, Serg't Jackson, and myself, succeeded in securing boarding before the rush
                  came, and now have a sure thing for procuring grub done up in style.
                        Lieut. Patterson came in today—footed it all the way from Huttonville, as did the Captain;
                  both have been ill with camp fever.
                        Sergeant-Major Bailey was left behind at the Hospital; he is recovering slowly.
                        
                        I expect the ancient and honorable order of ‘Eclampsis’ will be revived here
                  this winter and several valuable accessions made to the brother-hood. ‘It is
                  well.’
                        Thanks to Postmaster Willis, of Bruceville [Indiana], for favors.
                        Sergeant Coleman is on guard to-day—chestnuts and pies will suffer. Corporal
                  D'Ewald has engagements to teach the several young ladies of Philippi, music on the
                  piano—lucky man! The Corporal has entirely recovered from his wound, received in the
                  skirmish of the 12th September, on Cheat Mountain.

                           Monday, Dec. 17, 1861.2
                           
                        
                        
                           Friend Greene:
                        
                        We leave for Romney to-morrow morning at 8 o'clock; or for Webster at least, and our
                  destination is reported to be Romney.
                        Since our advent here, the weather has been delightful—the 14th had just succeeded in
                  making themselves comfortable, when the order came to march immediately with three day's
                  rations. Cheerfully and with alacrity will that command be obeyed by both officers and
                  men—one and all are anxious to see active service again and obtain a
                  glimpse or more of ‘Sesesh.’
                        The rebels captured in the late fight at Green Bank, on Greenbrier river, reached here last night and
                  left for 
                              Columbus, Ohio
                           , this morning.
                        Lieutenant Matthew N. Green, of Co. B. (O. P. Guards,)3 captured nine sesesh the
                  other day, some 12 miles from here.
                        The health of the regiment is good—better than it has been at any time since we left Cheat
                  Mountain Summit.
                        The ‘Invincibles’ are under the immediate command of Lieutenant W. N. Denny,
                  Captain Coons not having as yet entirely recovered from his attack of camp fever.
                        Lieutenant Patterson will probably be able to march to Webster to-morrow, though he is still quite
                  weak. All members of Co. G. are O. K., and ready to ‘fall in’ at a moments
                  notice.

                           Christmas Eve., Dec. 24, 1861.4
                           
                        
                        
                           Friend G:
                        
                        The 14th left Philippi at 11 A. M. Thursday and reached Webster at sundown—the road almost
                  impassable. Fortunately wagons were furnished to transport knapsacks, and the march consequently was
                  not so fatiguing as it otherwise would have been. When the regiment 
                              
                                 2
                                 Western Sun, Dec. 28, 1861. The troops had now been at Philippi for about two
                      weeks.
                              
                                 3 Company B of the Fourteenth was known as the "Old Post
                      Guards."
                              
                                 4
                                 Western Sun, Jan. 4, 1862. Romney is east of the Alleghany Front on the South
                      Branch of the Potomac. This stream flows northeastward, running parallel to the mountains. It
                      joins the North Branch of the Potomac to form the Potomac a few miles be low
                          
                                    Cumberland, Maryland
                                 . The North Branch drains a part of the Alleghany Plateau and
                      breaks through the mountains southwest of 
                                    Cumberland
                                 . Romney is about twenty mile south of that city.
                           
                            hove in sight of the rail-road track, along came a
                  train—the first we had seen of the iron horse for six months and a half, to a day. A loud
                  cheer burst from our boys, answered by the waving of hats and handkerchiefs from passengers and others
                  on the train. Boarded the cars at 10, P. M., and were off. 'Twas a clear, cool moonlight
                  night, and the sublime scenery along the route induced your correspondent to keep his peepers open
                  till midnight, when, scenery or no scenery, he determined to 'fall in'on the floor
                  amongst the straw—did so and slept soundly till the train stopped at Piedmont at 7 A. M. P.
                  is quite a large town, with many substantial buildings. Like most towns in Western 
                              Virginia
                           , it is surrounded by a cordon of high, bold bluffs—here the hungry ones
                  speedily ‘deployed’ for grub, and soon returned loaded with apples, oysters,
                  cakes, sausage, and any amount of pies. Off again—passed some magnificient country
                  residences; the lady occupants at most of them appeared, waved their handkerchiefs, and were answered
                  by hurrahs from the 14th. At one o'clock ‘steamed’ into 
                              Cumberland
                           , Md. This is a large, well-built and truly beautiful city and the location a most
                  delightful one. Saw a great many pretty women here—‘birds eye views’
                  only. Fresh supplies of sausage, pies, &c., were obtained— also several canteens of
                  the ardent smuggled aboard. The Orderly and I dived into a saloon and obtained a
                  ‘few’ lager, resembling in taste an article we used to obtain in the Old Post
                  called beer—succeeded in disposing of ‘half a dozen’ very readily.
                        At 4 P. M., reached Green Spring Station—disembarked and prepared supper. Good fresh bread
                  and excellent shoulder meat was served out. Fresh oysters were abundant and cheap, and the meal was
                  perhaps the most palatable one the 14th had enjoyed since leaving Muncietown, Ind.
                        At 9 o'clock next evening we were on the march for Romney, over an excellent road. We found
                  the entire route 16 miles, picketed. Marched over a wire bridge at 3 P. M. stretched across the south
                  branch of the Potomac. The scenery in this immediate vicinity was beautiful beyond description. After
                  crossing, our route lay along the banks of the stream —at one place we passed the
                  ‘hanging rock,’ as it is called—a perpendicular rock fully 150 feet
                  high and a quarter of a mile in extent; pickets were posted on the top—a tall look out,
                  that.
                        Entered Romney at 7 P. M. The 5th 
                              Ohio
                            welcomed us in a manner never to be forgotten by the 14th. After cheering us heartily,
                  the cry arose—‘who stole your goose?’ ‘Twas promptly
                  answered—’those infernal thieves, the 32nd 
                              Ohio
                           !'5 The 5th then notified us that they had prepared coffee,
                  &c., for our regiment and invited the 14th, as soon as quartered, to come down and share their
                  hospitality, which invitation was accepted with the same generous spirit in which 'twas given
                  and soon the 14th were marching by companions towards the quarters of the gallant 5th, where we were
                  received with most cordial and friendly greetings and 
                              
                                 5 The soldiers of the Old Post Guards were the protectors of two pet birds
                      that were given the freedom of the camp. One was called "Reuben". the other
                      "Jeff Davis". Both were large ganders. "Reuben" was stolen by
                      a soldier belonging to the Thirty-second 
                                    Ohio
                                  Regiment, who with a few of his comrades dined sumptuously. Jeff Davis" was
                      not molested. Prock reveals that "Reuben" was brought to western 
                                    Virginia
                                  from Camp Vigo in Indiana by the Old Post Guards. "Jeff Davis",
                      however, was captured on Cheat Mountain.
                           
                            done justice to the ‘soldier's
                  fare’ so generously prepared by our 
                              Ohio
                            comrades. The 5th was the best armed and equiped regiment I have yet seen; they are
                  provided with the ‘Saxony rifle’, nearly an inch in the bore—range
                  1000 yards.
                        In the course of a week or so we shall obtain tents and not have to sleep huddled up like sheep in a
                  pen as we do now. Fifty-two men for picket guard from the 14th daily,—looks like war again.
                  The boys are in excellent spirits and all anxious for a sight at the sesesh once more.
                        Romney reminds me of 
                              Petersburg
                           , Ind., though the surrounding country is far more picturesque. The 14th is at home
                  here—meet old acquaintances—all glad to see us every day.
                        Capt. Daum is here with his battery—the same that was with us on Cheat Mountain Summit so
                  long. All the regiments except ours are encamped in tents; we are quartered in houses.
                        The 13th Indiana, I understand, is to be here soon.
                        No Christmas for us this year—however we wish a merry one and Happy New Year to those at
                  home.

                           January 8, 1862.6
                           
                        
                        
                           Friend Greene:
                        
                        Portions of each regiment encamped here marched yesterday, with one day's rations, to attack
                  the enemy at Blue Gap, sixteen miles east on the 
                              Winchester
                            road. Left Romney at 1 o'clock A. M.— morning bitter cold, wind
                  blowing fiercely from the west with occasional flights of snow. The 4th and 5th 
                              Ohio
                           , with Daum's battery, in advance of us—the 7th 
                              Ohio
                            and 1st 
                              Virginia
                            bringing up the rear, while the Ringgold cavalry and a part of Howard's battery
                  of rifled cannon were in advance of all. Two hours' steady marching and we had passed the
                  extreme out-posts and seven miles on our way towards ye Gap [Blue Gap]. Were halted frequently to
                  rest—the boys would throw themselves down on the snow-covered hill sides, and many fall
                  asleep ere the word came "fall in." At 7 o'clock we reached the top of a
                  high hill, from which the country was visible for miles around. In front was a broad valley, a small
                  river running through it. Our "advance" drawn up on the west bank near a small
                  bridge—three rifled cannon were in position near US commanding the bridge, while Capt. Daum
                  with five brass six-pounders had chosen a position in the valley.
                        The right wing of the 14th was left here to protect the artillery, while the remainder descended the
                  east side of the hill on "double quick." Before we reached the stream, the 4th and
                  5th 
                              Ohio
                           , deployed as skirmishers to the right and left of the pike, had commenced popping away
                  merrily at the sesesh, now plainly visible, posted behind a breast work on the right of the road half
                  a mile from the stream and directly opposite the Gap. The Buckeye [
                              Ohio
                           ] skirmishers advanced steadily, keeping up a constant fire; the 14th cheered and our
                  "double quick" quickened to a run over the narrow bridge.
                        We went up to within a hundred yards of the Gap, when we were ordered to "flank to the
                  right" up the mountain, and the 7th 
                              Ohio
                            moved 
                              
                                 6
                                 Western Sun, Jan. 18, 1862.
                           
                            to the front. Just as the 14th had succeeded in obtaining a foot
                  hold on the steep ascent and the 7th were about entering the Gorge, out came a horseman (Col. of the
                  4th, I think) at full speed shouting, "The rebels are retreating! Cavalry forward!"
                  The 7th immediately "opened ranks," and in less time that it takes to write it, the
                  Ringgold boys, headed by a Lieutenant, flourishing their sabres with a wild hurrah charged up the pike
                  into the sesesh camp—through it, and never pulled rein till they had chased the rebels for
                  five miles on the road to 
                              Winchester
                           , and compelled them to seek safety by clambering up the mountain sides, where
                  'twas impossible for horsemen to follow.
                        I wish the folks at home could have witnessed that charge and heard the loud and prolonged cheers
                  that arose from the infantry as the gallant horsemen rushed irresitably through the narrow defile.
                        Having climbed the mountain, the 14th descended into the rebel camp without exchanging a shot with
                  the enemy.
                        The Buckeye boys had rifled and fired the tents and "winter quarters;" also a large
                  mill in which were the rebel commissary stores, fifty bushels of wheat, a lot of muskets, and a small
                  quantity of ammunition. Two pieces of cannon were captured—a ten-pounder (rifled) and one
                  six-pounder. Some fine horses were also taken, attached to the guns.
                        Sitting on a pine stump to rest and eat my breakfast, I caught sight of two dead rebels lying a few
                  yards off—one a large man, shot through the head—hole big enough to put your
                  fist through; while the other's head was divided by a sabre stroke.
                        Having destroyed the camp and a large house and barn near the bridge, our forces formed and took up
                  their line of march for Romney, and an amusing sight it was. Here a squad of infantry, with a knapsack
                  or two each—strings of sausage, lengths of stove pipe, bed quilts, brooms, buckets full of
                  honey, extra guns, chickens, turkies, loaves of bread, and other articles too numerous to mention. I
                  saw the skeletons of two female sesesh (i. e., their hoops) dangling from the
                  bayonet of a wild looking volunteer.
                        I noticed one of the cavalry had an extra large share of the "spoils of
                  war"—a large turkey and half a dozen chickens hung from his saddlebow, while a
                  feather bed, three different colored blankets, a broom, a skillet and a goose were fastened on behind.
                        The march back home was a tedious and toilsome one for the footmen. Order and discipline were
                  forgotten, and the boys got along as best they could, each on his own hook.
                        Sergeant-Major Bailey has rejoined the regiment, and though still quite weak has resumed his duties.
                        Our friend the "Governor" told me this morning he had procured a discharge on
                  account of disability. Am exceedingly sorry to have him go, but he is constitutionally totally unfit
                  to endure the hardships of a soldier's life in the camp and field.
                        4 P. M.—-"All quiet on the Potomac."

                           Friend Greene:
                        
                        The regiment left Romney on Friday night, as did all the Union forces encamped there. Your
                  correspondent was on the advance post picket guard with ten men, seven miles and a half from Romney,
                  on the Morefield pike. At dark a cavalryman came galloping up and notified us that the forces were in
                  motion moving Westward, and delivered the order for the pickets to be all drawn in and follow their
                  respective regiments immediately. We reached town at 9 o'clock and found it evacuated by all
                  our troops except the six companies of cavalry who were to act as rear guard—pushed on
                  through mud and slush—night dark and stormy. The 14th boys are walkers, and although the
                  regiment had the advantage of three or four hours start, by 3 A. M. we had caught up with them.
                        I partook of a very light breakfast at 
                              Springfield
                            about sunrise, to-wit: the last cracker in my haver-sack. Here we took the road to
                  Patterson's Creek Station, and at 8 o'clock halted for the night and encamped in a
                  meadow. Not a dry spot visible on which to spread our blankets— had none myself, as all the
                  guards' knapsacks and "traps" had been sent to 
                              Cumberland
                           . We had nothing to eat, and those that were without their blankets stood in
                    the water around our bivouac fires, smoking (thank fortune we do not have to depend on sutler
                  or quarter-master for tobacco), and swearing not a little till morning, when the regiment marched down
                  the railroad track to this place.
                        Camped first night in the open air; next day received our new tents (Sibley pattern), and the day
                  following our stoves. Tents and stoves were hailed with delight by our boys—we feel that we
                  are once more at home. Five tents to a company, supposed to furnish ample room for twenty men each.
                  The stoves render them comfortable, and in fact better quarters no soldiers would ask for.
                        We are six miles east of 
                              Cumberland
                           , Md., and belong to the first division, which is composed of the 13th and 14th Indiana,
                  7th 
                              Virginia
                            and 84th 
                              Pennsylvania
                           , regiments, under the immediate command of Col. Nathan Kimball.
                        The weather for the past few days has been exceedingly cold, with almost a constant fall of sleet and
                  snow.
                        Our Sutler has "played out," I fancy, as we have seen nothing of that individual
                  for some two months. 'Twould perhaps be a fine thing for the regiment if 'twas so,
                  as these gentlemen sutlers skin [overcharge] the soldiers unmercifully.
                        Captain Coons has gone to 
                              Cumberland
                           , and will send a "telegram" to the Old Post for those
                    boxes of goods. Many of our boys are greatly in need of the articles contained therein, having
                  lost considerable clothing on recent forced marches.
                        The health of Company G. is good—all the sick in our regiment are immediately sent to 
                              Cumberland
                            where there is a large and comfortable hospital.
                        
                           
                              7
                              Western Sun. Jan. 25, 1862. The B. and O. bridge spanned the North Branch of the
                    Potomac between 
                                 Cumberland
                               and the junction of the two forks of the Potomac. The railway runs south of the Potomac
                    from Harper's Ferry to this bridge.
                        
                        
                        What occasioned the retrograde movement of the army I can't say—am thankful to be
                  delivered from the cramped and dirty quarters and most miserable water that sesesh town of Romney
                  afforded.
                        Is there much doing in the commission and forwarding business? Wonder if the new firm of C. &
                  K., since they got their hand (and foot) in, have undertaken the job of forwarding the "What
                  is It?" or "any other man."
                        We are looking anxiously for Captain Cash, as the entire regiment is about
                  "strapped." Hope we may not march from here till he comes.

                           Friend Greene:
                        The 14th has been on the move so much of late that your correspondent could find no time to write.
                        Wednesday night at eleven o'clock we boarded the cars and steamed down the road twenty-two
                  miles. About daylight the train halted and the regiment disembarked, built fires along the side of the
                  railroad track, and thawed out our benumbed and stiffened limbs, the ride in open boxcars having
                  cramped us up considerably, and more, too.
                        Grub being scarce, the boys obtained leave to knock over anything in the eating live that was to be
                  found on its legs within range. A general deploy for fresh rations took place
                  immediately—and sheep, "slow deer" (porkers), rabbits, ducks, geese,
                  &c., were made to suffer that day.
                        The pickets of 110th 
                              Pennsylvania
                            ("Tom Thumb regiment") became frightened at the noise made by the
                  hunters' guns, and ran in, thinking the sesesh were about. During Thursday and the night
                  following the regiments poured in on every train. The old 13th Indiana came along, and was received
                  with a tremendous yell by our boys. No two regiments in the service think more of each other than the
                  13th and 14th Indiana.
                        Friday about noon these two were formed in line, "piled" into the cars, and moved
                  down to this place, where we arrived about 2 P. M. Having formed line of battle and loaded our guns,
                  took a scout of a few miles out on the pike leading to 
                              Winchester
                           , some 40 miles distant—saw no sesesh, and no "sign." About
                  faced, marched back and into the cars again, when we received the order to disembark—did so
                  and bivoucked on the spot. A large pile of pine lumber, two stacks of hay, and a huge rick of straw
                  vanished in a jiffy.
                        After roughing it for three nights, and cold ones, too, we are once more at home, that is under our
                  canvass coverings, and comfortable.
                        The R. R. Tunnel at this place is a short one—only some 300 feet. Our pickets extend for
                  10 miles eastward on the R. R.
                        Lieut. Denny with a section of Co. "G." went out on picket guard last night. As the
                  fellow said by his chickens, I can only say there is "a right smart chance" of us
                  here.
                        
                           
                              8
                              Western Sun. Feb. 26, 1862. If the distance was about forty miles from 
                                 Winchester
                              , this camp on the B. and O. must have been almost due north of that town and near the
                    Potomac.
                        
                        
                        We are sadly behind in the news line—know nothing of what is going on in America.
                        I see by the papers that several soldiers, formerly of the 14th, who are said to have been
                  "through the campaign in Western 
                              Virginia
                           ," are recruiting for other regiments. The through meant I
                  suppose to the tune of— 
                              "Hey Jim a 'long, Jim a 'long Josey,"—
                            our regimental "sick call."
                        Whilst at Camp North Branch Bridge Companies B. and G. received a full supply of under-clothing,
                  mittens, tippets, &c.; Likewise, a "heaps of goodies" and something stronger
                  than water—for all of which the members of the two companies are extremely thankful, no
                  doubt; one that I know of is, at all events. Where will those that have no friends in this world go to
                  in the next?
                        12 o'clock—orders to prepare two days' rations and march at 1
                  o'clock.

                                    Ohio
                                  R. R., Va.,
                           
                           Feb. 17, 1862.9
                           
                        
                        
                           Friend Greene:
                        
                        It is forty-one miles from here to 
                              Winchester
                           . The pike runs southeast for fifteen miles, then "obliques" to the left
                  and pursues a due east course through a gap in the mountains known as Bloomery. There was supposed to
                  be a force of some four or five thousand rebels, strongly fortified and entrenched at this place, and
                  on the evening of the 13th inst. a portion of the forces encamped here marched (at precisely 4
                  o'clock) to dislodge them.
                        The 14th followed the pike four miles, then "filed left," taking a country road
                  hardly wide enough for two men to walk abreast. After a tedious and toilsome march of six hours, we
                  halted to rest in a deep valley—built fires and lay on our arms for a couple of hours, till
                  a bridge of wagons, covered with loose plank, was completed over a branch of the Capon. By one
                  o'clock A. M. we were safely over and pushing ahead at "quick time" over
                  the steep and slippery, snow-covered mountain. Daylight found us in sight and in the rear of ye Gap,
                  every gun loaded and capped and the boys all eager for a fight.
                        Some three hundred cavalry accompanied the expedition, and were the advance guard. They returned here
                  with information that no rebels nor sign of rebels or fortifications were to be found in the Gap, and
                  the disappointed infantry were about to "stack arms" and prepare breakfast, when
                  some lynx-eyed cavalryman discovered a sesesh taking observations in another direction than the one in
                  which 'twas expected the enemy would appear. The horsemen were put in motion and charged up
                  the pike, followed by the 14th at "double quick." The road was muddy— the
                  mud as stiff as well worked motar. We were weary with a night's hard tramp and encumbered
                  with overcoats, blankets, grub, &c., so the riders were soon out of sight and into the squad
                  of some three hundred 
                              
                                 9
                                 Western Sun, March 1, 1862.
                           
                            sesesh militia, who scattered to the four winds after firing one
                  ineffectual volley.
                        The cavalry took some forty prisoners, amongst them a Colonel, two Captains, and two Lieutenants.
                  Several rebels were sent "over 
                              Jordan
                           ."
                        Our horsemen then pushed on up the pike to capture some twelve or fifteen wagons, loaded with
                  commissary stores, small arms, ammunition, &c. They had surrounded the wagons and turned them,
                  when about fifty shots were fired into them from off a high and inaccessable bluff, killing two and
                  mortally wounding a third.
                        Before the 14th could reach the spot the rebels were again on a full run for 
                              Winchester
                           , twenty miles distant. Our boys started (with 39 rounds) at "double
                  quick" through the mud, with three hundred horsemen ahead, to keep the game most effectually
                  scared and entirely out of range. Your correspondent thought it did not pay; so, after trying it on
                  for a mile, came down to "slow time," and took items:—Old man, about
                  seventy, standing in a meadow a short distance from the pike, surrounded by a squad of the 14th who
                  were questioning him. Exasperated cavalryman comes dashing back, leading the horse of his comrade who
                  had just been killed—saddle and horse covered with blood. "Stand away, boys, and
                  let me shoot the d—d old rebel." But the squad stood fast and the old
                  man's life was spared.
                        A little boy was crying as though his very heart was broken. "Oh! they have killed my
                  brother, and they are going to kill father, too!" His brother, like all these
                  "bush-whackers," had fired on our men and then undertook to save his cowardly life
                  by throwing away his gun and running into a house, but an Enfield bullet had overtaken him in his
                  flight.
                        Two women, the wife and mother of a sesesh Captain of bushwhackers, were filling the air with their
                  cries of despair and grief over his body—refusing to surrender his weapons when twice
                  called upon to do so. A cavalryman had nearly severed him in twain by a blow from his sabre.
                        Corporal Thomas B. Thompson, of the "Invincibles," and one of the "Tiger
                  Tail Mess," discovered a sesesh hid under a brush pile lying in a stream of water, and nearly
                  frozen—made him "come to Limerick" and show where his gun was concealed.
                        Some dozen barrels of flour, a large lot of corn, besides rice, coffee, sugar, molasses and whisky
                  were discovered.
                        The prisoners taken were "flush"—pockets full of rebel scrip, mostly
                  twenty-five cent shinplasters, payable at 
                              Winchester
                           . It seems there had been quite a force at this place until lately—the men
                  having been paid off (?) All those whose term of enlistment expired had gone home, and the small force
                  remaining fearing an attack, were preparing to leave for 
                              Winchester
                            when our boys appeared and routed them.
                        A corps of sharpshooters, 
                              Massachusetts
                            men, with heavy rifles weighing form [from] 25 to 60 pounds and telescope sights, were
                  out with us, but never got a shot.
                        Altogether this was the "toughest and roughest" scout our regiment ever took.
                        
                        Johnny Kelley, the smallest man and hardest "knut" in the 14th, captured a
                  Harper's Ferry breach-loading rifle.
                        Joe Roseman has a 
                              Mississippi
                            rifle.
                        The boys all had the "dead loads" of honey, molasses, other sweet things, and
                  eatables, and though tired out and foot-sore, arrived in camp in the best of spirits.
                        The 4th 
                              Ohio
                            boys scouting on another road captured a large rebel flag manufactured of the finest
                  silk.
                        Hope the Governor10 will enjoy his furlough.
                        Mail just to hand. Letter for me from "Kizer." Bully!
                        John G. Burrill is with us again.
                        Am sleepy—was on guard all last night. It is raining, hailing, snowing, blowing, and there
                  is no telling when you will hear again from

                           March 10, 1862.11
                           
                        
                        
                           Friend Greene:
                        
                        Since I last wrote you many changes have taken place.
                        We were called out one cold, stormy day (Monday, 3d,) to pay our last respects to the remains of the
                  brave General Lander. The ceremonies were very imposing, and the display a splendid one to lookers on —but three hours under arms was rather tough on us.
                        Wednesday, 5th inst., struck tents at 10 A. M., during a driving snow storm—marched aboard
                  the cars, and at 4 P. M. were en-route for this city. Holes were knocked in the top of our railroad
                  quarters—stoves put up, and the 14th passed a comfortable night on the train. Breakfasted
                  at 7 A. M., fifty miles from our late camp at Paw Paw Tunnel. As the trains ran no further than 
                              Back Creek
                            Station, on account of the bridge being destroyed and the track completely ripped up, we
                  were compelled to foot it up the railroad track to North Mountain Station, five miles. Here the stars
                  and stripes were flying, and a squad of pretty girls stood on the platform to receive the gallant
                  Hoosiers; An American eagle in a large cage seemed to think his deliverers had come, by the way he
                  flew around. On the flag flying over the cage was inscribed: "Presented by the ladies to the
                  Hedgesville Blues"—and thereby hangs a tale, but 'tis too long for me to
                  relate here.
                        Having halted long enough to make a cup of coffee, we again pushed on leaving the railroad track, and
                  taking the road to Hedgesville, a small town of perhaps four hundred inhabitants—all
                  sesesh, I fancy, for I saw no Union bunting flying.
                        As we marched through, the face of the country entirely changed here—large farms, hundreds
                  of acres of cleared land, resembling a vast prairie—stone fences for miles and
                  miles—splendid country residences— hills taking the place of the huge mountains
                  we have never been out of sight of for seven months—heavy oak timber instead of the
                  everlasting 
                              
                                 10 The term "Governor" as here used was a nickname for a

                                  soldier who had gone home on a furlough. (See end of letter of Jan. 8. above).

                                 Western Sun, March 22. 1862. 
                                    Martinsburg
                                  is northeast of 
                                    Winchester
                                  on the B and O. It is about half way from the last camping place to Harper's
                      Ferry.
                           
                            pine and cedar—and everything in fact presenting an
                  appearance of a fertile, rich and populous country, instead of the barren wastes, with here and there
                  a cabin, that have heretofore met our eyes.
                        The road was ankle deep in mud and no chance for dodging it—so, by the time the regiment
                  struck the pike, leading from 
                              Hagerstown
                            to 
                              Winchester
                           , some 3 miles west of this city [
                              Martinsburg
                           ], we were weary and fatigued; but the smooth, hard pike and close proximity to our
                  journey's end for the night, revived us and a quick step brought us into this sesesh town by
                  10 P. M. Vacant buildings were soon filled with tired soldiers, and your correspondent, after half an
                  hour's "deploy" to see all that was visible by the fast waning moon-light,
                  turned in and slept as only a tired soldier can sleep.
                        The rebels have left their mark here—forty-four locomotives stand on the tracks
                  here—all a perfect wreck; a fine bridge, some 300 feet long, built on sixteen stone
                  pillars, formerly a splendid structure, is now a heap of rubbish; two or three miles out of the city
                  on the railroad track there is a deep run completely filled with demolished locomotives, passenger and
                  other cars; the workshops have been stripped of all their tools and machinery, and the wonder is that
                  they, too, were not destroyed —even the turn-tables are all gone. It would be gratifying to
                  see the fiends that accomplished this wholesale destruction of property hanging from tall gibbets
                  along the line of their operations.
                        The Union vote in this county (
                              Berkley
                           ) was 800. Many fine residences are vacant, and all the churches, halls, and public
                  buildings are occupied by our troops.
                        King and Queen streets are the two great thoroughfares, and in fact are the only finished streets in
                  the city. There is a splendid cemetery near town, and occupying the only spot of ground from which a
                  view of the entire place can be obtained. Stone is the principal building material.
                        Faulkner's residence on Queen street is altogether the most handsome one in the city, and
                  the surroundings exhibit a display of good taste, neatness, and "style" that I have
                  not seen equalled in

                        Gen. Kimball arrived to-day—four days' rations have just been
                  drawn—the 14th will be off again soon, I presume; if not, will send YOU another batch of

                        Having reached a strip of woods, we had to climb a fence, the balls whistling over our heads. Wounded
                  and dead men were strewn thickly around. Once more in an open field, we formed a line and marched
                  right up the hill—the storm of leaden hail increasing at every step. We were soon at the
                  top—when a scene presented itself that I never will forget. Immediately in front of our
                  whole lines, at a distance of perhaps 80 or 90 yards, was a long wreath of blue smoke settled over a
                  low stone wall—

                                 Western Sun, April 12, 1862. This letter, the first portion of which was
                      ommitted by the Sun appeared in the same issue, but was set up after the letter
                      of March 29. as it reached the editor later. It was published because of the "graphic
                      description of the 
                                    Winchester
                                  fight". The date is missing. but it was written before March 29 and after
                      March 23, when the battle occurred o'ose to 
                                    Winchester
                                 . There was a later and more important battle of 
                                    Winchester
                                  which occurred on May 25.
                           
                            out of this a line of fire flashed constantly. Between our line
                  and this wall the dead and wounded lay in heaps, while clustered around the stars and stripes, a few
                  heroic blue jackets still fought desperately—some standing, some kneeling, and others lying
                  at full length; but all apparently determined to die right there. But we had come to the rescue of
                  these brave men, and the old 14th poured in a tremendous volley—gave a long, loud
                  cheer—another volley, and then charged the "stone wall brigade" with the
                  bayonet. In a moment the sesesh were scattered and flying in all directions, save one—their
                  right wing, resting on one of their batteries, stood their ground for a moment and fought desperately
                  with our left.
                        I saw Sergeant-Major Tom Bailey pitch forward full length, and thought the brave fellow had
                  "gone under;" but up he jumped, snatched his Enfield, and began loading it.
                        Finding the Hoosiers too much for them, the rebels attempted to draw off their battery; but the
                  riders were shot as fast as they mounted, and finally there were no horses to mount.
                        Our cavalry on the extreme right were cutting and shooting, and our whole regiment, every man
                  fighting on his own hook, was swiftly advancing up a long, steep hill. Each man, as he reached the
                  top, commenced firing from behind rocks and trees. In a few moments a brigade of fresh troops marched
                  up in good order to the top of this hill, and again a storm of balls swept over our boys; but nothing
                  daunted, they stood their ground, and with colors to the front fought as men should fight who battle
                  for the right.
                        For half an hour, the tempest of bullets swept through, around and over us—when all at
                  once Lieutenant Colonel Foster, of the 13th Indiana, galloped up and spoke a few words to our acting
                  Adjutant. Looking around I saw the gallant 13th with colors flying swiftly marching to support us. In
                  a moment more they poured in a volley—then another and another, and again the rebels took
                  to their heels.
                        The sun had set and darkness gathered over the battle-field.
                        Every man of the rebel Jackson's army would have been slain or captured could two more hours
                  of daylight have been spared for our troops.
                        Our regiment with the rest remained on the field or battle all night without fires.
                        Parties of men were engaged during the whole night searching for wounded soldiers. Signal lights were
                  flashing in the distance; but, save the rumbling of the ambulance wheels or the neighing of restive
                  horses, no sound disturbed the solemn stillness around.
                        At early dawn the regiments, or fragments rather, were formed and amunition distributed.
                        Co. G counted off 16 men, but reinforcements continued to arrive during the morning, and by noon we
                  had doubled the number.
                        Monday we marched after the flying rebels—our artillery opening upon them from every hill
                  top, and cavalry charging from every crossroad.
                        
                        Many were sent to their long homes—a number wounded, and several prisoners taken during
                  the day.
                        On Tuesday, having pursued the sesesh several miles beyond Straus-burg, we about faced and returned
                  to this place [Strasburg].

                           Friend Greene:
                        We are all quiet now, after the terrible battle near 
                              Winchester
                           , (of which you have no doubt long since given the particulars) and are hugely enjoying
                  this bright, warm spring day.
                        This is certainly a beautiful location for a town—the north branch of the Shenandoah, a
                  narrow, deep, swift stream, runs past the town site, on the eastward, following the base of a tall,
                  dark cedar-covered spur of the Blue Ridge. The surrounding country is a succession of large,
                  oval-shaped hills—the fences stone, and although the soil is decidedly rocky and full of
                  grit (which the inhabitants seem to lack), nevertheless the wheat crop looks well. There is abundant
                  evidence that properly farmed these hills would yield rich harvests.
                        There is a 
                              Boston
                            lady in town who has been trying to get home for a year. The stars and stripes were a
                  welcome sight to her.
                        Of what is going on in the world outside we soldiers know nothing. The Commissary has fed us on side
                  meat and crackers till we are tired of it—no vegetables or fresh meat for weeks past.
                        Three of Co. G. were wounded in the late battle; Corporal James H. Simposon, in the arm; privates
                  John P. Connelly, through the hand, and Michael Mulrille [in] the leg.
                        Hairbreadth escapes were numerous. Amos Edmonson, of our company, had two guns struck from his hands
                  by the enemy's balls. Paul Truckey was as wild as a deer, and ran headlong after the rebels
                  as a dog would chase a rabbit, loading and firing as he went.
                        The two color bearers were shot down but other equally brave fellows carried the two banners to the
                  front.
                        Many trophies have been captured, but a soldier that endeavors to do his duty has no time to look
                  after plunder.
                        I saw dozens of rebels throw down their arms, the better to augment their flight. At times a squad of
                  a dozen would be seen hastening away together. A volley from the pursuing Hoosiers would be poured in,
                  and not a running rebel escape.
                        One round each of grape and cannister was poured into us from a twelve-pounder, but before the rebels
                  could load again the Enfields of our gallant left wing had sent all the gunners over 
                              Jordan
                           .
                        Acting Adjutant Robert F. Catterson had his horse shot from under him, and seizing a gun, fought on
                  foot.
                        The sesesh were well clad, but no two dressed alike. Their "stone wall brigade"
                  fought well, having advantage of ground and being partially protected, but the go-ahead Hoosiers
                  "went in" without any other

                            thought or intention than to come out winners, and win they
                  did—though 'twas by the very hardest kind of fighting.

                            (Tom Thumb regiment) ran like dogs from a few shell that burst near them.
                        Supper had been prepared in 
                              Winchester
                            for Jackson and his staff. During the advance of his forces towards 
                              Winchester
                           , the ladies in all the small towns turned out and presented milk, pies, cakes,
                  &c., to the rebel soldiers, but next day there were no luxuries for the poor devils, and had
                  there been they would not have had time to more than grab 'em.

                           Friend Greene:
                        For the past few days we have been encamped without tents in the woods, within a few hundred yards of
                  the pike—the location an excellent one, weather delightful and the boys of the 14th never
                  enjoying better health or seemingly in higher spirits.
                        On the 1st day of April we left our tents and knapsacks at Straus-bourg, arid with a couple of
                  days' rations in our haversacks, took a byroad to the right of the pike, acting as flankers
                  to General Banks. Advanced slowly, capturing two of Ashby's cavalry, and about noon entered
                  Woodstock from the west side—quite a pretty little village—a few very handsome
                  residences. Several of our cannon balls and shells had left their mark on the dwellings.
                        We pushed on—passed a camping ground where the rebels had once had a large
                  force—crossed a bridge over a small tributary of the Shen-andoah, the timbers still smoking
                  from the attempt made by the sesesh to destroy it. The vandals succeeded in destroying the bridge
                  across the Shenandoah at Edinburg, and our troops are now rebuilding it. The sesesh pickets
                  occasionally come out of the woods and fire at our boys, but so far without effect; sometimes they
                  haul out a "bull dog" and open on us with shell, but never fire over one round till
                  our batteries (always wide awake) compel them to return to cover. Every hour in the day may be heard
                  the roar of artillery and bursting of shells.
                        Some of the 13th and 14th Indiana with their Enfields obtained leave to go over and shoot at a squad
                  of rebel horsemen that appeared the other day across the stream. Away went the Hoosiers and presently
                  the rifles were popping, and three of the saddles were emptied. The infantry now advanced and the
                  skirmish waxed warm, and might have terminated in a general battle, but Gen. Banks came down and had
                  the Hoosiers called back.
                        Our Sutler is here with a pretty large stock of good things, which he is disposing of at 
                              California
                            prices.
                        The boys are engaged in signing the "pay-rolls," and I presume Captain
                  "Cash" is on hand.
                        
                           
                              14
                              Western Sun, April 19, 1862. Woodstock is southwest of Strasburg to New
                  Market.
                        
                        
                        Colonel Nathan Kimball is; I see, promoted to a Brigadier General. I trust the 14th will be attached
                  to his brigade during the war.
                        Some "fighting stock" left in the Old Post yet, it seems. Pity there is not a
                  shooting-gallery in town.
                        The Governor15 has joined the regiment again—looks better than I ever
                  saw him—gave me some rich accounts of scenes in and around 
                              Vincennes
                           —says "things" are all O. K. in America.
                        Assisted the Sergeant Major in disposing of the contents a certain tin can contained, sent him by
                  William Curtain.
                        Friends at home must not grumble if the letters they receive from soldiers are few and far between.
                  We march to-day, fight to-morrow, and march again; leaving baggage behind. Frequently it is a week
                  before it comes to hand, and then, tired, foot-sore, and weary perhaps, do not feel like writing.
                        Charles Otto Mittler, James Rower, and James McMullen, who have been absent sick in the hospital at 
                              Cumberland
                           , Md.; returned to the company this morning. Glad to welcome them. Joseph Wilmer, Thomas
                  H. C. Beale, Albert Wicks, and Asher W. Foster are still behind—the two former at Federick,
                  and the latter at Strausburg.
                        Some of the 67th 
                              Ohio
                            boys kicked a sesesh shell in their camp fire this morning when it exploded, slightly
                  wounding four of that regiment and knocking down one of the 14th, who rising to his feet, gave the
                  frightened Buckeyes a tall cursing that was heard all over camp.

                        P. S.—Heard the General16 had opened a picture gallery. Success

                              Camp of the 14th Indiana Volunteers, Near New Market,
                           
                           April 26th, '62.17
                           
                        
                        
                           Friend Greene:
                        More than a week since, on a cold, wet day, Captain Cash settled with the regiment, and the boys were
                  made to rejoice—having four months' pay jingling in their pockets. Same day, late
                  in the afternoon, a detachment of the 14th, under command of Captain Coons, started on a scout to 
                              Columbia
                            Furnace, a small town almost buried in the mountain. About a dozen houses, filled with
                  boys and girls of "both sexes", and women of all ages, sizes, colors and
                  complexion,—these last were apparently overjoyed to see the troops—declared in
                  favor of the Union and certainly by their treatment of our boys proved their assertions true. The
                  detachment was lothe to leave this fairy abode.
                        Fifty-seven of Ashby's Cavalry, sixty horses, two wagon loads of bacon, and one of small
                  arms were captured during the expedition. The Ringgold Cavalry (the best we have) assisted in the
                  capture.
                        Another detachment left camp at 5, P. M., Wednesday, the 15th instant, to flank Jackson's
                  position at Mount Jackson.
                        Precisely at 11 o'clock, that same night, the third detachment under command of Capt.
                  Williamson (Co. F.) moved down the pike and crossed 
                              
                                 15 See footnote 10, above.
                              
                                 16 The term "General" as here used applied to some
                      citizen of 
                                    Vincennes
                                 .
                              
                                 17
                                 Western Sun, April 26. 1862. New Market is located in the upper Shenandoah
                      Valley, about fifty miles southwest of 
                                    Winchester
                                 .
                           
                            the bridge beyond Edinburg. Your correspondent being attached to
                  this squad through the day, will note down a few of the items:—Once over on the Sesesh side
                  of the Shenandoah, we advanced cautiously, the moon shining brightly—night cold and clear.
                  Presently, bang went half a dozen muskets, the balls whistling over and around us. Without returning
                  the fire, we pushed on—half a mile more gained, when the rebel pickets again opened on us.
                  This time the 14th burnt powder, and charging the rascals, succeeded in capturing three prisoners.
                  Long before daylight the bridges ahead were set on fire. We were not fired into again till sun rise,
                  two miles from Mount Jackson. Our squad and the 67th 
                              Ohio
                           , deployed as skirmishers, advancing through a wheat field, when half a dozen horsemen
                  rode out of the woods, a half mile in front, and a twelve pound howitzer was soon brought to bear on
                  us. I distinctly saw the gunner as he jerked the lanyard. Bang! And whiz! comes a well-aimed shell,
                  bursting some ten feet in advance of our line and throwing dirt and gravel all over us, almost before
                  he had time to "drap." Four more of these "top o' the
                  mornin' till ye's" were fired in quick succession, bursting over and around
                  us, a fragment breaking the wrist of one private in the 67th. By this time 500 of our cavalry had come
                  up and charged the gun squad and its support of rebel horsemen. With a parting shot at the blue
                  jackets, Mr. Sesesh "limbered up" and put off at double-quick—think
                  'tis somewhat doubtful whether he has halted yet.
                        It is said that one of the artillery riders in the retreat from 
                              Winchester
                            never pulled rein till he reached Staunton.
                        This is the last sight your correspondent has had of a Sesesh.
                        Our advance regiments are beyond Harrisonburg.18
                        
                        Mount Jackson is decidedly a one-horse place; ditto New Market; but there is no discount on the
                  country residences and farms surrounding them in the vicinity.
                        Two days ago, two scouts belonging to the 13th Indiana, while returning from a visit to the valley
                  beyond, discovered fresh horse tracks leading from the pike directly up the mountain. Following, they
                  came upon a Captain and Lieutenant of Ashby's Cavalry. Both parties fired— the
                  Lieutenant fell dead, shot through the head; the Captain jumped off his horse and escaped by running
                  down a deep ravine. The boys captured two fine horses, some valuable papers and a large spy-glass,
                  with which the rebels no doubt proposed to take a view of our camps.
                        Banks (so John Dunkle, of the 13th Band informed me) gave the scouts $20 each.
                        Our regiment is once more together—this is the first time the 14th had to march towards
                  the enemy by reliefs—hope 'twill be the last.
                        Last Saturday night we camped out in an open field, nothing but the blue sky above us. Sunday, moved
                  into a strip of woods, when it began to rain and poured down for forty-eight hours without cessation.
                  We were short of rations, many without their blankets, and all without tents. Monday and Tuesday were
                  dreary days. Wednesday sun came out bright—tents came up, and we were soon snugly
                  quartered.
                        
                           
                              18 Harrisonburg is about seventeen miles southwest of Harrisonburg, not far
                    west of the southern end of Massanuten Mountain.
                        
                        
                        To-day 'tis snowing like fury.
                        Josiah J. Dunn, of Co. G, is quite ill at Woodstock. Recent exposure and hardship has increased our
                  sick list.
                        The boys are talking of getting up a club for the SUN. No trouble in procuring a score of subscribers
                  in the two 
                              Vincennes
                            companies— the only difficulty is, would the papers be allowed to come. Have
                  not seen one for three weeks, and know they are mailed regularly. Army mails are uncertain, I
                  know—cannot be otherwise where regiments are so constantly on the move; nevertheless, a man
                  ought to receive one paper out of six, which is more than your correspondent can boast of.
                        Glad the General is once more on duty. Has the commission and forwarding business played out?
                        
                           Truly yours,
                           PROCK.

                           April 28.19
                           
                        
                        
                           Friend Greene:
                        
                        Orders came for the 14th to march again at 10 o'clock Sunday morning, and we moved towards
                  Staunton once more and encamped within seven miles of Harrisonburg.
                        The 14th is "rolling in clover," as we have pitched tents in a big sesesh
                  clover-field—a deep and rapid brook rushes boiling and seething through the centre, and the
                  boys are splashing about in it by the score.
                        This being a bright, clear day, (the first one for a week) the boys are excused from drill and
                  allowed to "spread themselves" (and blankets) in the warm sunshine—wash
                  clothing, &c.
                        Corporal d'Ewald, who has been detailed since the battle of 
                              Winchester
                            to assist in the hospital there, re-joined the regiment this morning. He reports Michael
                  Mullville fast recovering from his wound; says John P. Connelly had left that place for Frederick, but
                  getting off the cars at Sandy Hook Station, has not been heard of since.
                        Major L. A. Foote; Capt. Thos. G. Williamson, Co. F; and Capt. T. C. Howard, Co. A, bid us farewell
                  at the last camp, and are on their march homeward, all having resigned.
                        Sergeant John E. Hutchins, Co. B, has just returned from the 
                              Cumberland
                            hospital. He reports Corporal Wm. H. Javins, Co. G, still quite ill in the hospital
                  there.
                        Private John Racine, of Co. B, formerly from Cathilinette, has been court martialed for robbery,
                  &c., and sentenced to six months' hard labor, without remuneration
                  therefor—his pay for the last four months also stopped.
                        I drew a ration of flour to-day—the first for a "month of Sundays," and
                  Paul Truckey, officer of the cook-house for Co. T, "Tiger Tail Mess," proposes
                  serving a "heavy surge" of Cheat Mountain Summit slap-jacks for dinner.
                        The following members of Co. G, 14th Indiana Volunteers, are now absent sick:
                        Corporal James H. Simpson, home on furlough; Corporal Wm. H. Javins, in hospital at 
                              Cumberland

                        Cephus McDonald, who I mentioned in my last as absent sick at Woodstock, has rejoined the
                  "Invincibles," all O.K.
                        The band of a 
                              Maine
                            regiment, having played a few tunes for a public celebration at 
                              Martinsburg
                           , had the "cheek" to pass around "de sasser."
                  D—n these "Down East," money-loving, Yankee band-box, Provost Guard
                  regiments! Dressed out in full rig, with all the extra (brass) touches on, and polished boots, they
                  take possession of the little towns along our line of march, as fast as we run the rebels
                    out—strut about like turkey goblers, with guns that have never fired a shot at
                  sesesh (nor never will), and woe to the unlucky soldier that is absent from his quarters without a
                  permit—"halt—-ah! What regiment—ah?"
                  "Fourteenth Indiana, damn you!" "Got a pass—ah!"
                  "No!" "Fall in the rear—ah!"
                        Marching through New Market a day or two ago, these holiday soldiers caught thunder.
                        As the regiment marches rapidly through a town filled with soldiers, 'tis amusing to hear
                  the welcomes and "parting words" of acquaintances —remarks from the
                  idlers and men in the ranks. "There goes the old Fourteenth Cheat Mountain Zouaves!"
                  "Yes," adds another; "those thirteen, mile-an-hour fellows."
                        Some soldier near the head of the column catches sight of a "familiar face" (likely
                  one of the 13th with whom he has been on picket.) "How are you, Jake?" And
                  "How are you, Jake," goes clear down the column.
                        Not having heard a cannon fire for more than a week, I presume that the rebels are a long way
                  off—perhaps entirely gone out of this valley.

                           Friend Greene:
                        Last Monday, at 7 A. M., we struck tents and moved five miles north. Having again encamped, disposed
                  of supper, smoked our pipes, and retired for the night, we were suddenly summoned to hasten to the
                  assistance of the 13th, who had been attacked on 'tother

                            side the mountain, leaving everything but shooting-irons and
                  ammunition behind. Off we marched at midnight, and by two A. M. had made eight miles, when halting to
                  rest, we were notified that 'twas a false alarm. Wagons with tents, baggage, and grub came up
                  and here we have been ever since.
                        To-day tents were struck, packed up, and sent off to Strausburg. All extra baggage ditto, men unable
                  to endure the fatigues of a march ditto. Company "G" sent two—John Harvey
                  and Alexander McRae.
                        I am writing in the open air by star and star-candle light, sitting on my knapsack, and using my
                  canteen for a table.
                        We are destined to reinforce McDowell, I understand, and take up our line of march eastward to-morrow
                  night.
                        I was down town to-day with Sergeant Jackson. New Market is a miserable old rookery; one sesesh store
                  (open), a jeweler's shop, post office ("in the house"), nary hotel, and a
                  very neat "skule" house in operation.
                        
                        
                           Wonderful!—Considerable excitement was manifested by the feminine
                  portion of this sesesh community. Squads of 'em (some confounded good looking ones, too,)
                  were on "dress parade." On enquiry was told that 'twas rumored the great
                  "What is It?" was in town.
                        By the way; this reminds me of a "grape-vine" that has reached camp from the Old
                  Post [
                              Vincennes
                           ], to the effect that a certain nearsighted gent, who wears gold specs and occasionally
                  rakes cat-gut for pay, being on the hunt of this same "animile," unarmed and alone,
                  was suddenly fired upon by the "pickets," and narrowly escaped a "watery
                  grave."
                        Well, I for one am rejoiced that we are off for 
                              Richmond
                           . The Fourteenth will make her mark if occasion offers. Nothing but bone, sinew, and grit
                  left now, so the rebels had better not run afoul of US. There will be some "tall"
                  marching (perhaps some fighting, too.) accomplished by this regiment before the middle of May.
                        John J. P. Blinn, for some months past acting as Assistant Adjutant General to General Kimball, has,
                  at his own request, returned to the regiment, and again resumed his duties. Thrice welcome is our
                  good-looking, gentlemanly and accomplished adjutant!
                        I send this by Joseph Roseman, Fifer of Company "G," who returns home to-morrow on
                  a thirty days' furlough.

                        On the morning of the 12th we marched over a spur of the Alleghanies,23 crossed
                  the main branch of the Shenandoah, and

                                 23 The mountain between New Market and Luray is Massanuten Mountain which
                      lies between the North and South forks of the Shenandoah. It is not a spur of the Alleghanies. The
                      South Fork of the Shenandoah occupies the valley between this mountain and the Blue Ridge.
                           
                            encamped for the night one mile east of Luray. The town, though a
                  county seat, is exceedingly diminutive and scarcely worthy of a name, though there were no lack of 
                              Virginia
                            lassies and mulatoes, decked out in gorgeous colors, to gaze upon the
                  "Yankees."
                        Tuesday, 13th, marched twenty miles—passed the night on the banks of ye Shenandoah, in the
                  rushing waters of which the 14th indulged in a general bath.
                        Wednesday, started in the rain, and marched to Front Royal,24 eight miles, where
                  we remained till Friday (May 16th) at noon, when we again "pulled out" and reached
                  the foot of the Blue Ridge, which famous mountain range we crossed at noon next day and passed the
                  night at the "Woollen Mills," 16 miles farther east.
                        Sunday, May 18th, passed through Warrenton25 (pretty women and "yallah
                  ghals" were "plenty as blackberries") and encamped four miles beyond.
                        Monday, 19th, marched through General Duryea's Camp, and stacked arms on the 
                              Orange

                                 Charlottesville
                               with Lynchburg, through which passed the railway joining 
                                 Richmond
                               and

                               with

                              , an extremely important llne during the Civil War.

                              Western Sun, July 6. 1862. Having moved Into the 
                                 Virginia
                               Piedmont during the latter part of May, the Fourteenth Indiana and other troops were
                    short back over the Blue Ridge to Luray in a very short time, They again marched to Front Royal,
                    from which point they were sent eastward a second time to participate in McClellan's
                    Peninsular campaign.
                        
                        
                        Caps, blouses, pants, drawers, shirts, socks, shoes, &c., are being distributed.
                        The paymaster is on hand and our regiment is drawing its share of "green backs and
                  shiners" from Uncle Sam—two months' pay for March and April.
                        We have an excellent camping ground—wood and water abundant, and convenient
                  weather—cool and pleasant. The boys are enjoying it hugely, and well they
                  may—none deserve clothes, food and rest more than the soldiers of Shields'28 division.
                        I received by mail yesterday two packages of the Weekly Sun. Welcome, thrice welcome news from home!

                  formerly Capt. Huey, Company B. Old Post Guards, was in camp yesterday—is a married man
                  now. He looks well.
                        The Third is one of those lucky or unlucky regiments that has never seen service—have been
                  acting as mounted patrols in and around 
                              Washington
                           , D. C. They are now attached to this division.
                        Four thousand cavalry passed through Front Royal yesterday.
                        Some of the batteries of Shields' division are being shipped on the cars to-day.
                        The "talk" is that we (the First brigade) go by rail to 
                              Alexandria
                           , but not a man in the Fourteenth believes it.
                        Major Martin has resigned and gone home, I am told.
                        Will. Dunn has not reached the regiment yet.

                           Friend Greene:
                        My last to you was written on the 18th.
                        June 19th, was a very hot day, passed the most of it "under canvas," reading a
                  novel, the pages of which were greasy enough to make soap of. In the afternoon drew a ration of
                  "lengthened sweetness, long drawn out—(i. e.,
                  "lasses")—can eat about six of 'em at one meal on "soft
                    tack"—they were of an excellent quality and duly appreciated
                  by the Fourteenth.
                        June 20th—struck tents, packed knapsacks, filled haversacks with three days'
                  rations. All of this was done in fifteen minutes' notice. We were huried up as though Jackson
                  with 150,000 rebels was within an hour's march of camp.
                        June 21st—Starting at 7 o'clock, by eleven we had "knocked off"
                  thirteen miles over one of Western 
                              Virginia
                           's roughest roads—halted here for baggage train to come up.
                        June 22nd—Off at noon; reached 
                              Salem
                            at sundown. Alf. Smith, one of the "Tiger Tail Mess", had succeeded in
                  securing a supply of 
                              
                                 28 General James Shields, earlier a Senator from 
                                    Illinois
                                 .
                              
                                 29
                                 Western Sun, July 5, 1862. The several entries in this letter were made on
                      different days while the troops were moving toward 
                                    Washington
                                 , that is, to 
                                    Alexandria
                                 .
                           
                            corn bread, fresh butter, and sweet milk. To these luxuries your
                  hungry correspondent done ample justice.
                        June 23d—The Fourteenth will not forget this day's march soon. Twenty-five miles
                  without a pause worth mentioning—day hot and sultry. At sundown a tremendous storm of wind
                  and rain burst upon us, whilst about the centre of a vast plain, no shelter of any kind. A halt was
                  called, and we "stood at ease."
                        
                        A small creek or "run" in advance soon became a raging torrent and farther progress
                  was out of the question for that day. Pity! for the two hundred of our regiment that
                  still remained in ranks felt as though they could march to hell if it was necessary—never
                  felt the want of a good horn of "Old Bourbon" so much in all my life—do
                  not think there was a man in ranks but could have "done" a pint
                  without winking. The ration of this article is not equally distributed; consequently the rank and file
                  are killing all the horses in the division by compelling them to keep up on these forced marches.
                  Their carcasses are thicker (along our line of march for two months past) than mile stones.
                        June 24th—Started early and reached this station [
                              Bristol
                           ] at noon, flanking the deep and rapid "run." Hardly had we pitched our
                  tents when another fierce storm swept over us, and the ground being low those that were not turned
                  inside out by the wind (tents I mean) were flooded by the rushing waters.
                        Michael Mullville, wounded in skirmish on Cheat Mountain—also, again at the battle of 
                              Winchester
                           , returned to duty again to-day. The "Bowery Mess," Co. G, were rejoiced
                  to meet their old messmate again.
                        David Doyle, left by us at Strausburg on the 1st of April, detailed to cook in hospital and taken
                  prisoner by Jackson, who released him on parole, came down on the train to get his
                  "muster-out," papers and some cash.
                        Our Sutler is on hand with a large stock—prices to suit the times.
                        Yours in a good humor, once again, with all the world and the rest of mankind, &c.
                        
                           PROCK.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Camp of the 14th Indiana Volunteers,
                              Four Miles North of Harrison's
                              Landing,
              James River, Advance of McClellan's Army,
                           
                           Wednesday, July 8th, [July 9th] 1862.30
                           
                        
                        
                           Friend Greene:
                        Last Sunday week [June 29th] the Fourteenth left 
                              Bristol
                            Station, O. & A. R. R., and at 1 o'clock P. M. reached 
                              Alexandria
                           , having enjoyed a short but exceedingly pleasant ride by rail of forty miles. The road
                  runs through a succession of deep ravines and extensive swamps, and the scenery is anything but
                  picturesque.
                        We lay at Manassas Junction for an hour, during which time the boys bought hot pies, ginger bread,
                  cheese, and cigars by the quantity.
                        
                           
                              30
                              Western Sun, July 19, 1862. If the letter was written on Wednesday, the date was
                    July 9th. Harrison's Landing was on the north side of the James River
                    about twenty-five or thirty miles below 
                                 Richmond
                              . The troops arrived in 
                                 Alexandria
                               on June 29, but reached Harrison's Landing on July 1. the day of the Battle of
                    Malvern Hill. Just before the seven days of fighting that ended on July 1, McClellan had made
                    Harrison's Landing his base of operations.
                        
                        
                        Slight showers during the trip only served to render it the more agreeable, although the majority of
                  us took "deck passage."
                        The train moved slowly through the city, [
                              Alexandria
                           ] affording a fine view of the place and its surroundings—forts on the one
                  hand, river and shipping on the other. Stacked arms in a small meadow; a camp guard was detailed and
                  posted, and an order issued for no man to leave camp unless for wood and water, as in all probability
                  we would ship on a transport for Fortress 
                              Monroe
                            at 4 o'clock, but men who had been outside of civilization for a twelve month
                  could not be kept in camp, and in less than an hour two-thirds of the Fourteenth were outside the
                  guard line, in search of wood and water, or climbing tall trees to get a peep at 
                              Washington City
                           .
                        Corporal James H. Simpson and a recruit joined the company here.
                        Your correspondent and the Colonel's Orderly, Rob't d'Ewald, visited the
                  town to obtain, if possible, a few ice creams, &.,—succeeded
                  admirably—the creams were deliciously cooked, and too much praise cannot be bestowed upon 
                              Alexandria
                           
                           soda water; it is "powerful strong," and I would advise all
                  friends visiting that city to partake freely thereof if they wish to obtain extensive views and
                  command the respect and admiration of the Provost Guards. "Squad, halt! What
                  division?" "None of your business, Mr. Band-box." Guards pass on, with the
                  remark— "Shields' division, I'll bet. How dirty they
                  look."
                        After disposing of an excellent dinner, washing down the crumbs with "a few more soda
                  water," we spent an hour in perambulating Zig Zag street, apparently the fashionable
                  thoroughfare. Purchased quite a curiosity in the shape of a pair of the justly celebrated frog hair
                  gloves, an article only to be duly appreciated by those who have worn 'em. Hearing the city
                  clock beating off retreat, hastened through a densely crowded street, known as the "Seventeen
                  Alleys," where you have to dodge two-horse drays, leap over hogs, dogs, wheel-barrows, and
                  slippery cellar doors, past man and wife, shut gates, walk for yards on molasses and tar barrels kick
                  nail kegs and knock impudent-looking cullod persons right and left, elbow through crowds, and squeze
                  and curse your way to camp.
                        Was just in time to march with the regiment all over town to find the pier where
                  the 
                              Columbia
                            transport lay waiting to receive us—boarded her, and with the wheel-house for
                  a pillow was soon sound asleep. At sunrise, having refreshed myself with a few drops of
                  "soda-water" from the canteen of a comrade, I established my headquarters for the
                  trip in front of the pilot house, where first sights could be obtained of the broad river, covered
                  with all manner of sailing craft.31
                        
                        
                           PROCK.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
                  31 The Fourteenth Indiana was included among troops that were transported from 
                     Alexandria
                   down the Potomac and Chesapeake Bay to Fourteenth 
                     Monroe
                   and up the James River to Harrison's Landing on the York

               A History of 
                     Spiceland
                   Academy. By Sadie Bacon Hatcher. Indiana Historical Society (Publications, XI, No. 2), 
                  Indianapolis
               , 1934. Pp. 174, fifty cents.
            
               
                  Spiceland
                Academy in 
                  Henry County
                was one of the best known academies in Indiana. This history of the institution deals with its
          work from the opening in 1826 to the end of its existence in 1921. The principal aspects treated are:
          curriculum, finance, extra-curricular activities, and the human side of the academy. The study bears evidence
          of careful scrutiny of the available source material and is therefore a valuable contribution to the history
          of academies in Indiana.
            This particular institution needs to be viewed in relation to the growth of academies in the country as a
          whole. The first academies were established in some of the eastern states about 1750, and, at the time of the
          founding of the school at 
                  Spiceland
               , there were about 6,000 of them throughout the country.
            
               
                  Spiceland
                seems to have been representative of many of the academies of the period. It was fostered by a
          religious sect—the Friends—although it appears that the authorities freely admitted
          students who were not Friends. Like many other academies 
                  Spiceland
                was supported by tuition fees and donations. In 1872 an endowment fund was started, which finally
          amounted to $30,700. Toward the end, however, the institution was aided quite extensively by public
          support in the form of tuition fees.
            The curricula of various periods are given, but there is nothing to show from what sources ideas on
          curriculum making were obtained or indeed from what sources the educational philosophy of the institution was
          derived. Apparently the secondary curriculum was rather limited until 1860, for Latin and history were not
          offered until about that time. By the decade of the 1870's, the public high school movement, which
          began in 1821, was attaining importance. Inspection of the secondary curricula of 
                  Spiceland
                for this period leads one to infer that the institution was influenced on the one hand by the
          waning academy movement (especially the church-sponsored sector), and on the other hand by the youthful public
          high schools. The development of the elementary department appears to have been quite definitely influenced by
          the public  elementary schools which were just emerging as real graded
          schools.
            Though teacher-training was begun in the academies of 
                  New York State
                in the 1820s and had become quite general by the 1840s, 
                  Spiceland
                first undertook teacher-training in 1864-5, and "the details of the Normal Course were
          not definitely listed until 1874" (page 128). By this time colleges and normal schools were rapidly
          replacing the academies as teacher-training institutions. By way of summary, therefore, it may be said that
          for a few decades 
                  Spiceland
                Academy filled a real need, but the causes of its demise were at work before it was well started.
            Several miscellaneous points of interest will be noted. It is recorded that in 1845 the Indiana Yearly
          Meeting of Friends chose a uniform list of textbooks for schools under their jurisdiction. This step seems to
          have been in advance of the current practice of that time. The lists of textbooks in use, including
          McGuffey's readers and Ray's arithmetics, indicate that the work of the academy was
          excellent according to the standards of the times.
            Studies by L. V. Koos and others have shown that as secondary schools developed in this country, there was a
          tendency to transfer subjects formerly taught in college to the secondary level. Evidently 
                  Spiceland
               's curriculum exemplifies this for the author says: "A review of the courses
          offered as high school work makes the reader wonder if this was not a college rather than a high
          school" (p. 123).
            It is a tribute to the work of 
                  Spiceland
                Academy that in its best period it drew students from not only many Indiana counties, but also
          from 
                  North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Kentucky
               , and 
                  Kansas
               . There were several hundred graduates, of whom the names and addresses are given in an appendix
          of the study under review. The list includes the names of several persons who have attained national
          reputations.
            Interesting sections on extra-curricular activities and on the human side of the academy are given. Several
          of the superintendents are given brief mention. It is unfortunate that the author did not find it possible to
          include material on the personal characteristics and educational philosophies of these men, especially such
          matter relative to Clarkson Davis,  who seems to have been the outstanding
          superintendent of 
                  Spiceland
                Academy during the comparatively brief life of the institution.

               Episcopal Bishops in Indiana. By Sarah S. Pratt. The Pratt Foster Company, 
                  Indianapolis
               , 1934. Pp. 83, illustrated.
            The sub-title of this small, paper-bound volume is, "A Churchwoman's Retrospect",
          and the brief life sketches of the several Indiana Bishops treated are mainly based on the recollections of
          the author. Recognizing the large numbers and the wide-spread efforts of Methodists, Baptists and other sects
          in pioneer Indiana, and giving generous credit for the successes won by them, Mrs. Pratt nevertheless finds it
          possible to write a charming story of the work of Episcopalians in the state.
            Having spent her childhood in 
                  Delphi
               , the author refers often to St. Mary's Church of that beautiful, little county seat.
          After a short chapter devoted to "A Growing Interest in Missions", each of nine bishops is
          given a chapter. There is a biographical sketch of each of the following bishops: Jackson Kemper, George
          Upfold, Cruikshank Talbot, David Buell Knickerbocker, John Hazen White, and John Marshall Francis. The last
          named, Bishop Francis is still in active service as head of the Diocese of 
                  Indianapolis
               . There is another in the state, the second being called the Diocese of Northern Indiana, with 
                  Mishawaka
                as the See city.
            The last three chapters of the book are headed "Woman's Auxiliary", "The
          Old Guard", and "Conclusion". In the "Old Guard", Mrs. Pratt
          places five Episcopal clergymen with long records in various Indiana parishes. The list includes: the Rev.
          John E. Sulger (St. Stephen's, 
                  Terre Haute
               ); the Rev. Lewis 
                  Brown
                (
                  St. Paul
               's, 
                  Indianapolis
               ); the Rev. James D. Stanley (Christ Church, 
                  Indianapolis
               ); the Rev. George Graham Burbanck (
                  St. Paul
               's, 
                  Richmond
               ); and the Rev. William Burrows (Trinity Church, 
                  Bloomington
               , and Diocesan Archdeacon, 
                  Indianapolis
               ). Of these five, the Rev. Stanley died in 1928, and the Rev. Sulger in 1929.
            The little volume presents a picture of each member of the "Old Guard" and one of each of
          the bishops treated. The frontispiece is a reproduction of a snap-shot of All Saints'  Cathedral (
                  Indianapolis
               ) which was taken in the winter time. The book is well-written and well-printed. It will be read
          with interest and enjoyment not only by Episcopalians but by others who appreciate the many different threads
          which must be woven together to make up the pattern of history.

            Comment
            While statesmen, captains of industry, writers, clergymen, lawyers, and educators were planning, organizing,
          working for the interests of society or for themselves, explaining economic, social and political conditions,
          and foretelling future developments during the last half century, powerful forces were in operation that were
          to confound the most vigorous minds among them all. The increase in labor-saving machinery, the application of
          new scientific knowledge to production, and the creation of an intricate and colossal financial
          structure—these were to determine the social system and set the problems of today. Policies of
          government, enactments of legislative bodies, and educational efforts were all to pale into comparative
          insignificance when the results of invention, scientific production, and high finance came to fruition.
            Will history repeat itself? Will industrialists, statesmen, and leaders among the professional classes, again
          plan, organize, teach their doctrines, and once more fail to appreciate or understand the forces at work which
          are really to determine what the next generation is to face? Who can say? Certainly the question is
          fundamental, and it would seem that, unless the present system is to be utterly abandoned, there must be
          established an effective control of invention and scientific processes as related to production, together with
          a complete rebuilding of the financial structure.
            At every turn, we read or hear that people will have more leisure time from this day forward. That there will
          be from now on a great army of unemployed even under the best conditions in every industrial country is
          another pronouncement so frequently made that it is no longer challenged. Fewer hours per day, shorter weeks,
          and longer vacations, retirement at sixty or earlier, unemployment insurance, old age pensions—some
          or all of these are the common suggestions offered to reduce the miseries of unemployment, while a vast amount
          of advice as to the best ways to use leisure time has been evolved and furnished to those believed to need it.
          The effort to determine what can best be done with and for our surpluses of old people and young people and
          middle-aged people is laudable. It is good and necessary as long as the surpluses remain with us, and much of
          the effort will prove to  be permanently valuable, but the general
          assumption behind it may be unsound.
            If society accepts the work of blind forces as inevitable, we may have increasing leisure and increasing
          unemployment, but it is not at all impossible that periods may come when leisure for most people will be too
          rare and unemployment practically unknown. Is there not much validity in the contention that, when all people
          are supplied with the goods and services necessary to their well-being, there will be sufficient work for all?
          It will be unwise indeed to deny or ignore such a possibility merely because of the long and severe economic
          breakdown of recent years.
            It is a trite saying that no person is so important that his place can not be filled when he passes on. That
          the world will go on is very true, but always some people can not carry on as before. In some instances,
          men's places are not filled, and the general public loses for an indefinite period. Many examples
          taken from different periods of history could be cited as proof. Not to leave Indiana nor to go very far back
          in time, who has come forward to fill the places of Kin Hubbard or Chic Jackson? Their work is not being done
          and life is worth less than it was before their departure.
            At the present writing, Americans, to say nothing of the rest of mankind, are in great confusion. Fortunately
          some of it will quickly evaporate after the Tuesday following the first Monday in November. Reactionaries have
          seemingly convinced themselves that it is only necessary to relinquish all efforts to ameliorate conditions in
          order to restore prosperity and happiness. Extreme radicals are certain that every move short of complete
          revolution will only make matters worse. Are there enough Americans who will steadfastly support a reasonable
          amount of experimentation? If so, are there enough real and wise experimenters who will not quit too soon?
          These are questions that can be answered later.
