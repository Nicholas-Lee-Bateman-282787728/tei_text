            Leroy Glass's October 30, 1915, journal entry shows that the freshman had lived a model
                    Purdue University student life to that point. During the previous weeks he had enjoyed his first
                    college football game, received his Reserve Officer Training Corps uniform, attended Sunday services
                    at the "Westside church," and spent extra time "in Dairy." The
                    first day of November brought a change. He skipped church (and never recorded attending services
                    again), and went riding in a "ford" along the 
                        Wabash
                    , continuing through both Happy Hollow Park and 
                        Lafayette
                     before returning to his boarding house where he "studied Sunday
                    night." Glass's second entry illustrates his acculturation to early
                    twentieth-century student life—a metamorphosis that spoke to a grander change occurring
                    at Purdue. In the first two decades of the twentieth century, Purdue students helped transform the
                    institution from a small Indiana technical college to a university on the cusp of growth and
                        prestige.1
            
            The process hardly took place in a vacuum. The massive social, cultural, political, and economic
                    reorganization that linked once-disparate communities in a network of shared
                    standards—what Alan Trachtenberg has called the "incorporation of
                    America"—fundamentally changed the way people saw the world around them. Robert
                    Wiebe, using the example of the American Medical Association, outlined this process in The Search for Order, 1877-1920. In the early nineteenth century, the AMA grew in
                    membership and authority. Its prestige enabled the organization to establish national standards of
                    professional medical practice that greatly enhanced public trust in physicians. As it had in the
                    professions, modernization in nearly every facet of American life redefined everything from clothing
                    and entertainment

                     period President Winthrop Stone worked to define the school as a
                    place that produced service-minded men and women who spread the gospel of progress throughout
                    Indiana and the Midwest. As the students, by contrast, focused on the social side of their
                    development— often against the wishes of campus administrators—they
                    articulated a quite different college culture. Ultimately, in the creation of two campus facilities,
                    the Memorial Gymnasium and the Memorial Student Union, official and student culture found common
                    ground on which to realize their visions of a modern Purdue.
            That students and administrators managed to protect separate interests had historical precedent in
                    nineteenth-century higher education. Antebellum colleges limited courses of study within sectarian
                    environments to affirm existing knowledge and create moral men. Students wishing to learn anything
                    outside of the traditional philosophy-and-religion curriculum created campus societies toward those
                    ends. Even as higher education changed after the Civil War, these separate student and
                    administrative spheres remained. The movements to recreate colleges into universities and to
                    establish new institutions (the latter resulting in Purdue) pushed learning toward technological and
                    secular education. But for all the talk of reform, the people who created universities did little to
                    bridge the gap between students and faculty. Universities featured specialized classes that
                    encouraged professors to interact with a minority of interested students. Campus life away from the
                    classroom continued to provide what the official culture could not. Despite the introduction of
                    women into universities, extracurricular education remained male-dominated and fraught with illicit
                    pleasures such as smoking, drinking, and lewd behavior. While rough and seemingly frivolous, student
                    culture pursued serious goals. Its followers expected young men to "do" something,
                    whether to join a literary society, edit the newspaper, or play on varsity or class athletic teams.
                    These endeavors served as a shadow classroom that taught participants the social strategies needed
                    in the real world, where whom one knew mattered as much as what
                    one knew.3
            
            Once Progressive Era university leaders decided to remake their institutions, the relationship
                    between the "real classroom" and the "shadow classroom" became
                    the focal point of conflict between faculty and students. Reformers such as Winthrop Stone worked to
                    redefine the university as a place that developed students who worked for a common social good.
                    Their efforts, colliding head on with the students' own initiatives to update their
                    culture, created the twentieth-century university.4

            As Purdue's leader, Stone undertook the responsibility of training engineers and scientific
                    farmers who would return to their Hoosier communities and advance the transition to modern America.
                    An institutional legacy of struggle made this a daunting task. Former president James Smart, who
                    took office in 1883, had faced an inadequate budget and meager facilities as he worked to build an
                    impressive technical college. When Stone succeeded Smart in 1900, his first concerns were to
                    maintain the engineering school's instruction and personnel, to encourage the growth of the
                    agricultural department, and to integrate women into the university. Yet scholars characterize his
                    administration as a time of limited expansion and progress. The roots of both men's
                    accomplishments, and of their difficulties, lay in the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862.5
            
            The Morrill Act established a system of land-grant colleges to educate scientific agriculturalists,
                    miners, engineers, progressive housewives, home economics teachers, and military officers. The
                    federal government appropriated start-up funds, then entrusted the state governments with the
                    operation of the colleges. States established institutions and appointed experts in agricultural and
                    mechanical fields to run the schools and train their students. Land-grant universities held
                    responsibilities outside of the classroom, including conducting research to improve technology, and
                    working through extension programs to educate the general population in scientific agriculture.
                    Graduates taught in local high schools and extension services.6
            
            The act granted university presidents the freedom to determine the nature of their respective
                    schools. Their individual efforts coalesced into what Stone and others called the "new
                    university"; it integrated basic liberal arts with a scientific education and specific
                    research to prepare leaders who, it was hoped, would reform corporate America and provide clean
                    government. It taught students to look at their life's work as a part of a larger effort to
                    strengthen society, culture, and politics via the construction of associations with other
                    like-minded individuals—something Stone called the "Purdue Spirit."
                    This, he argued, required the replacement of the family farmer and independent businessman by
                    scientific professionals.7

            In pursuing his objectives Stone depended on state funding for more buildings. Three things kept him
                    from looking outside of the chain of command for support. First, since the Morrill Act obligated the
                    university to serve the citizenry, responsibility to fund this effort fell to the state government.
                    Second, he eschewed private contributions from big business for academic buildings because he feared
                    that companies might use such gifts as leverage to influence men and women in the interest of
                    private gain, not public service. As future public servants, Purdue graduates had to be taught to
                    act with society's best interest in mind, not the corporation's. Third, even if he
                    wanted to solicit the alumni for funds, he did not have much of a pool on which to draw. Aside from
                    its small size, the young alumni population had not yet accumulated wealth.8
            
            Stone's background also influenced the environment he tried to create at Purdue. Observers
                    pointed to his 
                        New Hampshire
                     upbringing and education in 
                        Massachusetts
                     to explain his somewhat austere personality. Many people compared him to another
                    northeast-erner of his time, Calvin Coolidge. A renowned chemist, Stone first came to Purdue in 1889
                    as a professor. He had been trained at 
                        Massachusetts
                     Agricultural College, itself a land-grant school, and received his graduate education
                    at the University of Gottingen. Like many other American academics of his generation, he absorbed
                    the ideals of the German university system, which emphasized objective standards of research and
                        teaching.9
            
            Stone maintained that Purdue's mission was to cultivate an atmosphere that transformed young
                    people into society's intellectual and moral leaders. He assumed personal responsibility
                    for as many decisions concerning the operation of the school as possible, from advising incoming
                    students to making sure that the new piano in

                     Fowler Hall be used only for official functions. He established
                    a clear set of regulations for his charges that directed them toward his idea of the modern
                    university while allowing for both traditional and progressive ideas of citizenship and society.10
            
            Stone inculcated his values in students from the moment they arrived on campus. He told the class of
                    1917 at the beginning of their freshman year that "Entering upon a college course is one of
                    the great events in life. It destroys the home relations and home supervision which the student has
                    previously known, calls for the exercise of self-reliance and the assumption of new
                        responsibilities."11 This new identity as a college student
                    required undergraduates to take on university work, maintain their health, and develop sound morals.
                    It necessitated breaking old ties with their hometowns and families and establishing relationships
                    within the framework of university life before returning to their communities to spread the gospel
                    of "the Purdue Spirit." To aid their development as civic leaders, Stone urged
                    undergraduates to embrace the "new education" and the social gospel. The former
                    married scientific education to the liberal arts, while the latter encouraged students to look
                    beyond their personal desires and pursue social progress. He also advised them to submit to divine
                    authority and to seek personal perfection. Students had to accept individual responsibility for
                    their education. To accomplish this, they needed to acquire the moral traits of an ideal Victorian:
                    self-restraint, belief in delayed gratification, and Protestant values. Toward this end, Stone
                    believed that students must develop seven essential habits: an orderly routine, concentration,
                    industriousness (innovation), punctuality, timeliness (finishing work on schedule), respectful
                    relations with professors, and elimination of the "non-essentials" of the college
                        world.12
            
            Stone's views on student leisure reflected a similar outlook. Joining organizations that
                    allowed a student to "march in step" with like-minded individuals and to
                    "assume command of himself and of his affairs," Stone believed, softened the wear
                    of academic routine

                     on the student's soul. Implied boundaries restricted
                    these pursuits; he encouraged students to pursue lofty ideas by participating in musical groups and
                    literary societies, and by patronizing the recently constructed Eliza Fowler Hall for education in
                    the fine arts. He hoped to erect a new gymnasium to help students become stronger through physical
                        Culture.1
            
            The students' preference for athletics, fraternities, and the bars of 
                        Lafayette
                     frustrated Stone beyond endurance. Time and again, he rebuked them at mandatory chapel
                    meetings, convocations, or in his office. He acquired a reputation for railing against everything
                    from cheating in the classroom to what he perceived as an unhealthy emphasis on football. He allowed
                    that students could have fun but complained that they oRen went beyond respectable limits and
                    created far-reaching problems for society. Football hoopla was singled out for special rebuke:
                    "At present much of the evils of athletics, particularly football, comes from the popular
                    interest in the game which tacitly encourages winning at any cost, and contributes to the
                    spectacular enthusiasm at the contests. The student body and the team in the absence of any strong
                    dominating college spirit and sentiment yield to the popular influence."14 Stone argued that the rash of deaths in football games nationwide and the ill effects of
                    football weekends at Purdue— brawls, drunkenness, and property damage—had
                    nothing to do with the game itself, but with the spirit in which football games took place. Time and
                    again he explained to the students the danger into which they put not only themselves but the
                    university when they strayed from his path to success.15 How, he asked, could
                    any student anticipate gainful employment ahr graduation, or expect the state to appropriate more
                    funds for improving the campus with this association? Nevertheless, the situation grew so dire that 
                        Lafayette
                     citizens assumed any young man seen intoxicated in public came from Purdue.16
            
            Stone's collected papers indicate that by 1915 he had stopped criticizing the student body
                    for its behavior and instead concentrated on improving the Agnculture Department. Had he finally won
                    students over to his way of thinking? Anyone familiar with the image of bawdy college life in the
                    1920s might be dubious. Instead, students and administrators at Purdue found the
                    means—particularly through two memorializing efforts—to relate their divergent
                    cultures without either side surrendering its historically distinct sense of identity. In

                     order to understand this shift, it is important first to
                    understand student life as it had developed up to that time.17
            
            Turn-of-the-century Hoosier teenagers, more so than their parents, felt they could readily sever ties
                    to the land and their families. Although Indiana remained a rural state, increasing numbers of young
                    men and women flocked to factories in the state's largest cities: 
                  Indianapolis, Evansville
               , and Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . Others left home to pursue an education at Indiana State Normal, Purdue University, or
                    Indiana University. These schools underwent greater changes than the state's private
                    schools because they were more responsive to the vocational aspirations of the state's
                    college-age population.18 Like the other two state schools, Purdue suffered
                    growing pains. Between the beginning of Stone's administration in 1900 and 1924 enrollment
                    soared from 400 to more than 3,000. The overwhelming majority of these students came from Indiana.
                    Furthermore, almost 90 percent came from small towns or rural areas.19
            
            At the turn of the century, universities remained predominantly male environments, featuring drinking
                    parties, poker games, and hazing. These pastimes provided a trial by fire that transformed boys into
                    men while serving as a respite from the "real world," which ended with
                    graduation—although alumni weekends let them revisit the scene of their revelry. College
                    provided a place where youths let off steam and readied themselves for adult responsibilities. And
                    while the precise relationship between student culture and official university culture changed
                    continually, what Laurence Veysey calls "the gulf between students and faculty"
                    remained a constant.20
            
            The Old Dormitory served as the physical setting for student interaction at Purdue. The Association
                    of Dorm Devils (AODD) subjected underclass dormitory residents to hazing within its walls. Typical
                    stunts involved stripping neophytes and shaving their entire bodies, raiding packages sent from
                    home, and organizing "night shirt

                parades." The AODD lost its lair in 1903 when Stone converted the building into
                    classrooms. From then until the 1920s, men attending Purdue lived off campus in fraternity houses,
                    boarding houses, or at home. The Dorm Devils got the last laugh on Stone by printing a photograph in
                    the university's yearbook, the Debris, of a nude youth kneeling in front
                    of a row of AODD members holding him down with pitchforks as an inked-in Satan looked on. The
                    devils, as a group, managed to last until the 1960s.21
            
            Like the men, Purdue women did not always live up to the administration's standards.
                    Ladies' Hall, the women's dormitory, saw many of the same kind of pranks that the
                    Old Dorm did. Girls blew on gas outlets in their rooms to extinguish the flames in other rooms where
                    friends studied, and they dunked at least one freshman into a tub to impress upon her the humble
                    role she ought to assume. They skipped classes just as their male counterparts did, and when in the
                    classroom they did not always focus on books. Debris editors claimed, for example,
                    that if coed Carrie Richardson were to have written a book, "The Influence of Sidelong
                    Glances in Winning the Sterner Sex" would have made an apt title.22

            When May Caulkins earned her bachelor of science degree in 1900, after a student career marked by the
                    presidency of clubs ranging from the YWCA to the Philalethean literary society and a role as the
                    class historian, a woman's place on campus had not yet been restricted by Stone's
                    plans for female education. In 1905, he established a home economics school and in 1908 an education
                    department. Female students took general science courses and had already shunned one attempt to
                    establish a "cooking school" before these modifications. Stone's desire
                    to train progressive housewives for Indiana's male farmers and competent public school
                    teachers for its burgeoning public school system fueled this change. Women infiltrated science and
                    engineering courses on occasion but for the most part found themselves segregated from men in the
                    classroom. The process helped Purdue men continue to guard their right jealously to define the
                    student culture as a whole.23
            
            College life taught young men to live away from parental control, to defeat competitors, and to claim
                    independence from authority. The close-knit groups youths joined taught them violent, ungentlemanly
                    behavior, as well as to oppose authority. Such a sentiment was reflected in a poem composed by
                    Simeon "Sim" Miller for his fraternity brothers in 1906: 
                        Get the clear out of here
                        You damned old fool
                        Kiss my ass you bastard dean ….
                     Student rowdiness had a long history across the country; its destructive veneer masked a
                    need for purpose and structure. An editor of the student newspaper, the Exponent,
                    pointed to "certain unwritten laws which have become binding through long continued usage
                    by all classes or preceding classes, [and] should be observed by all."25 The student body, a majority of whom came from Indiana or nearby midwestern states, looked
                    to memories of pioneer forefathers to explain their actions. When they bragged about the originality
                    of customs at "Old Purdue" or referred to nonexistent or exaggerated differences
                    between their practices and those of other schools, they drew from a perception of what it meant to
                    be a Hoosier pioneer. By claiming a unique heritage, they defied Stone and explained away their bad
                        behavior.26

            This delinquent behavior served as more than an outlet for students; it ordered their school year and
                    introduced new initiates to the rhythms of university life. "According to
                    tradition," the class of 1911 noted in its scrapbook, "the 'varsity
                    steam' was reduced last night to normal pressure. Now for the work of getting an education
                    … [any more] differences … should [be settled] on the football
                        field."27 The editors of the 1910 Debris
                    expressed a belief in the organic nature of this process when they announced that "the law
                    of college customs is [as] inexorable as the laws of chemistry or physics."28 The seeming chaos of undergraduate life at Purdue functioned within a structure of
                    order—some of it, at least, self-imposed. Students "made"
                    Purdue's existence, argued senior John Larkin, and deserved the right to construct a
                    student government: 
                        Some say that our freshmen would not respect the laws of student government, that they would
                            not submit to being governed by another student. This is false. Even while at Purdue, the
                            student is governed by the higher laws of our country, by the laws of our state, and so
                            minutely sifted to the laws of our town …. There is no such thing as
                            independence. Every being, directly or indirectly is dependent on some other one.29
                  
                    
            
            Larkin's call for social responsibility echoed Stone's and suggests that students
                    felt the influences of America's incorporation without the president's prompting.
                    By 1900, for instance, the Purdue Athletic Association (PAA) had existed for over a decade. This
                    student organizing of campus life grew over the next two decades to the point that Stone assumed
                    that student culture had converged with the responsible administrative culture he fsstered.30

            Purdue students were taught early to value competition for its own sake. As they stepped off the
                    train in 
                        Lafayette
                    , they could see a large black water tower which had a class's numerals painted
                    on it in large white letters. The tradition of painting a class's year on the tank began in
                    the spring of 1895. In the preceding years classes had painted these dates on different class
                    buildings or flew female-stitched banners from the Mechanical Tower, only to see them removed the
                    next day by Stone's orders. That year's sophomores distinguished themselves by
                    painting their numerals on the tank, which was located off campus, though it proved a temporary
                    statement of class superiority. Soon after "'97" appeared on the tank,
                    the freshmen turned it into a "98." The entering undergrads took up the challenge
                    the next fall, and their efforts to protect their turf led to a fight between about twenty members
                    of each class that lasted until nearly dawn.31
            
            The annual "Tank Scrap," like the "color rush" at the University
                    of 
                        Illinois
                    , grew in seriousness and organization over the next few years as the swelling campus
                    population brought more participants and spectators. Juniors goaded freshmen into painting the tank
                    under the cover of darkness during the first month of school. Sophomores always managed to hear of
                    it and appear at "tank scrap hill" in time to rush down the slope and into the
                    charging freshman ranks, with seniors watching over them as marshals. The class whose numbers
                    appeared on the tank at daybreak of the first football game of the year earned the privilege of
                    keeping them up until the next fall. By 1902, the winners roped up the losing team and marched them
                    downtown to perform a series of humiliating stunts that provided amusement for spectators;
                    approximately 500 youths participated in 1903. The students, whose exploits attracted negative
                    attention from Stone and the press, took it upon themselves to push for reforms in order to preserve
                    the event. The Exponent commented that if "some one could suggest a plan
                    whereby this [danger] might be eliminated, it would render the affair comparatively
                        unobjectionable."32 The violence of the Tank Scrap forced student
                    leaders to explain and justify it as a way to release coltish energy in freshmen and sophomores
                    before settling into the rigors of schoolwork. An Exponent writer expressed the
                    ritual's usefulness as a path to self-discovery by asserting that "the veil has
                    for a moment been lifted aside, and the [participant] has seen himself in a truer light…
                    a few have been humiliated by

                     the discovery."33 None of this
                    bothered the class of 1904, whose members repainted their numerals on the tank upon returning to
                    campus for Gala Week in 1907.34
            
            Despite such efforts, Stone outlawed the scrap in 1908, forcing the students to take Mher steps to
                    reform the event. Once reinstated— on the promise of orderliness—the fight
                    underwent a number of changes until it ended in 1913. Its spontaneity dissipated as an effort was
                    made to control the violence. The senior class organized a committee to oversee the scrap by meeting
                    with the underclassmen ahead of schedule and educating them on the rituals and how to fight. Instead
                    of a series of skirmishes leading up to the main event, upperclassmen designated a night for the
                    event, gave the underclassmen instructions on how to scrap, and led them to the field. Where,
                    before, the juniors and seniors played semiofficial roles, they now assumed assigned duties that
                    gave them the responsibility of insuring that the event came off cleanly. They also led inspections
                    of participants for weapons or hard-soled shoes, and assigned doctors to each camp to aid the
                    injured. Students who believed that reforms had rendered the scrap "a clean, manly fight,
                    but still a fight which requires brain, brawn, and nerve to win," applauded. Despite these
                    precautions, sophomore Francis Oberchain collapsed while running down the tank scrap hill to meet
                    the oncoming freshmen and died in the fall of 1913. The cause of death was shrouded in mystery. The
                    coroner's report listed a heart attack as the official cause, but in popular memory he died
                    of a broken neck.35 The students met the next day and voted to discontinue
                    scraps. The tank stood with the class of 1917's numerals as a reminder of the sad event
                    until 1922, when students helped the waterworks company paint the tank white.36
            
            Student culture did not always rely on violence to express its values. At many universities and
                    colleges, students marked the end of their academic careers and entrance into adulthood with book
                    burnings, mock funerals, and trials. Students at the University of 
                        California
                     at Berkeley, for instance, held a "Bourdon and Minto funeral" in
                    which

                            other sources claimed he died of a broken neck. Pearl Coggshell recalled in 1979 that she
                            had heard after she left Purdue that the sophomore had broken his neck. Robert Topping
                            reported the same in his history of the university in 1988, as did the Reamer Club in its
                            history of Purdue traditions, published in 1989. Perhaps this popular memory stems from the
                            need to show how bad the accident was to push the student body to give up the tradition
                            voluntarily. Pearl Coggshell, "Story of Pearl Coggshell's Stay at Purdue

                     they laid to rest the charred remains of textbooks belonging to
                    two Students.37 The "Mechanic's Burning" at Purdue,
                    an annual mock funeral in the spring, commemorated the senior civil engineering students'
                    completion of study, provided an opportunity for one last schoolboy prank, and gave students the
                    opportunity to criticize their professors and the university.38
            
            While book burnings appeared on campus as early as 1891, the ritual of the Mechanic's
                    Burning did not take solid shape until 1903. The first recorded "last sad rites"
                    involved the seniors' burning a mechanical engineering textbook in front of Fowler Hall and
                    making speeches about the need to cheat in order to pass the course. They collected the ashes left
                    over from the fire and, as a salute was fired, presented them to the junior class president. In the
                    following years the event assumed the characteristics of a church service, which grew rowdy enough
                    to prompt Stone to forbid the seniors from holding it in Fowler Hall. They moved the service to the
                    armory and the burning to Stuart Field. Problems arose when freshmen locked out for lack of space
                    tried to force their way into the ceremony.39
            
            By 1907, the ceremony was changed by placing an effigy of "I.P. Church" or some
                    other fictional corpse into a casket. The class conducted a mock funeral, reading a eulogy and
                    asking the crowd to participate in a congregational response, much like a real church service. The
                        Exponent asked the ritual's detractors to look beyond its
                    "sacrilegious" elements and recognize it as "an ebullition of the
                    superfluous spirit of youth—perhaps the last in the student's
                        lifetime."40 Prior to the "service," the
                    "body" lay in wake at a local off-campus hangout called Pa Townsley's.
                    After a week's viewing, the senior class bore the casket to the armory with a procession
                    featuring floats and outrageous costumes. At one point in the ceremony a horned devil pushed back
                    the lid of the casket and leapt out to chastise those among the underclassmen who acted like
                    "roughs," "scabs," or "goats." Two seniors
                    forced the devil back into the casket and bore it away to Stuart Field, where they burned it and
                    fired volleys with the ROTC's cannon in honor of "Church." The most
                    important part of the day may have been the seniors' chance to accuse the professors of
                    trying to flunk as many of them as possible.41
            
            Changes in the Mechanic's Burning predated the Tank Scrap's demise. Efforts of each
                    class to outdo its immediate predecessor made

                     each enactment more extravagant. This, along with the growing
                    interest in the ceremony from outside the class, necessitated a stronger hierarchy to plan and
                    execute the day's festivities. In the effort to innovate, maintain interest, and pacify the
                    faculty who found its content offensive, the Mechanic's Burning committee decided to
                    substitute a mock trial for the funeral, charging "I.P.C. Mechanics" and
                    "M.M. Hydraulics" with "crimes against humanity." The result was
                    "a real holiday affair in which good natured take offs on persons and things about the
                    university are the main feature."42 The new ceremony jettisoned the
                    sacrilegious elements of the event and kept its meaning for the students, letting them seek
                    retribution for the "crimes" the faculty had committed. The Exponent ran stories for weeks preceding the trial, publicizing a fictitious posse in pursuit
                    of Hydraulics and Mechanics—a trope that represented the seniors' last weeks of
                    course work. When the seniors finished their studies, the paper announced that the two
                    "bandits" had been captured at last and that a trial would follow shortly. The
                    effigies were put on display in a jail guarded by class members. Bailiffs paraded them to the Stuart
                    Field court and, amidst fanfare and revelry, on the appointed day a jury sentenced them to death or
                    permanent incarceration. This new act lasted only until 1913, when a band of seniors kidnapped the
                    malefactors in the middle of the hearing and lynched them.43
            
            The changing role of women at Purdue affected the Mechanic's Burning and the nature of
                    campus life in general. The senior class in 1914 built on a tradition that had come to accompany the
                    parade— a holdover from its representation as a funeral—and organized a circus
                    and May Day celebration. May Day was observed by electing a queen and presenting an interpretive
                    dance by some of the university's female students. In the years after the turn of the
                    century, student culture came to accept women in a limited role on campus—as long as the
                    role was subordinate. "Knew nothing about the sport [football] so was careful to yell only
                    when my escort did," reported Pearl Coggshell when she recalled attending her first
                    football game with a date. Her demeanor at this event shows what male students looked for in a coed.
                    Coggshell also witnessed the 1912 Tank Scrap, recalling that "it was very impressive as the
                    juniors and seniors lighted the big field where it was held by holding big torches. Seemed like
                    [what] I imagined Roman battles looked."44 The acceptance of women on
                    campus grew clearer when the editors of the Debris answered their own query,
                    "does co-education pay[?]," by printing photos of young lovers in romantic scenes

            The transition to a mixed-gender campus did not proceed smoothly, as the men of the university showed
                    ambivalence toward the "co-ed's" place on campus as late as 1919. They
                    argued that as long as there were only "some" women, things might improve.
                    "Morale would be better … there would be no manless dance," the Debris stated, adding, "some sisters could show less aristocracy and more
                    'pep' … the Seniors could even have tight corduroy skirts to keep up
                    the pace of fashion."46 In short, if women assimilated into student
                    life "correctly," they might benefit men by becoming sex objects. Not all Purdue
                    women accepted this role or played by the rules that student or official culture set for them. On
                    one occasion, they managed to set the Ladies' Hall roof on fire during an after-hours
                    party. Stone found that he had a hard time justifying his claims about the efficacy of his
                    educational plan when a female freshman sued a group of upperclassmen in 1915 for stripping her
                    naked, pouring mucilage down her back, and painting "her breasts, neck, head, and back with
                    red ink.47
            
            The "fair co-ed was successfully assimilated, and Purdue became a heterosocial world.48 When women no longer threatened the nature of student culture, they were
                    accepted as sex objects. "We will stack up our co-eds as the best looking in
                    school," bragged the class of 1922.49 Even so, women managed to assume
                    important roles in student government and leadership, as long as they worked within boundaries that
                    male culture allowed. When they pushed the limits, males quickly voiced concern. The editors of the
                    1919 Debris, for instance, asked "where do the co-eds get all these
                    "P" sweaters?"50 The assignment of the Purdue
                    "P" for athletic achievement or student service had been the privilege of the
                    male-run PAA and student government for over a decade. Despite their misgivings, men seemed unable
                    to stem the women's progress in claiming power on campus. The upperclassmen pointed out in
                    1919 that never before had women risen to such prominent roles in student government. They served as
                    class officers, took control of the most important social events, and joined the

            Male students continued to dominate student culture even as the number of women on campus increased,
                    in part by exerting social pressure to confine women to traditional roles. Expanding the sorority

                     also supported separate gender roles for women. Fraternities,
                    for their part, likewise grew in number during the second half of Stone's tenure. The
                    allure of an all-male circle to provide camaraderie remained important for Purdue's men,
                    especially as women joined the student culture. Women occasionally took exception to the masculine
                    character of that culture. One offended alumna complained about the Purdue
                    Alumnus's use of the term "fellows" when addressing the student
                    body. The editors defended themselves by stating that there existed no acceptable unisex pronouns to
                    employ when speaking to the Purdue body and that she should not feel excluded from calls to support
                    the alumni association's new magazine.52
            
            Student life at Purdue came increasingly to emphasize material success, in contrast to
                    Stone's vision of graduates who would act in society's best interest. The new
                    Purdue man resembled Sinclair Lewis's fictional character Ted Babbitt, eschewing academic
                    pursuits and communal values for sociability, fast cars, and conspicuous consumption. Looking back
                    over his first semester with fondness, Leroy Glass noted in his diary on December 6, 1915, 
                        When I return home people ask me what I learn and how much I learn … to my mind
                            this is but a small part of what is to be gained in college life.
                    
               53
            
            Clubs offered students several options in deciding how to "be a man." Should a
                    student assume the role of an athlete, intellectual, independent, or fraternity man? The decision
                    also determined how an individual fit into the student body. By 1921, class histories included in
                    the Debris argued about which class best understood the idea of corporate
                    membership. By 1924, each claimed that they had come to support and represent a "greater
                    Purdue." Social groups reflected this change by joining together as a corporate entity with
                    a single representative to the student government.54
            
            Even though student culture grew more responsible, its conflicts with officialdom continued. Students
                    still criticized Stone, hazed freshmen, and generally misbehaved. Stone's decision to fire
                    popular head football coach Andy Smith in 1915, after taking control of the athletic program away
                    from the Purdue Athletic Association, reminded the university community that the officials and
                    students had different agendas. Purdue alumnus George Munro observed, 
                        The students see the president as an arbitrary and absolute executive who decides questions
                            of interest and importance to them without regard to the opinion of any man but
                            himself…. The president sees the boys as a lot of irresponsible boys, the ready
                            tools

                             of personal enemies who are seeking his downfall. They
                            do not appreciate his efforts made in their behalf and have poor judgment as to espouse such
                            a case as that of Smith.55
                  
                     Students and alumni alike worried that Stone's preoccupation with keeping football
                    in check might make them the laughingstock of the Big Ten Conference.56
            
            Although student organizations were recognized by Stone as respectable, they did not yet march in
                    step with the school's official culture. Glass may have hoped to mature and learn social
                    graces to help him succeed in life, but he still reveled in boisterous student life in 1915, noting
                    gleefully after the Boilermakers' first conference football victory that 
                        [The] boys got the old chapel bell and ran down town with it… we had a night Shirt
                            parade. I borrowed Keller's night shirt [and] we went down in West 
                                Lafayette
                             and marched all over 
                                Lafayette
                             ringing the bell and yelling… in columns of four … when
                            we got over the Main St. bridge we joined hands and gave the Serpentine dance ….
                            The boys stopped autos [and] pushed some of the backwards [non-Purdue youths] out of crowd
                            … Did not get up Sunday morning until 10 o'clock, went for a walk.57
                  
                     Its supporters defended the public rowdiness that remained a constant in college life
                    across the country as a necessary part of transforming boys into men. As the 1920s approached,
                    however, the way boys became men seemed to depend more on social relationships, consumerism, and the
                    development of personality.58
            
            While the transformation to modern manliness from a traditional manhood and, by association, the move
                    from a traditional school to a modern school reflected larger forces in American culture, it was
                    intensified at Purdue by student responses to a local tragedy, the train wreck of 1903.
            The wreck occurred on the morning of October 31 when the Big Four special, carrying players and fans
                    from West 
                        Lafayette
                     to 
                        Bloomington
                     for the annual Purdue-Indiana football game, rounded a long curve outside of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and rammed into a freight train backing off a spur line. In a moment the train lurched,
                    and the first car splintered between the engine and the cars behind it. Fourteen Purdue football
                    players, two staff members, and an alumnus guest were killed, and efforts to memorialize the
                    seventeen victims of the "worst tragedy in Purdue's history" led to the
                    construction of the Memorial Gymnasium and the early growth of the Purdue Memorial Union.59

            The train wreck had two serious repercussions. First, the students and Stone reconciled their
                    differences momentarily to find a satisfactory way to remember the dead. Their respective cultures
                    shaped the cooperative efforts to raise funds for what became the Memorial Gymnasium. Despite this
                    middle ground, the students found that the gymnasium largely ignored their values. The second effect
                    was that when the memorial failed the students, they capitalized on their developing sense of
                    modernity to provide for their cultural needs by forming the Purdue student union.
            Student reaction to the tragedy varied from base to idealistic. Some were inspired to improve their
                    lives. "All must be truer and better in consequence of the memory of those whose lives were
                    sacrificed," the Exponent reminded readers in its memorial issue. The
                    same publication later emphasized the manly qualities of the surviving players: 
                        The young man who would make a successful player must be of more than average mental and
                            physical strength … [so that he can have] control over himself…. After
                            the direful railroad wreck had occurred and when the injured were taken to hospitals
                            … they exhibited rare fortitude and patience … cheerfulness, as one
                            expects from the well, was given to everyone …60

                     Sim Miller, an end on the team and Purdue's
                    self-appointed poet laureate, boasted of his toughness when he recounted that upon waking moments
                    after the wreck, he pushed aside a foot in his face only to find it was his own. The newspaper that
                    printed this story noted that all of his friends had a good laugh over the incident. While the
                    youths recovered, they played cards, met with friends, strummed guitars and banjos, and sang, giving
                    the hospital ward a dorm-room atmosphere. Teammate G. B. Skrapp wrote to Miller, urging him to keep
                    his chin up because they were "all in this together."61 The
                    survivors saw themselves as maimed heroes who had survived a trial by fire that solidified their
                    bond. Not every player wanted to recoup quickly: D. H. Long wrote to Miller that the doctor had
                    cleared him to leave 
                        Louisville
                     and return to school, although he thought he might be able to stretch a few more days
                    out of his injury. This attitude prevailed back on campus as well. While Stone scheduled classes to
                    start after a few days of mourning, the students found themselves too bereaved to return to the
                    classroom for well over a week.62
            
            Stone's initial response had been to comfort the bereaved families. In the ensuing weeks and
                    months, he tried to balance the loss by

                    Only a day or so after the wreck, a 
                        Lafayette
                     area man suggested building a gymnasium as the best way to remember the day. The 
                        Lafayette
                    
                    Journal applauded the suggestion and immediately began taking donations and
                    channeling them to Purdue. Both Stone and the students saw the benefits of such an endeavor and
                    quickly assumed fundraising responsibilities. The administration formed a committee with Stone at
                    its head to solicit contributions and manage the funds that arrived from alumni groups around the
                    country. The president made fundraising speeches at alumni meetings, courted the general public, and
                    solicited corporate funds by characterizing the dead as martyrs in Purdue's mission to
                    produce well-rounded leaders.
            As the memorial efforts struggled over the next few years, students took it upon themselves to remind
                    the community of the wreck's human toll. The media blitz via the Debris
                    and Exponent kept alive the image of the dead and what the students thought they
                    represented. These efforts linked the dead players' honor with Memorial Gymnasium
                    fundraising: 
                        No [sic] vain was the struggle, for aye to the fore—
                        and ne'er in dishonor—our banner you bore;
                        And proudly we'll bear her, and carry her thro',
                        Inspired by your Knighthood, Brave Sons of Purdue!
                  
                        And here we will build you "Memorial Hall,"
                        Emblazon your glory on turret and wall,
                        And the future will sing of those Chieftains of Old
                  
                        Who gave up their lives for the Black and Old Gold.
                  
                    
            
            Despite student efforts, the memorial committee's fundraising goal of $100,000
                    was not met. Contributions came slowly after an early rush of popular subscriptions, public gifts,
                    and alumni and student donations. The committee discarded the idea of a union and built only a
                    gymnasium, collecting the last $15,000 of the $85,000 raised as a donation
                    from the Big Four Railroad.63
            
            The building suited Stone's needs rather than those of the students. He wanted an
                    institutional structure to reinforce his ideal of physical culture. Just as Fowler Hall provided a
                    space in which to pursue the arts, a gymnasium permitted students to work on their physiques. The
                    building might also remind them of the wreck's lessons on their roles in the university and
                    their goals for their education: 
                        I wish to say that you are undergoing a training calculated … to impress upon you

            At the dedication of the new building in 1908, Stone told his audience, most of whom had not been
                    enrolled at Purdue when the accident occurred, that the "great truth of the event centered
                    on the ability of the university as an institution to progress despite adversity and to offer
                    possibilities for future generations of Purdue students. The tragedy, he added, had reshaped and
                    continued to reshape Purdue: 
                        So out of grief and sorrow has come in the first place a precious memory of noble youths. A
                            memory which for generations to come should leave its impress upon student character at
                            Purdue, to make it more courageous and in the discharge of duty, more gentle and sympathetic
                            in its intercourse with others and more lofty in its aspirations and ideals. And in the
                            second place this beautiful building is a tangible and appropriate reminder of the high
                            ideals of physical culture and athletic prowess, which those young men exemplified
                            …. It is no stretch of fancy to think that into these shall be breathed something
                            of the spirit of the departed ones, and one may well believe that the true memorial which we
                            are today dedicating is to be not a sacred memory, not a structure of bricks or mortar but a
                            living vital spirit, perpetuated in the students of Purdue University.65

                            CULTURE.

            The students shared Stone's desire to augment the campus's physical facilities but
                    were more interested in a building that would provide a social setting. They wanted a place to work
                    out and improve their physiques, but they also wanted a student union to serve as a social center
                    with rooms for meetings, pool tables, and dances. Although they turned to off-campus haunts for fun,
                    they also needed a site on campus for their rapidly multiplying student organizations. A gymnasium
                    with a student union in it could provide male students not only a place to play sports and act
                    masculine, but also offices for class, club, and fraternity meetings, and, they hoped, a poolroom
                    where they could smoke and enjoy fraternal company. It soon became apparent that the gymnasium
                    failed their expectations. The small lounging room proved a popular place to rest, and the pool
                    attracted large numbers of visitors, but male students found that they could not use the gymnasium
                    as they wished. The space had to meet the demands of coeds, faculty, varsity teams, and the ROTC,
                    which used it as drilling grounds in the winter. As many students saw it, the gymnasium represented
                    Stone's ideas, rather than theirs.66
            
            These shortcomings led the classes of 1912 and 1913 to form the Purdue Union in 1912. Unlike the
                    Memorial Gymnasium, the movement for the Purdue Memorial Union derived solely from student

                     initiative. The union as an organization emerged because of the
                    need for an institution to facilitate the students' social development. The students knew
                    that the Memorial Gymnasium could not be an adequate social center, so they organized the student
                    body as a whole to raise money for a union building. That drive succeeded because its purpose was to
                    build an institution that reflected new ideas about gender roles and college life.67
            
            Fundraisers invoked a gift-giving tradition held over from the Memorial Gymnasium drive. In this way,
                    the students continued to commemorate the anniversary of the train wreck to goad students and alumni
                    into contributing to the union fund. The emphasis on the wreck shifted away from the dead and toward
                    its commemorative aspects.68 On the anniversary of the event, the Purdue Exponent recounted the accident, detailed how the gym came into being, and
                    described what it represented. Students were heavily featured in these accounts; the paper noted
                    that while they had a gym, they still had no place to enjoy social fellowship. As the contributions
                    slowed to a trickle, the newly founded Purdue Alumnus magazine took the lead in
                    reinvigorating the drive. Though it spoke to all graduates, the appeal was mainly to recent
                    graduates. Indeed, students who had matriculated since 1908 dominated the magazine and the
                    fundraising effort. Fundraising picked up temporarily before falling again. Then the union stumbled
                    onto a bit of luck.69
            
            The patriotism generated by the United States' participation in the First World War provided
                    a much-needed boost to the project. The Purdue Alumnus used the swelling
                    nationalism associated with the war to convince its readers that the union should be both a memorial
                    and a nursery of patriotism. In teaching students how to act as modern men, the union would reflect
                    efforts to combat postwar Red Scare evils—immoral behavior, socialism, and (at least
                    implicitly) the threats presented by Jews, Catholics, and African Americans— by becoming
                    a place to develop Americanism. In its memorial capacity, it would serve as a space where returning
                    alumni could meet and remember everything good about the men who died while carrying out the Purdue
                    mission. Contributors responded to this propaganda both on campus and off. Huge amounts of money
                    came in from the wealthy alumni who prospered in the booming postwar economy. They eventually
                    pledged one million dollars, although getting them to pay up became harder as the years passed. The
                        Exponent and the Alumnus continued to mark the anniversary
                    of the wreck in order to

                     remind potential contributors of student needs. In 1922 and
                    1923, with the building nearing completion and the funds not yet all collected, the union committee
                    invoked the war dead once again, and publicized the fear that the union might never be completed if
                    pledges were not paid. They charged delinquent contributors with failing to honor fallen heroes and
                    demonstrating that Purdue's graduates possessed neither the patriotism nor the wealth to
                    contribute to the union. These threats proved strong enough to finish the collection, and the union
                    opened in 1924. The fact that less than a quarter of the money raised was donated between 1912 and
                    1914 suggests that the memory of the World War I dead was more effective in raising money than the
                    memory of the train wreck victims.70
            
            The completion of the Purdue Memorial Union marked the beginning of the large-scale expansion of
                    Purdue's campus. After Stone died at age fifty-nine in a mountain-climbing accident in the
                    Canadian Rockies during the summer of 1921, Edward C. Elliott was named Purdue president. Elliott
                    was willing to employ alumni and corporations in Purdue expansions, which filled the university
                    coffers and foreshadowed the post-World War II growth that created the Purdue of today.71
            
            The Union gave the students a place to hone their social skills, serving the same purpose in the
                    social sphere that the classroom served in the academic and the gymnasium in the physical spheres of
                    Purdue undergraduate life. To general manager J. C. Walters, the Union fostered "an
                    education on the side of humanity."72 The building provided a place
                    where men and women joined in mixed groups and still maintained gendered roles. Dining halls and a
                    ballroom gave them a space in which to interact. At the same time, the Union facilitated the
                    segregation of the sexes, by way of men's and women's lounges. Men could also
                    retreat to the male sanctuaries of the barbershop and pool hall. Thus, student culture accepted
                    women and, at the same time, provided men an escape into the comfortable confines of fraternity. In
                    sum, the Union updated traditional student culture to fit the emerging 1920s' culture of
                        youth.73

            What happened at Purdue during these years is representative of the changes that were underway across
                    all of American higher education. The college world grew more bureaucratic, women made their way
                    into public spaces, and the more ostentatious displays of coltish energy, such as rushes, scraps,
                    burnings, and mock funerals, first became more organized and then were discarded as immature. While
                    reflecting its particular history, Purdue joined the general trend of universities grafting
                    traditional values onto a modern, corporate structure.74
            
            It was the interaction between the students and Winthrop Stone that drove this process. In the early
                    years of his administration, Stone had waged a war against an undisciplined student culture in an
                    attempt to make Purdue a nationally renowned school. His charges agreed that they attended college
                    to train for a career and that they wanted an education that provided the opportunity to prosper as
                    adults. Yet the world students created, which valued local identities, anti-establishmentarianism,
                    and violence, often ran contrary to this goal. "College life" provided their last
                    chance to enjoy youthful self-indulgence before assuming adult roles as parents and providers. This
                    changed during the second half of Stone's tenure, as the process of memorializing, first
                    those who died in the train wreck and then the World War I heroes, brought the students'
                    own increasing tendencies to organize college life in line with Stone's efforts to
                    reconfigure Purdue into a modern university. As student culture became more structured, students
                    tried to regulate the traditions and rituals of college life, but eventually did away with them when
                    they "outlived [their] usefulness."75
            
            The original design for the Memorial Gymnasium appealed to male students because it promised a venue
                    in which they could enhance their masculinity through exercise and athletic competition, as well as
                    poolrooms where they could relax. The social needs of all students were to be addressed by offering
                    meeting rooms for the growing list of clubs and other organizations. When, in the name of economy,
                    Stone cut these latter features from the plans, reducing the gymnasium to a strictly athletic
                    facility, student interest waned. Since the university had neglected their social needs, students
                    decided to take responsibility for them by launching a fundraising drive to build the Purdue Union,
                    a facility they truly could call their own. After it

                     opened, the Union maintained a safe distance from the
                    administration, operating without university funds and offering leisure pursuits that Stone had not
                    approved beforehand.76
            
            The students' vision for the Union was more farsighted than Stone's for the
                    Memorial Gymnasium. By the mid-1930s, the gym was obsolete and was replaced by Lambert Fieldhouse.
                    For awhile it was used for women's athletics and intramural sports before being transformed
                    into the home of the computer sciences department in 1985. The Purdue Memorial Union still exists as
                    the showpiece of student culture on the Purdue campus. It continually reshapes itself, most recently
                    through renovating the hotel annex and by keeping the services it provides the student community
                    up-to-date with contemporary culture.77
            
            Boisterous behavior, especially in the wake of major athletic victories and defeats, has not
                    disappeared from Purdue. One Boilermaker's statement that he was not angry
                    "because we lost" the women's NCAA national basketball championship but
                    was "just happy to riot," indicates that a streak of rebellion for its own sake is
                    found in today's students as it was in those at the turn of the twentieth century.78 In a letter to the editors of the Exponent, the writer
                    explained that "students participated in the riot because … [i]t's a
                    bit dangerous; it destroys property; but the fact remains that it's fun" and that
                    it "made one feel like a rebel, above the law, powerful, and
                    social" [emphasis added].79 Even as official and student cultures
                    continue to accommodate one another, it seems safe to say that at least some laws of college custom
                    have proven as inexorable as those dictated by chemistry or physics.

            It is not surprising that the post-World War II Red Scare—the fear of Communist subversion
                    of American institutions prompted by the advent of the Cold War—fell upon American higher
                    education in an especially vicious fashion. As postwar hopes for a secure international peace faded,
                    Americans began to fear the possibility of a new war with the Soviet Union and to worry about
                    threats of Communist influence at home. The Republican party, desperate to win back the White House
                    after over a decade of Democratic electoral successes, began to manipulate this fear as a political
                    strategy; Democrats responded similarly.1 Among the chief targets of this
                    strategy were the nation's universities. As David Caute pointed out in his study of the
                    anti-Communist drives of the early 1950s, "the American teaching profession has almost
                    invariably stood exposed as a target for suspicion and aggression at times of super patriotic
                    sensitivity." What Caute came to label as the mass "political purges" of
                    teachers and professors began in 1948 and continued through the McCarthy era of the early and middle
                    1950s. The process would eventually cost more than six hundred teachers and professors their jobs as
                    well as ruin the professional reputations of many more. Hardest hit were schools on the east coast,
                    such as 
                        Harvard
                    , MIT, and the 
                        New York
                     City college system, along with several west coast schools, such as the University of
                    Washington and the entire university system of 
                        California
                    .2 Interestingly, however, one of the very first casualties from
                    higher education in the Cold War taught at small 
                        Evansville
                     College, located in the quiet midwestern community of 
                        Evansville
                    , Indiana.
            Virtually forgotten today, Professor George Parker's firing stunned the academic world of
                    the time, raising again the question of the right of college and university professors to academic
                    freedom and free speech. Caute called the Parker dismissal "one of the most interesting
                    cases" of all the firing episodes, but he gave only the

               3 Since the case is among the earliest examples of a
                    university's firing a faculty member during the Cold War, a reexamination of the story may
                    serve to convey a deeper understanding of the forces that ravaged higher education in the period. To
                    understand the Parker case better, however, two important elements must first be examined. One
                    involves the nature of 
                        Evansville
                     and the college's place in it, and the other concerns the political climate of
                    the day.
            In the late 1940s, the nation continued to experience the sweeping demographic and cultural
                    transformations brought on by World War II. The war had mobilized millions of Americans who
                    otherwise would never have experienced the world beyond their home towns. Twenty million Americans
                    left home to work in the war industry, becoming part of "the largest internal immigration
                    in American history." Culturally, the great changes wrought by World War II are reflected
                    in the release of two books in the early postwar years, Dr. Benjamin Spock's The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care, which urged a more permissive approach to
                    childrearing than before, and Alfred C. Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the Human
                        Male, which reported that many practices believed to be sinful were in fact common. The
                    latter in particular suggested a waning "of moral certainty." These changes drove
                    moral leaders of the conservative southwestern Indiana community of 
                        Evansville
                     to battle perceived attacks on traditional morality. But despite the disturbing changes
                    unfolding all around them, residents of the city could hope that the area's geographic
                    seclusion might allow them to escape the full effects of these great shifts. Indeed, its remoteness
                    led journalist John Bartlow Martin in the late 1940s to surmise that "more than once its
                    isolation has made 
                        Evansville
                     an eddy on the stream of events."4
            
            Ironically, the events that led to Parker's dismissal reflected 
                        Evansville
                    's isolation. Located in the nation's heartland, safe from foreign
                    attack, and with a large labor force, 
                        Evansville
                     had been the site chosen for a number of industrial plants during World War II. At the
                    height of wartime production, sixty thousand people worked in the city. After the war ended, many
                    plants turned to making refrigerators and other appliances for the postwar boom. International
                    Harvester moved to town in 1946, and began producing refrigerators in the former Republic Aviation
                    plant. Thus 
                        Evansville
                     was dubbed the "Refrigerator Capital of the World."5

            The intellectual heart of the 
                        Evansville
                     community was 
                        Evansville
                     College. Founded in 1854 at Moore's Hill, Indiana, the college had moved to 
                        Evansville
                     in 1919 as a joint venture of the Methodist Church and the 
                        Evansville
                     Chamber of Commerce. The private school's board of trustees was made up
                    primarily of conservative local business leaders.6 Like most small private
                    institutions of higher education, 
                        Evansville
                     College struggled through the Great Depression and World War II, both of which reduced
                    enrollment. The end of the war, however, brought salvation in the form of the GI Bill, passed by
                    Congress in 1944 to aid veterans. By 1946 the student enrollment had exploded to more than 1,500
                    students, an increase of more than one thousand from the year before.7
                    Unfortunately, the school had only one building. 
                        Evansville
                     College's president, Lincoln B. Hale, soon developed a plan to alleviate this
                    problem. A graduate of Yale University, Hale had arrived at the college during the 1930s. Serving
                    two years as

                            74-111.

                                Evansville
                             College, Linc (1947).
               
                     dean and registrar, he moved up to the position of acting
                    president in 1940 and became president in 1941. Hale immersed himself in the conservative 
                        Evansville
                     community, joining civic organizations and hobnobbing with business leaders who
                    contributed most of the support for capital improvements and maintenance of the school.8
            
            In the late 1940s, Hale and college leaders began to redefine the school's mission to
                    include preparing students for jobs in the local manufacturing plants. Business leaders responded by
                    funding construction of an engineering building in 1948. The school's yearbook, the Linc, lauded this expansion of the college's educational mission:
                    "To improve its service in both a cultural and vocational way in a balanced program,
                    without emphasizing one at the expense of the other, the College has adopted 'the Urban
                    pattern,' which carries out the aim of teaching both how to live and how to earn a
                        living."9 The next year the Linc labeled the
                    cooperation between the school and local manufacturers "the 
                        Evansville
                     Plan" and observed that local industry called for "an emphasis on
                    training that satisfies specific needs, both cultural and vocational, in this area, rather than
                    pursuing solely the objectives of a college education in general."10
            
            The college's catalogue for 1947 also called attention to the school's close links
                    to local business concerns; it stated emphatically that the institution had "adapted its
                    offerings to the needs and desires of the community" and established a "closer
                    liaison between the college and … business and industry."11
                    But "the 
                        Evansville
                     Plan" so touted by Hale came at a price. Local manufacturing leaders had
                    provided large gifts for the new engineering building, and the school's board of trustees
                    soon was dominated by local businessmen. A few of them who held especially conservative political
                    views became increasingly vocal regarding politics after the Cold War intensified in early 1948.12
            
            To help handle the sharp increase in the number of new students, most of them veterans, on the 
                        Evansville
                     College campus in the late 1940s, a boyish-looking twenty-six-year-old from the East
                    was hired to teach in the philosophy and religion department of the school. George F. Parker
                    (1918-1998), a 1940 graduate of 
                        Boston
                     College who earned a master of arts degree from Yale University in 1943, came to the 
                        Ohio
                     River city with his wife in the fall of 1946. The fact that they had the same alma
                    mater influenced Hale's hiring Parker. The young scholar was a good catch for the college,
                    a point underscored by the fact that Hale invited the young man and his wife to live with him until
                    the couple secured adequate housing. It was during this

                     time that Hale explained to Parker, a liberal, that the 
                        Evansville
                     community was conservative and that the college needed community support.13
            
            Living in a such a conservative area of the country may have been uncomfortable for Parker and his
                    wife. He was working on his doctorate at Yale and planned to go elsewhere, perhaps back East, after
                    he had completed his academic work. Meanwhile he borrowed money from 
                        Evansville
                     College through a program that the school offered to faculty members and arranged for a
                    week's leave every semester to travel to 
                        New Haven
                    . In return, he performed well. Parker was judged "to be alert, intelligent,
                    and of high purpose." His liberal and idealistic outlook was well-received across the
                    campus. The likable young professor soon gained a reputation as "a stimulating
                    teacher," and Hale also reported that Parker was "one of the few teachers of
                    religion at 
                        Evansville
                     College of whom there were no complaints." Parker was reappointed for
                    1947-1948 and 1948-1949. While not a partisan of any particular political viewpoint, he expressed
                    "a zeal for the improvement of mankind" and was considered a proponent of liberal
                        positions.14 But Hale's remark that there were no complaints about
                    Parker's teaching in religion classes would soon be proven false.
            A great number of the faculty and students, the majority of the latter now made up of veterans, held
                    strong conservative convictions. One of the more colorful student leaders of the campus, Kilburn
                    Durham, was an army veteran. Durham wrote a popular column for the school paper, titled
                    "Field Marshal." The title was acquired after Durham and some friends purchased a
                    1928 Buick touring car with no top, painted it in a camouflage pattern and, with Durham wearing a
                    German army spiked helmet and an army great coat, drove the vehicle around the campus. Durham
                    strolling across the school's wide front lawn wearing his ragged great coat was a common
                    sight on campus.15
            
            In a piece written less than a month before the Parker controversy, the ultraconservative
                    "field marshal" sadly pondered student veterans' abandonment of the habit
                    of wearing portions of their old uniforms. "Even the discharge pins have
                    disappeared," Durham mourned. Durham then waded into a more political area. "The
                    veterans with whom I talked seemed pretty unanimous about one thing or two … that war is
                    terrible—a horror. That the only justification for war is the defense of liberty. And no
                    matter the traitorous sneers and carpings of the 'liberals,' [the veterans] feel
                    they have liberty in America." Durham went on to assert that 
                        Evansville
                     College veterans concurred

                     "that war is almost inevitable between ourselves and
                    the Soviets. That the only thing worse than fighting a war is losing one. That they are tired,
                    terribly tired of war—but that they will fight again…. And that the sooner we
                    begin, the better chance we will have."16
            
            Another sign of increasing campus conservatism could be found in the many strong outcries in early
                    1948 among students regarding the perceived growing dangers of Communist influence on American
                    college campuses. One troubled 
                        Evansville
                     student, however, wrote to the editors of the school's newspaper, the Crescent, voicing his concern over the sudden political hypersensitivity.
                    "There are two dangers inherent to a student body from such present hysteria—the
                    first and greatest lies in the overwhelming readiness of students to condemn as
                    'Communistic' any statement or practice which does not agree with their own
                    thoughts; without regard to truth or facts, the average student will unfailingly dismiss such
                    thoughts by applying the current most devastating
                        censure—'Communistic.'"17
            
            Despite the growing influence of conservatives on the campus, there were factors in the situation
                    that may have encouraged Parker to feel secure in his position. In early 1948 Hale distributed an
                    address to the 
                        Evansville
                     College faculty written by Herman B Wells, Indiana University's chief
                    executive, in which Wells declared that university teachers had "a duty to participate in
                    civic and political affairs." Furthermore, the college, as an accredited institution of
                    higher learning, subscribed to the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) 1940
                    "Statement on Principles of Academic Freedom and Tenure," which maintained that
                    "an officer of an educational institution… should be free from institutional
                    censorship or discipline."18
            
            The 1948 presidential election was one of the most extraordinary in American political history. At
                    the center of the story stands Harry Truman's stunning come-from-behind victory over Thomas
                    E. Dewey. Less remembered is the ill-fated campaign of third-party candidate Henry A. Wallace, who
                    ran on the Progressive party ticket. Wallace, who had served as Franklin D. Roosevelt's
                    secretary of agriculture and later as vice president, also served in the Truman cabinet as secretary
                    of commerce, until the president fired him in 1946.19 At the heart of
                    Wallace's break with the Democratic party in 1948 lay a profound disagreement between
                    Wallace and Truman regarding their views of the Soviet Union. Wallace, who hoped to develop stronger
                    economic ties with the Soviets and in so doing help American farmers, perceived the Soviets as
                    potential allies and trading partners. Wallace's

                                New York

                     views on world peace, civil rights, workers' rights,
                    and women's rights greatly excited idealists, young and old alike, including George Parker.
                    When Wallace announced his candidacy in late December 1947, his popularity initially secured him the
                    approval of almost 15 percent of respondents in the polls.20
            
            Truman, locked in a tight race with the Republican Dewey, knew he probably would lose the southern
                    Democratic vote to the segregationist Dixiecrat candidate, Strom Thurmond. Wallace threatened to
                    draw votes from the labor-liberal wing of the Democratic party, a loss that would diminish
                    Truman's chances for victory severely. Truman's only hope was to strike hard at
                    Wallace and pull as many supporters away from him as possible. Playing to the growing fear of
                    Communism, Truman's strategists stooped to painting Wallace and his followers as
                    Communists. Truman had already begun a campaign to purge unions of Communists and suspected
                    Communists, which he accomplished with the help of Congress of Industrial Organization (CIO) leaders
                    who needed a Democrat president "more than he need[ed] them."21 When Wallace stumped for votes across the nation in the spring and summer of 1948,
                    pro-Truman labor, along with veterans' groups, led the attack on Wallace as a Communist.
                    Before a Wallace appearance, Truman supporters would stir fears about local subversive activities.
            The press took up the attack on Wallace as well. The day after he announced his run, the 
                        New York
                    
                    Sun observed, "Henry A. Wallace and his communist left-wing following are
                    speeding today their plans for the national convention of the progressive citizens of
                        America."22 A week later, in a syndicated column, Ralph McGill
                    wrote that Wallace was "not a Communist but he has allowed himself to be badgered into
                    becoming the Soviet Union's mouthpiece and best friend in this country."23 In an editorial written just a month before Wallace came to nearby 
                        Evansville
                    , the normally liberal 
                        St. Louis
                    
                    Post-Dispatch declared, "Mr. Wallace habitually talks in words that echo
                    the communist party line."24
            
            Returning to his office in mid-February after a vacation, Hale found in a prominent place on his desk
                    a newspaper clipping that reported Parker's acceptance the previous month of the temporary
                    chairmanship of the 
                        Vanderburgh County
                     Citizens for Wallace organization. Hale later told the AAUP investigating committee,
                    "I knew at once that certain trouble for 
                        Evansville
                     College might well be involved."25

            In Parker's account of these events to the AAUP, he said he had planned to tell Hale
                    personally about the appointment, which he had accepted reluctantly. He also wanted Hale to know
                    that the position was temporary, as he hoped to be back at Yale that summer working on his Ph.D. But
                    Parker knew the president would be especially busy following the break, so he postponed the meeting.
                    Three days after Hale's return, he called Parker into his office. In Hale's
                    account to the AAUP, the college president noted, "Within a week I called Mr. Parker in for
                    a conference. I made it quite clear to him that further participation in such an official political
                    capacity would prove embarrassing to me and would be certain to seriously harm 
                        Evansville
                     College." Hale asked Parker 
                        if it were not possible for him to withdraw and not become the permanent
                            chairman. I made it quite clear that he had a right to vote, think, and talk as he
                            desired—in fact could meet with the group if so desired—but urgently
                            asked that he refrain from official activity for the sake of the College he had chosen to
                            serve.
                     Hale recalled Parker asking four times 
                        if I had any specific proposal and each time I repeated that he must make the decision
                            himself, clearly indicating what I knew was best for the college we both served. At the
                            conclusion of the interview I further pointed out the danger that he, a liberal, by
                            overstepping, might be responsible for forcing 
                                Evansville
                             College into a much more conservative position. He left saying he would see
                            what he could do. He did not choose to discuss the matter further, or to inform me of his
                                decision.26
                  
                    
            
            Parker's account of the interview did not differ materially from Hale's, except to
                    mention Hale's emphasis on the conservatism of the community. But Parker felt that
                    Hale's words constituted a "veiled threat." He reported that at the
                    conclusion of the interview, 
                        I left the office with the statement that I did not want to embarrass the college, that I was
                            very concerned about the present world situation, as I knew he was, and that though we
                            differed as to analysis and solution of the problem, I could not conscientiously cease my
                            political activity …. The arrival of a successor as Chairman of the Wallace
                            organization was something which I desired, but which was out of my control. [Hale] replied
                            that, of course, situations might arise which were out of his control.27
                  
                    
            
            Shortly after the meeting, several persons from the college urged Parker to resign his political
                    post. Hale "appealed to one of Parker's closest friends to counsel with
                    him," while concerned faculty members and several student leaders "tried to point
                    out the inevitable results" of his political activity.28 Just after the
                    conversation between Hale and Parker and less than a month before Wallace came to 
                        Evansville
                    , Truman addressed a joint session of Congress. For the first time, the president
                    accused the Soviet Union of causing the Cold War. The Russians, Truman asserted, had used all sorts
                    of brutal means to destroy democracy and independence in central and eastern Europe.

                     Indeed, the Soviet leadership sought to dominate the entire
                    continent. Later that night Truman turned up the emotional rhetoric to a fever pitch, declaring that
                    he did not want the support of "Henry Wallace and his Communists." He further
                    warned that the Communists sought to deny "the very existence of God," an
                    accusation sure to stir up conservative communities such as 
                        Evansville
                    .29
            
            Hale was already starting to feel the heat from conservative supporters of the college whose feelings
                    about Wallace bordered on hatred. Luckily for Parker and his worried colleagues, the local press
                    carried little or no mention of the local Wallace organization through February and March. Hale now
                    assumed that Parker had caved in to the advice and pressure and, relying on this assumption, decided
                    to renew the popular young teacher's contract for the 1948-1949 school year. Parker
                    received his new contract on March 18 and four days later was granted a leave of absence for the
                    summer to go to Yale. Although administrators had heard reports that Parker distributed pro-Wallace
                    literature to students in his classroom, they made no mention of the allegations at
                    Parker's contract meeting.30 Both men now believed erroneously that
                    they understood the other's intentions. So things stood on April 6, 1948, when Wallace
                    arrived to make an important political speech at the 
                        Evansville
                     Coliseum.
            Wallace, a tall, angular man with a shock of graying hair, had an open and engaging face. Some
                    Wallace acquaintances, however, found him "an ethereal sort, difficult to know and hard to
                    talk to." A few thought him a bit wacky. Rumor had circulated in 1940, for example, that
                    Wallace had been in contact with a Russian clairvoyant31 Wallace intended to
                    make a swords-into-plowshares speech in 
                        Evansville
                    . The city had been a key location for aircraft manufacturing during World War II, and
                    Wallace looked to it as the place where he would propose "producing planes for peaceful
                    purposes under government ownership."32
            
            Three days before Wallace spoke at 
                        Evansville
                     a large veterans' organization issued a statement, carried in the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Press, questioning Wallace's motives in running for president:
                    "Maybe Wallace can tell us in his speech here why he aspires to be President of these
                    United States, at the same time accepting the support of groups dedicated to the overthrow of the
                    very things he seeks," presumably referring to the Communist party's endorsement
                    of Wallace in January 1948. The veterans were perturbed that Wallace's speech was to be
                    made on Army Day and "in a Soldiers Memorial Coliseum." The polemic even raised
                    doubts about Wallace's loyalty:

                        In these critical times it is the duty of every solid American citizen to give serious
                            thought to any individual or political party whose criticism of our government's
                            foreign policy coincides with the attacks directed upon us as a nation by a foreign power.
                            … The various groups that have publicly declared themselves in favor of Mr.
                            Wallace's candidacy for the presidency of these United States gives cause for great
                            concern upon our part as to just whose interest Mr. Wallace has at heart…. We do
                            not want the heart of our great country to become rotten and disintegrated, making it an
                            easy conquest for an evil force which respects not people's rights, desires or
                                ambitions.33
                  
                    
            
            The article in which the statement appeared listed Parker as the chairman of the 
                        Vanderburgh County
                     Citizens for Wallace Committee. The next day the same paper carried a strong
                    anti-Wallace editorial entitled, "The Big Lie." On the editorial page, the paper
                    ran a political cartoon of a buck-toothed Wallace beating the swords of the American security
                    program into Soviet sickles.34 A Truman pronouncement labeling Wallace
                    subversive, made at about the same time, also raised the ire and the fear of many Americans. Wallace
                    himself would later blame the Truman statement for being the main cause of what took place in 
                        Evansville
                    .35
            
            Local labor troubles further added to the mounting tension. The city had witnessed a number of bitter
                    strikes before Wallace's visit. One union in particular, the United Electrical Workers,
                    Local 813, whose members were especially fervent Wallace supporters, had a substantial number of
                    Communist party members in its ranks. In the early spring of 1948, an 
                        Evansville
                     paper carried an expose of Communist activity in Local 813. In September, a
                    congressional hearing would take place in 
                        Evansville
                    , investigating Communist influence in the local. One of the union's Communist
                    members, John Payne, appeared with Henry Wallace and George Parker the evening of April 6. Thus
                    Parker would find himself deemed guilty by association in the eyes of powerful 
                        Evansville
                     business leaders.36
            
            By the day of Wallace's arrival in 
                        Evansville
                    , the mood of the city was tense. Many area veterans had joined with anti-Wallace
                    labor-union members to protest the speech. The 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Courier reported that "a parade to protest the appearance here of Henry
                    A. Wallace, candidate for president, will be held at 7 o'clock tonight. … The
                    parade will be sponsored by The Spirit of Kilroy,' an organization of veterans employed in
                    local industrial plants." The leader of this group, Arthur Robinson, explained the
                    "purpose of the parade is not only to protest against the appearance of Mr. Wallace in the
                    city but also 'against the use of the Coliseum, a monument to service men, for the

                    "that all veterans and their families are invited to participate in the parade, but
                    'not any persons who believe in communist principles.'"37 Local pro-Wallace labor leaders now desired to cancel their candidate's speech,
                    fearing that it would prompt violence. But Wallace campaign managers argued that giving in to the
                    threat of violence in 
                        Evansville
                     would adversely affect future Wallace engagements.38 For the
                    Wallace group, there was no turning back.
            With pressure building, Hale fretted over what to do about Parker. In the later AAUP report on the
                    Parker firing, Hale stated that "within the three or four days prior to the meeting, after
                    it had become known that Professor Parker would preside, an increasing flow of protests came from
                    many sources which indicated clearly that Mr. Parker's actions were bringing a vote of no
                    confidence in the College."39
            
            On the morning of the speech, Wallace woke early and took a stroll through the residential section of
                    downtown 
                        Evansville
                    . Later he met with striking workers at the city's Seeger refrigerator plant,
                    where he was accompanied by local officials of the CIO Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers Union.
                    When told by reporters that his speech would be picketed by "a veterans' group
                    stemming from the Briggs plant organized to fight Communism," Wallace remarked, "I
                    hope when they finish they'll come over to my meeting and listen. I think they'll
                    find it interesting."40 The 
                        Evansville
                     College newspaper, the Crescent, reported, "Mr. Wallace, a
                    well-dressed hulk of a man who seemed to be tiring under the strain of vigorous campaigning, met the
                    questions of nearly two dozen reporters at his press conference, answering some, sidestepping
                        others.'"41 In a photograph that appeared in that
                    evening's paper, a boyish-looking Parker sat at the right hand of a handsome but somber
                        Wallace.42
            
            The coliseum, built in 1916, had once hosted a variety of sophisticated events, but during and after
                    World War II, according to one historian, "Philharmonic concerts drew sparse crowds [while]
                    hillbilly music and wrestling matches packed [it]."43 Roughly two hours
                    before Wallace began his speech, a small group, estimated at fewer than one hundred people, began to
                    gather at Main Street and Riverside Drive for a parade to the coliseum. Led by Robinson of the
                    "Spirit of Kilroy" organization and following an American flag, the parade
                    proceeded up Main Street as the marchers chanted, "I don't want him, you can have
                    him, he's too red for me." Many veterans, wearing

                    Hitler, Russia has Stalin, we don't want Wallace for the USA," and
                    "Stalin, Tito, Wallace." Upon reaching the courthouse, a block from the coliseum,
                    the group stopped, and Robinson spoke from the courthouse steps to a group of more than two
                    thousand, which "filled the sidewalks and stood on the lawns and in the
                        streets."44
            
            Pointing out that both major parties had disavowed Wallace, Robinson declared, "We have met
                    here to demonstrate our resentment because of the presence of Henry Wallace in our city on Army Day.
                    All decent American citizens do resent his presence here and the unsavory reputation of those who
                    support him." Robinson then asserted, 
                        Your choice of a presidential candidate can, and probably will, mean the difference between
                            your freedom and your enslavement. We, who are veterans, did not let you down in time of
                            war. Do not let us down in peace time. At least give us a chance to die honorably. Elect a
                            president fit to be commander-in-chief of our armed forces, not one who will turn our
                            government over to another nation. That group in Memorial Coliseum tonight and their
                            candidate, Henry Wallace, are enemies to the American way of life. Go to your homes
                            peacefully and keep those thoughts in mind.45
                  
                     Robinson's admonition to the protestors to go to their homes peacefully was
                    probably not made in good faith.
            In fact, many of the protestors went to the coliseum, where they found a girls' accordion
                    band, led by Mrs. Jean Campbell, which came marching in as a part of a reunion of World War I
                    veterans. The protestors, apparently believing that the red-clad girls were part of the Wallace
                    meeting, heckled them with shouts of "Red" and "Communist,"
                    causing the confused band members quickly to flee the scene. Meanwhile, those who had come to listen
                    to Wallace got their first taste of what the night held in store when, upon entering the coliseum
                    auditorium, they were booed and called "Pinkie," or
                        "communist."46 Inside the coliseum a crowd of about five
                    hundred people listened as Parker opened the meeting with an invocation. In the prayer, Parker
                    emphasized a popular focus of the Wallace campaign, that of world peace.47
            
            The prayer was followed by the singing of "The Star Spangled Banner," led by
                    Parker's wife, Ivol. Parker then gave a short talk in which he repeated many of the Wallace
                    themes. One line was especially prophetic. "Our country's heritage means nothing
                    if it doesn't mean our freedom to express our political views without danger of losing our
                    jobs." Parker also acknowledged the growing disturbance just outside:

                        More dangerous than the atom bomb are those well-meaning folks across the street, who
                            won't come out to hear someone they think they don't like, and who
                            haven't taken the trouble to find out what he stands for. You will hear Mr. Wallace
                            speak tonight for 30-40 minutes. Don't think you know all that he stands for. If
                            you really want to know, you must read his books, columns, and hear his speeches. The press
                            will of course not print most of what he says. There are powerful interests that want to
                            make it very difficult for you to know.
                     Parker concluded his introduction by urging the audience "to continue to demand
                    unbiased information and to associate with local groups whose programs they could
                        endorse."48
            
            At this point it was clear that a serious disturbance was taking shape. Demonstrators "on
                    both sides of the building" were "breaking windows and hammering on
                    doors," according to Parker. After he finished his speech, Parker hurried to the main door,
                    where he met several 
                        Evansville
                     College students who told him they wished to hear what Wallace had to say but had not
                    been allowed into the auditorium. When Parker motioned to the assistant chief of police and informed
                    him of the students' problem, the officer rudely rebuffed Parker and told him to go back
                    inside. A later official investigation of the disorder stated, "It is probable that had the
                    police been more alert they could have prevented much of the disturbance."49
            
            Replacing Parker on stage, Payne, leader of the local electricians' union, condemned the
                    demonstration outside the doors as "vicious hysteria" and
                    "intimidation" to "hogtie the working man until he's afraid to
                    raise his voice." After Payne spoke, Kenneth 
                        Spencer
                    , a "Negro baritone," stepped up to the platform and began singing
                    "Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho." It was then that a large number of
                    anti-Wallace protestors surged into the foyer of the coliseum and came crashing through the front
                    doors. The hoots and yells of the demonstrators, along with their constant banging on the doors,
                    drowned out 
                        Spencer
                    's singing. Many in the audience felt threatened, and several attempted to
                    leave but could not do so without braving the screaming group in the foyer. At first Wallace
                    supporters began to barricade "the doors with metal chairs after the crowd had tried to
                    break into the auditorium." Then, members of Local 813, who had volunteered to keep order
                    at the rally, rushed outside the auditorium only to realize they could not stop the disorderly
                    crowd. They quickly retreated. It was at this juncture that several members of Wallace's
                    support staff went out to confront the troublemakers.50
            
            According to the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Press, "Cliff Welch, Wallace advance man, went into the turbulent lobby
                    and came back into the auditorium with a black eye. C. B. Baldwin, Wallace campaign manager and
                    former farm security administrator, also went into the foyer and was

                     pushed around, although uninjured. John Schultz, a CIO factory
                    worker acting as usher, was reported to have been struck." The reporter continued,
                    "Whenever anyone looked out of the doors of the auditorium into the foyer there were cries
                    of 'Communist' and 'Red.' There were four plain-clothes
                    detectives inside the building. Police Chief Bonham and a few uniformed police were outside the
                    building when the group broke in. More police arrived, and the foyer was cleared in about a half
                        hour."51
            
            As police began to move the demonstrators out of the building, William Gailmor spoke from the podium.
                    A former national radio announcer, Gailmor was Wallace's primary fundraiser. Some of the
                    anti-Wallace crowd had entered the balcony and booed and heckled Gailmor until Local 813 ushers
                    quieted them down. Once the hollering had stopped, Gailmor declared, "What's
                    happening here tonight is not an American manifestation. It's a sick off-shoot of what we
                    want to cure. Behind this hysteria is a panic that is not ours."52
            
            After most of the protestors had been cleared from the room and it was deemed safe, Wallace was
                    brought from the McCurdy Hotel by police escort, entered the coliseum through a side door, and
                    delivered a speech in which he proposed government ownership of America's military aircraft
                    industry. "The time has come to take the profits out of war and the threat of
                    war," Wallace proclaimed. Although many demonstrators had left, outside there were still
                    "occasional choruses of jeers and explosions of fire crackers."53
            
            Parker quickly dismissed the audience after Wallace had finished his speech. As the candidate left
                    the coliseum to prepare for his 
                        Indianapolis
                     stop, a shaken but facetious Wallace told reporters, "Seldom have I received
                    such a warm and enthusiastic reception as I have in 
                        Evansville
                    ."54 Because of protestors lingering outside the Coliseum,
                    it took an hour to turn Wallace's car around so that he could get back to the McCurdy
                        Hotel.55 For Parker, the meeting may have revealed the depth of fear and
                    hatred against Wallace, even in a small community such as 
                        Evansville
                    . Nevertheless, Parker apparently felt his college appointment was safe. On the day
                    following the Wallace debacle, Ivol Parker reportedly told a faculty member, "George is not
                    worried. He has his contract for next year."56
            
            Wallace's hostile reception by the mob at 
                        Evansville
                     was reported widely. Leading national news publications, including Time,
                        Newsweek, the

                party, the Daily Worker, blamed a "fascist mob, led by union
                    splitters" for the 
                        Evansville
                     attacks on Wallace supporters.57
            
            The evening after Wallace's speech, Hale called an emergency meeting of his academic dean
                    and two other faculty members. The group discussed "a resume of the numerous telephone
                    calls made to representatives of the College and to the local Chamber of Commerce … the
                    personal statements made by individuals and friends of the College; and … group actions
                    being taken for the purpose of bringing pressure on 
                        Evansville
                     College to dismiss Mr. Parker." Responding to demands from local citizens,
                    many of them business leaders who supported the college financially, the four men decided that
                    "Mr. Parker had failed to show good judgment and that his actions had seriously jeopardized
                    the College." They decided that Parker's "usefulness to the College was
                    at an end."58
            
            The following day an emergency meeting of the executive committee of the board of trustees concurred
                    with the recommendation of Hale's ad hoc group and voted to dismiss Parker. The executive
                    committee was "aware of the community's reaction" and "felt it
                    imperative to request Mr. Parker's immediate resignation."59

                        Evansville
                     College leaders faced was a popular joke which soon circulated around the campus. It
                    was said that the head of a refrigerator manufacturing company in town had told the college they had
                    better fire Parker quickly or his company would be "making refrigerators in the
                    college's new engineering building."60
            
            On April 8, the firing was officially announced at a special meeting of the faculty. Parker was
                    absent, having gone to address a dinner for honor students at a local high school. When he returned
                    to his house from his speaking engagement at 9:15 p.m., he went as requested to Hale's
                    office, where he was asked to resign. When Parker refused, Hale informed him that he was dismissed
                    from his teaching position. Because he believed he was unjustly punished for exercising his right of
                    free speech, Parker telegraphed the central office of the AAUP that he had been fired, requesting
                    "intervention by the Association" to save his job.61
            
            News of Parker's firing created a storm on campus. Hale announced to the local news media
                    that "owing to Parker's political activities, both

                     on and off the campus, his usefulness to 
                        Evansville
                     College was at an end." Parker's political work off campus was well
                    known to local newspaper readers, but few were aware of the allegations that he had distributed
                    Wallace literature among his students. Regarding Parker's rights, Hale added, 
                        The college fully subscribes to the principle of academic freedom, but believes that the
                            individual who exercises the privilege must assume the responsibility for his utterances and
                            actions when they destroy confidence and faith in the institution of which he is a member.
                            It is evident from the remonstrances received from the people of this community, including
                            business, civic and social leaders of 
                                Evansville
                            , that Mr. Parker has alienated himself to such a degree that the college, in
                            discharging its responsibility to its constituency, cannot subject its students directly or
                            indirectly to his influence.62
                  
                    
            
            The day after Parker's firing a large group of 
                        Evansville
                     students, acting, according to an 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Courier reporter, "in what they termed defense of free speech,"
                    demonstrated against Hale's action. By 11 a.m., eight hundred students were packed on the
                    lawn in front of the 
                        Evansville
                     College administration building. The meeting quickly turned into a hostile debate
                    between pro- and anti-Parker students. When the exchange grew hot, college trustee Richard
                    Rosencranz was called to speak to the crowd. Taking a neutral stance, Rosencranz told the students
                    crowded around him, "I think you are dealing with the delicate problem of how far freedom
                    of speech can go. I approve of everybody having the right to speak. Whether you can use the time
                    paid by the college to promote political ends is questionable." Rosencranz then added that
                    he did not like quick decisions any more than the students did and that he did not think it was his
                    place to defend the action. While some then cried out for Hale, nobody went to his office to ask him
                    to speak.63 One group of students, calling for a general strike until Parker was
                    reinstated, was shouted down by the others.
            Leading the student demonstration against Parker was Durham, the conservative "Field
                    Marshal" columnist. Durham told the students it was up to them to defend the
                    college's reputation: "The first thing we must consider is 
                        Evansville
                     College. It mustn't suffer any more than it already has. Our first loyalty is
                    to the college, not necessarily to the administration. This is where we'll get our
                    degrees." Durham argued that Parker's offense was his political extremism:
                    "The college has no rule which says a professor may not drink. I know some of them who do,
                    because I have drunk with them. On the other hand, the college couldn't afford to have one
                    of its professors found drunk in the streets. Such differentiation between drinking and drunkenness
                    is the same as differentiating between a man's right to his political beliefs and the sort
                    of 'political binge' which Mr. Parker went on." At this point Durham
                    added a sinister element to his accusation:

                     "I believe Parker represents a group which uses the
                    constitution and its rights to gain a position in which they may destroy the
                        constitution."64

                        Montgomery
                     agreed with Durham and made another damaging accusation.
            
                    Those people who say he didn't express his opinion on politics in classes are wrong. I
                        had him for logic class, and sometimes Wallace was discussed all period long. He brought
                        pro-Wallace literature to class and laid it on his desk. He didn't force it on anybody,
                        but he said it was there if anybody wanted it. My point is not whether he should be fired for
                        doing it or not, but merely that he did do it.65
               
                
            Durham and his allies did not stand unopposed. Suddenly many students rose up to defend
                    Parker—or at least his right to free speech. Bob Mowson argued that it was a question of
                    principle. "I wonder if he'd have been asked to resign if he'd been
                    backing Taft or Truman?" he asked, and the students cheered. Mowson added, "When
                    in the classroom, he is primarily a teacher. I've talked to many who say he has leaned over
                    backward to avoid this sort of thing. It's a question of whether a man can be fired because
                    he doesn't agree with the majority." Robert Echols observed that "it
                    seems that [Parker] disagrees with the political beliefs of the businessmen of 
                        Evansville
                    ." Others complained about the "pressure" brought to bear
                    upon the board of trustees by its financial backers. Don Ellenstein, a senior, charged,
                    "The financial factors that are backing Dr. Hale's expansion program have put
                    pressure on him to force the discharge of Parker. And when things come to the point where financial
                    factors tell the school who it can hire, what it can teach, and policies that it should follow, then
                    it's time, I feel, for students and citizens of this city to take steps to keep our
                    education free." Perhaps the primary reason students supported Parker was stated by a
                    conservative student: "I don't agree with Parker and I wouldn't give
                    Wallace all the flies he could eat… but I will defend [Parker's] right to free
                        speech."66
            
            The campus was also divided by a feud of sorts between Durham and the editors of the school paper.
                    Durham represented the views of the veterans' group on campus, and his columns often
                    attacked the "carping liberals" whom he considered to be the campus intellectual
                    in-crowd. Things came to a head when chief editor Charles Palmisano refused to print a Durham column
                    in which the "Field Marshal" attacked a "pro-leftist element on
                    campus," meaning Parker. The piece criticized "Parker's politics as well
                    as his method of teaching the bible." In response to the editor's decision, Durham
                    quit the paper and posted several copies of a letter explaining his reasons for resigning. Palmisano
                    and the other editors of the Crescent quickly clarified their position in a campus
                    letter of their own, in which they sought to 
                  
                            64
                            Ibid.

                            Ibid.
                        
               
                     present the Parker dismissal in a larger, national context.
                    "This does not concern George Parker; it concerns every American, but particularly 
                        Evansville
                     College students. Mr. Parker was fired because he engaged in his constitutional right
                    of free speech."67
            
            At the end of the campus meeting, demonstrators agreed to choose six students to investigate the
                    charges against Parker and to report to the student body. The investigators split evenly on their
                    recommendation, after which the student body voted to circulate petitions to "determine the
                    consensus of the students."68 The result was 324 for dismissal, 234
                    against. The pro-Parker group claimed "the small number of names on the petitions indicated
                    a fear prevalent in the student body that the signers of the pro-Parker petition would have serious
                    consequences for their signings."69
            
            Local public opinion regarding the Parker case "was immediate, extensive, and for the most
                    part intensely partisan."70 In editorials, both local papers supported
                    the firing. The Courier argued that "there is no question but that his
                    usefulness to the college has ended. He had become a distinct liability. This was the result of his
                    own course of action." The Press concurred, judging that
                    "acceptance of a teaching post involves the voluntary giving up of some privileges. We
                    would not like to see a college professor heading up the Taft-for-President committee, or the
                    Truman-for-President committee, or any other. Such action would automatically impair his usefulness
                    to the college."71
            
            Letters to the editor were divided and colorful. One especially vocal anti-Parker citizen declared,
                        
                        Mr. Parker is an American and should have rights as an American. But also as an American, to
                            enjoy these rights, I think he should have loyalty to America and not to some other country.
                            If he or anyone else does not like America then they should go to the country they prefer. 
                                Evansville
                             College hired Mr. Parker to teach religion, not Communism, politics, social
                            reform or anything else. When a man hires a painter to paint his house and instead he starts
                            cutting the lawn, then he can fire him. If 
                                Evansville
                             College finds that Mr. Parker is teaching politics or other things instead of
                            doing his job of teaching religion, then I, as many others do, think they have the civil
                            right as an American college to fire him for incompetence.
                     Another concerned citizen wrote, 
                        It certainly was a blow to learn that in our own 
                                Evansville
                             College we have a man supporting such a man as Wallace and what he stands for.
                            Mr. Parker was an assistant professor in philosophy and religion. What a spot for a Wallace
                            supporter, where all he had to do was talk. If I am not mistaken, that is the only way [a
                            Communist] can operate. It's his only weapon and it's one of the most
                            deadly.

                     however, were based on the belief that the young professor had
                    engaged in pro-Wallace propaganda in his classes. The AAUP's subsequent detailed
                    investigation clearly showed this to be false.
            Pro-Parker letters to local papers were just as numerous and outspoken. A worried alumnus criticized
                    the idea that an 
                        Evansville
                     College teacher of philosophy and religion should 
                        refrain from dealing with that very important, but naturally dangerous branch of his subject,
                            political philosophy.
                     This writer thought that 
                        Evansville
                     College's handling of the Parker affair was "indefensible on the
                    grounds of the college's own history and of a sound liberal academic policy. [The college]
                    cannot be separated from the most fundamental considerations of democracy in 
                        Evansville
                     and in the nation at large." One out-of-state group of alumni sent a telegram
                    to the Courier complaining that forcing Parker to resign because he supported
                    Wallace was "a shocking violation of academic freedom and civil liberties and must make
                    every graduate of 
                        Evansville
                     College ashamed of his alma mater. It is the kind of action we expect from fascist and
                    totalitarian communist alike, but not from an institution of higher education in a democratic
                    nation." Some local leaders were disturbed as well. O. H. Roberts, Jr., an 
                        Evansville
                     attorney and president of the state Junior Chamber of Commerce, labeled the Parker
                    firing "fairly reminiscent of the Nazi purges." At a local meeting of the group
                    Roberts asserted that "America is a free forum where people can speak what they
                        like."73
            
            Statewide, most objections to the Parker firing sprang from students and faculty of other Indiana
                    schools. The Indiana chapter of the AAUP quickly voiced its concern, declaring, "it is
                    particularly necessary in a period when political controversy and feeling run high to adhere firmly
                    to the principles of civil liberty and academic freedom and tenure for which the American
                    Association of University Professors stands."74 Soon the faculty and
                    student body of the state's flagship school, Indiana University, responded to the firing.
                    The Indiana Daily Student carried several articles about the case. One reader
                    congratulated the student newspaper for its 
                        fine coverage … of the dismissal of the Rev. George Parker from 
                                Evansville
                             College because of his affiliation with Henry Wallace …. The
                            question of academic freedom is of the greatest concern to all affiliates of university
                            life—especially now, when we are attempting to preserve democratic ideals
                            throughout the world. The dismissal of the Rev. Parker is, in effect, a violation of a
                            fundamental democratic concept under the pretext of preserving one. Let the Daily Student, as the voice of I.U.'s faculty and students, speak out
                            against injustice.75
                  
                    
            
            Roughly a week after Parker had been dismissed, the I.U. campus newspaper reported that "the
                    furor that hit 
                        Evansville

                     week concerning the dismissal of Dr. George Parker for his
                    'outside political activities' hit the I. U. campus yesterday with the
                    announcement of a student rally to protest the action." The article reported that student
                    representatives from 
                        Bloomington
                     and ten other Indiana universities and colleges would be traveling to 
                        Evansville
                     to talk to Hale. The group, Students for Academic Freedom, maintained that the issue
                    should not be Henry Wallace but "whether a citizen can present his views to the
                        public."76 In mid-May, ninety-one members of the Indiana University
                    faculty sent a letter addressed to Hale demanding that Parker be reinstated. The letter asserted
                    that "by [firing Parker] 
                        Evansville
                     College has disassociated itself from the values and traditions on which our democratic
                    and educational systems are founded. The issue is greater than the injustice to Dr.
                        Parker."77
            
            There was also national attention to the Parker firing. Wallace, in a speech in 
                        Chicago
                     on April 9, 1948, that was carried by newspapers nationwide claimed, "The real
                    violence at 
                        Evansville
                     was not the few uniformed young men who paraded, shouted, and stormed the doors of the
                    Coliseum …. The real violence was the firing of a young professor who takes seriously the
                    principles he teaches. Speech which costs a man his job isn't free speech."78
            
            Wallace elaborated on this theme in his column in the New Republic, under the title
                    "Terrorism at 
                        Evansville
                    ": 
                        Professor Parker's sin was that he presided at the meeting at which I spoke. He was
                            exercising his right as a citizen to work for peace in the best way he knew. Looking to the
                            future of our nation, I am much more concerned with the yielding to hysteria by timid
                            college authorities than with the acts of violence perpetrated by little people whose
                            passions are inflamed by bigots.
                        At the beginning of my speech at 
                                Evansville
                            , I said that we must not blame the boys who were banging at the door, but
                            rather the press, which had done its best to stir up hatred. After the meeting was over,
                            George Parker, who was to be dismissed from his position two days later, said to me:
                            "Mr. Wallace, I noticed you blamed the press for this unseemly performance here
                            tonight. I wonder if we who are in the teaching profession do not have our share of
                            blame."
                        Poor Parker! He takes the Bible, Christianity, and democracy seriously. Anyone who does that
                            in times like these is in for trouble. The men of reason, courage, and charity, who ask
                            "Why should there be war?" will continually be challenged by the men of
                            violence and hate, by those who sit snugly in positions of authority.79
                  
                    
            
            Other national periodicals offered their opinions on the firing as well. The 
                        Chicago
                    
                    Sun observed that "teachers who are supposed to train young people for
                    democracy cannot be expected to remain aloof from the democratic process, nor has anybody the right
                    to compel

                    Time magazine declared that "academic freedom shivered a little in the
                    anti-communist wind." The magazine also poked fun at 
                        Evansville
                     College's supposed support of "the principles of academic
                    freedom" in light of the Parker firing.81 The Atlantic
                        Monthly reported that Wallace supporters considered the Parker firing one more example of
                    "the stupid conduct of super patriots."82 The Christian Century spoke with concern of "the wide controversy" the
                    Parker case had generated. Methodist leaders expressed "deep concern" over the
                    dismissal of Parker by the Methodist-supported school. "The Methodist Church always has
                    supported full religious and political freedom of speech, thought, and action," an official
                    report noted.83
            
            Over the next two years, various publications discussed the firing. The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Recorder, a weekly newspaper published by African Americans, observed that
                    "it is difficult for many Americans to believe that we have one hundred percent freedom of
                    speech and the press, when they recall how Henry Wallace and his followers had so much difficulty in
                    obtaining speaking halls during the last presidential campaign and the firing of an 
                        Evansville
                     College professor for chairing a Wallace meeting."84
            
            Articles in academic journals expressed opinions on the issue as well. A writer in the Journal for Educational Sociology asked, "Is it wise to permit a teacher to be
                    coerced into voicing political views of only the dominant economic groups? For is he not obligated
                    to concern himself with the opinions of all strata of society, including the underprivileged at the
                    bottom of the social scale?"85 An essay in the Journal of
                        Higher Education noted that 
                        relatively few educational institutions enjoy complete academic freedom today…. It
                            is much safer to confine the curriculum to traditional, non-controversial subject-matter. It
                            is safer and easier. Pressure groups will not trouble us in that case.
                    
               86
            
            Overall, national opinion regarding Parker's firing seemed to be divided, although the AAUP
                    noted that "many editorials, perhaps a majority, deplored the dismissal of a college
                    professor for reasons stated by the administration of 
                        Evansville

                     important pronouncement about the case originated from the
                    extensive inquiry made by the AAUP in May 1948. Shortly after being contacted by Parker, the AAUP
                    had notified Hale of the organization's desire to clarify "the fads relating to
                    professor Parker's dismissal." Hale, knowing the importance to the school of
                    keeping its academic accreditation, responded quickly to the request, promising "full
                        cooperation."87 A committee of AAUP members arrived on campus on
                    May 1. From the beginning, both parties agreed that the primary point of reference for judging any
                    legitimate dismissal should be the AAUP's 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom
                    and Tenure.
            The final AAUP report made it clear that all information gathered in the study indicated that Parker
                    had not violated any AAUP guidelines in the classroom in his discussions of Wallace. The report
                    further noted that Parker's main misconduct in the eyes of the college involved his
                    off-campus work in behalf of the Wallace campaign, an activity well within his rights as an American
                    citizen. Indeed, as the report observed, a teacher would have '"no real freedom of
                    choice if he knew that by exercising that freedom he may invite punishment.'"88 Another disturbing aspect of Parker's treatment was that his case
                    was not handled with due process, which accredited schools were obligated to observe. The only
                    positive aspect noted by the AAUP investigators was that the college had paid Parker his full
                    contract for the next year. Based on this information, the committee recommended that 
                        Evansville
                     College be censured. In the conclusion of the report, the committee noted, 
                        Doubtless some who called for the dismissal of Professor Parker are now ashamed of their
                            unjustified alarm. Such repentance, however, cannot repair the damage done to the American
                            tradition of freedom and to 
                                Evansville
                             College, a damage which its administration could have prevented had it
                            possessed insight into the significance of intellectual freedom and courage to uphold those
                            principles that are indispensable to the welfare of higher education and of the public.89
                  
                    
            
            Fortunately for 
                        Evansville
                     College, the AAUP censure was directed at Hale and the school's
                    administration. Upon Hale's retirement in the mid-1950s, the censure was removed. The
                    Parker case quickly faded from local, state, and national memory after a rash of McCarthy-Era
                    university and college firings swept the nation. Five years after the Parker incident, Dean Carl
                    Ackerman of 
                        Columbia
                     University captured a sense of the traumatic effect of the Red Scare on education when
                    he noted, "Today the vast majority of teachers … have learned that promotion and
                    security depend upon conforming to the prevailing … concept of devotion to the public
                        welfare."90

            Parker fared better than some others who were dismissed for their beliefs. He secured a position at 
                        Berea

                        Kentucky

                  Louisville, Kentucky
               , on August 25, 1998, and was survived by his wife.91 The old

               Speaking before the Indiana Association of Historians in spring 2001, historian David
                        Thelen called for a new approach to historical research and education. The IMH recently asked Thelen to elaborate on those remarks; his response follows. The IMH also invited three educators and museum professionals to share their thoughts on the
                        essay and its relation to the work of bringing history to public audiences. Participants in this
                        web-based conversation, a transcript of which follows Thelen's essay, included: Lonnie
                        Bunch, president, 
                            Chicago
                         Historical Society; Timothy Crumrin, associate director for research, Conner 
                            Prairie
                        ; and William Munn, an IMH editorial board member and high school
                        history teacher in

            History poses a profoundly troubling paradox in American culture. On the one hand, there has never
                    been greater popular interest in history—expressed in genealogy, reunions, museums,
                    films. On the other, academic historians lament shrinking audiences for their scholarship, and
                    surveys report that Americans do not recognize people or events from American history. In our book,
                        The Presence of the Past: Popular Uses of History in American Life (1998), Roy
                    Rosenzweig and I used survey research to try to map popular uses and understandings of the past. Our
                    results led us to a similarly exciting and paradoxical conclusion: Americans use the past actively
                    and critically to live their lives, but they feel disconnected from and distrustful toward
                    "history" where they usually encounter it, in school.1
            
            In this article I want to propose how by reconfiguring our understanding of history around individual
                    experience and re-enactment we can develop a fresh perspective for connecting professional, civic,
                    pedagogic, and personal practices of history-making. Such a perspective can provide starting places
                    for widening the discipline of history to better fulfill its potential to help students understand
                    themselves, frame and make choices in life, learn from and empathize with others, think critically,
                    and become active, autonomous citizens.

                                New York
                            , 1998).
               
                     I will suggest how history classrooms, which many Americans
                    experience as alienating, could become places for learning lifetime skills. With such an approach
                    the dramatic change in the content of history over the past generation, which has included an
                    increasing concern for the lives of people once overlooked by historians, might be better matched by
                    a comparable broadening in history's core disciplinary practice.
            Before going further I want to acknowledge that I use the term "re-enactment" with
                    reluctance, because for many historians it conjures up images of escapist amateurs playing soldier.
                    I use it, however, because it describes a wide variety of practices in contemporary life. Indeed,
                    the exciting (and difficult) part of exploring re-enactment is that practices built around
                    re-enactment—from Alcoholics Anonymous to movements for reparations for slavery or
                    personal apologies for things a person regrets, from Civil War re-enactments to religious
                    conversion, psychotherapy, and restorative justice—have developed in such isolation from
                    each other that practitioners in one arena have rarely recognized terrain they share with those in
                    another. "Individual experience", is a thorny term for many, too, and I use it
                    because it is the most commonsensical term people use as they go about life (and talk with
                    interviewers about how they use the past). And at a time when Americans find institutions generally
                    unresponsive, many people turn to total immersion in experience—"the experience
                    economy" or "experiential learning"—to transform commerce,
                    civics, and education into more familiar terms.2
            
            
                    Challenges of History Education
                
            In thinking about how to broaden history to help people use it more actively and naturally, I want to
                    begin with what many people have found most troubling about their school experiences. For the past
                    century the sources of alienation people report about history classes have changed very little over
                    time or place. Students lament that history education usually centers on an "alienated body
                    of facts" that some mysterious authority has collected and arranged chronologically and
                    then expected students to memorize for exams. A National Education Association committee complained
                    as early as 1916 that "the traditional history course has given to the child a mass of
                    facts, chronologically arranged, because in the judgment of the adult, these facts may sometime be
                    useful, or for the purposes of that vague thing, 'general culture.'" And
                    a survey of 32,000 students in twenty-seven European countries in the 1990s disclosed that the
                    learning of facts was the highest priority of their history classes. What was worse, in 
                  
                     2Joseph H. Pine and James H. Gilmore, The Experience
                                Economy: Work is Theatre and Every Business a Stage (
                                Boston
                            , 1999).
               
                     1917 as in 1987, surveys showed that American students had
                    failed to "learn" the facts history was supposed to teach.3
            
            The second major complaint was that history centered on an "official" narrative,
                    most commonly of acts organized around the fate of the nation-state: its birth, its tribulations,
                    its acquisition of territory, institutions, and values. History provided the
                    "official" story that young citizens were supposed to learn about their collective
                        identity.4 Indeed, Thomas C. Holt has observed that the greatest problem
                    with historical narratives "is not that these narratives are necessarily inaccurate, but
                    simply that they are closed, stunted versions" and thereby "misrepresent the
                    dynamism" people experienced in the past while they "shut down the learning
                    process at the very place it might begin." More broadly, as many theorists have noted,
                    narrative structure was designed to corral what people experience as sprawling and open-ended.5
            
            Our interviews with hundreds of Americans confirmed that the most formidable barrier Americans
                    experience in using history in schools is that they come upon it as something completed and
                    fished—subject to argument and changing interpretation to be sure, but still over. Many
                    people find this a barrier because they have learned that, in order to use the past in their daily
                    lives, they must reinhabit the open-endedness they experienced when they originally went through an
                    experience. By making experiences open-ended, we make them arenas of choice at the time, and later
                    of taking responsibility. Carl Jung urged people to excavate their experiences so they could turn
                    what had been frozen in time into moments of choice for which they could then take responsibility.
                    The process of using the past becomes one not of trying to corral its open-endedness but of trying
                    to pry it open wider and keep it open, to experience our uses not as finished products but as
                    ongoing inquiries. Such a process is already central to many institutional and cultural practices
                    that help people become more creative and responsible users of the past. Many people we interviewed
                    looked to the past to try to figure out where they had come from and were heading, what they wanted
                    to pass on to others before they died, how to find and hold onto other people, and above

                     all how to make a difference in and take responsibility for
                    their lives and those of others.6 The basic challenge to history education is to
                    imagine how students could engage history in the same open-ended ways that they use as they confront
                    the past in their everyday lives.
            
                    Rethinking Individual Experience and Agency in History
                
            Before we can develop a plan for a history education that proceeds from the open-endedness of human
                    experiences we need to step back and look at the heavy burden that the discipline carries from its
                    origins. Hayden White has observed that the founding understandings that go into creating a cultural
                    tool (such as the study of history) continue to inhibit its uses thereafter: "Every
                    discipline … is … constrained by what it forbids its
                    practitioners to do …. Every discipline is made up of a set of restrictions on thought
                    and imagination, and none is more hedged about with taboos than professional
                        historiography."7
            
            The first modern historians established a framework in the early nineteenth century that continues to
                    constrain how historians see individuals and their experiences. In place of the
                    Enlightenment's quest for timeless and universal patterns of thinking and acting, these
                    historians posited irreducible social or historical masses, driven by collective emotions and
                    traditions, which shaped institutions, cultures, and especially nation-states. They maintained that
                    those new nation-states, cultures, and collectivities should shape the identities, compel the
                    loyalties, and fulfill the aspirations of individuals. This vision looks strange in retrospect
                    because the founding historians were submerging individuals into collectivities at the very moment
                    when novelists and biographers were discovering and releasing individuality from collective
                    constraints, often putting individuals into conflict with their surrounding cultures. At this very
                    moment that Ralph Waldo Emerson called "the age of the first person singular,"
                    historians made nation-states, cultures and institutions the real agents and actors in history.
                    Instead of looking at how individuals experienced their movement through time, the first historians
                    thought the larger "Zeitgeist" of surrounding time and place was the thing to be
                    explained. They froze individuals into interchangeable and largely invisible pieces set into motion
                    by larger things historians called "historical perspective" and
                    "historical context." Many postmodern theorists have further extended this
                    dismissal of individual experience as random, shallow, private, and even self-deceptive by insisting
                    that the broad "discourse" of a particular time and place shapes what individuals
                    mean by what they say and do. Indeed,

            To shift our starting point from collectivities to individuals, we need to replace the starting
                    assumption that individuals are shaped by circumstances and institutions with a question: How do
                    individuals use cultures and institutions as "tools," to use James
                    Wertsch's term, to frame and solve problems, to be able to see and do more, to gather
                    resources and make a difference? Or, to invert this perspective, we could start with the classic
                    formulation of the problem posed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Individuals make their own
                    histories but they do it under circumstances only partly of their own making. We would next add
                    Jean-Paul Sartre's observation that while time, place, and circumstance may indeed frame
                    the choices which individuals experience and which determine their lives, those larger circumstances
                    are not facts of nature. Individuals experience, name, construct, and frame choices differently in
                    response to the same circumstances. To Sartre's modification I would add one more:
                    Individuals construct from time, place, and circumstance not determinants of their behavior but
                    horizons of possibility and constraint, including relationships, pressures, and conventions from
                    which they frame choices and take responsibility for them. They create these horizons not as
                    isolated beings or interchangeable members of cultures or institutions but, as Norbert Elias
                    observed, in elastic, variable, and changeable face-to-face relationships with other individuals.9
            
            While group leaders might draw circles around poles of collective identity to try to keep a
                    group's members from straying and strangers from entering, many individuals describe living
                    their lives "betwixt and between" poles. Many Americans inhabit borderlands along
                    seemingly contested divisions between African and American, Republican and Democrat, gay and
                    straight. Individuals choose among potential allegiances to locate themselves. A woman might
                    identify with her experiences as a woman, lawyer, Democrat, Chicagoan, lesbian, Polish-American,
                    twenty-something, Catholic, college graduate, human being. To describe any one of these groups would
                    be to fall far short of describing the multi-faceted individual. "[A] man has as many
                    different social selves as there are distinct groups of persons about whose

                     opinion he cares," William James explained. Early
                    twentieth-century sociologists like Charles H. Cooley and George Herbert Mead described how
                    individuals construct and play various social roles, in various social circumstances, to explore
                    which ones fit most comfortably. Later, Robert Jay Lifton described how individuals try on different
                    identities and roles as they seek to balance a need for coherence as an individual with a desire to
                    explore their many sides10 We can experience each of these roles to explore
                    another piece of our individuality even while we try to retain our coherence as individuals.
            As they explore their individuality, people negotiate their cultures' constructions of
                    appropriate and inappropriate individual behavior. Individuality may have emerged with the
                    Renaissance, as Jacob Burkhardt believed. A positive sense of the modern self may have first
                    appeared in the mid-nineteenth century. Authenticity may have first become a discursive possibility
                    around the turn of the twentieth century. Keywords like "freedom" and
                    "liberty" changed. But at all times individuals could find cultural constructions
                    liberating or oppressive, irrational or consoling. Indeed, Wertsch encourages us to focus on the
                    tension between individual agent and the cultural tool that the agent is using.11
            
            While critics such as Joan Scott who have cautioned against use of experience as a category may have
                    fairly challenged essentialism—the educational theory that all students should be taught
                    the essential elements of their culture through traditional methods—I believe that we
                    still need to focus further on how individuals frame and make choices.12 In so
                    doing, we can reaffirm our subject's basic insight: that in passing through an experience,
                    whether the divorce of parents or the civil rights movement, people explore whether (and how) the
                    experience might change them and how they might change the thing they were passing through.

            In 1946 the English historian R. G. Collingwood assigned the term "re-enactment" to
                    a process of re-experiencing the past.13 I do not

                     mean exactly the same thing as Collingwood, but I will use his
                    term-although "re-experience" or "re-inhabit" would also
                    work—to name my proposal for history education. The basic purpose of re-enactment is to
                    challenge the notion that history is about events that are over, closed. Re-enactment becomes a
                    means to open events that look closed, to see possibilities, to frame choices, and above all to help
                    us recognize how individuals, in the past and present, contain within them capacities that we can
                    both uncover and exercise.
            Let me illustrate what I mean by citing three groups, each the subject of my own recent research,
                    that make re-enactment the core of their attempts to accomplish transformative change in areas of
                    personal development, civics, and education:
            The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) provides a dramatic case of re-enactment
                    framing civic agency and choice. The TRC re-enacted confrontations from the past, forcing
                    perpetrators, victims, and bystanders to figure out what choices they faced in the past, what they
                    wished they had done, and what they wanted to do now to take responsibility for what they did. At
                    its heart re-enactment was designed to lay bare, in the TRC's words, "the little
                    perpetrator in each of us" and to force individuals to explore how they could experience
                    the roles of victims, perpetrators, or bystanders at the same time. The TRC hoped that individual
                    re-enactment and taking of responsibility for the past were the best means for moving from apartheid
                    to democracy and thus for inspiring people to take responsibility for creating a culture of human
                        rights.14 The TRC's challenge to citizens to weigh their
                    responsibility for the past can ultimately move them toward a more democratic and active civics.
                    Like several Dutch commissions that have questioned the Netherlands' role in failing to
                    protect Jews from Nazis, Muslims from Serbs, and Indonesians from Dutch war criminals, such public
                    approaches to historical responsibility intersect what Dana Villa calls "Socratic
                    citizenship": the very hard work of questioning the framing made by others and developing
                    one's own individual moral civics.15

                    how best to immerse people in another time and place. In its award-winning Follow the
                        North Star program, visitors play the role of runaway slaves in 1836, as they negotiate the

                     runaways might have met. Many visitors report that the
                    experience is overwhelmingly intense, as they try to frame and make choices first in their roles as
                    slaves in 1836, and then as present-day citizens wondering about their responsibility for slavery
                    and its consequences. Living-history museums have generated a rich literature on the theory and
                    practice of how to challenge visitors with the differentness of the past in ways that often lead
                    them to discover new things about themselves in the present.16
            
            Alcoholics Anonymous, with 92,000 chapters the largest self-help movement in the world today,
                    provides another model for re-enactment and responsibility. Rejecting formal institutional
                    mechanisms, outside professional guidance, or political programs, AA provides opportunities for
                    members to recreate and share their experiences of struggling with drink and addiction. The central
                    challenge for AA, as for all twelve-step treatments, is a "serenity prayer" that
                    succinctly summarizes the challenges of fixing agency: "God grant me the serenity to accept
                    the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the
                    difference." Reporting their struggles to transform themselves from their hurtful behavior
                    of the past, participants often describe a need to return to and take responsibility for the grief
                    they have caused. Step Eight calls on them "to make a list of all persons we had harmed and
                    become willing to make amends to them all," while Step Nine directs them to make amends to
                    such people.17
            
            These three diverse forms of re-enactment underscore the importance of two central points in the task
                    of reconfiguring history education around re-enactment. First, I suggest that history students
                    should recreate and then re-experience the open-endedness that participants faced in particular
                    historical moments. They would "recreate the uncertainty and flux of the moment,"
                    in William Reddy's phrase: the colliding memories and anticipations that accompanied
                    passage through what T. S. Eliot described as "a lifetime burning in every
                        moment."18 By creating and then inhabiting these challenging
                    moments, students would experience for themselves both the realms of choice and the historical
                    horizon that people face in the present as well as the past. Playing the roles of people in the past
                    would make

                     them conscious of the open-ended fluidity of experience,
                    allowing them to use unfamiliar challenges from the past to understand themselves better. While
                    emphasizing that external circumstances and discourses are contested and do change over time,
                    re-enactment advocates since Giambattista Vico in eighteenth-century Naples have insisted that we
                    are able to learn from history because we can recognize across time the open-endedness that other
                    human beings confront, and the creativity they express, as they pass through experiences.
                    "Every word, every sentence, every gesture or polite formula, every work of art and every
                    historical deed is intelligible because the people who express themselves through them and those who
                    understand them have something in common," wrote Wilhelm Dilthey in early twentieth-century
                    Berlin: 
                        The individual always experiences, thinks and acts in a common sphere and only there does he
                            understand. Everything that is understood carries, as it were, the hallmark of familiarity
                            derived from such common features.
                    
               19 This ability to re-experience open-endedness provides the starting
                    point for re-enactment to challenge students to reach deeply within themselves.
            Second, I suggest that students should explore how people go on to reconsider what they actually said
                    or did in the past, a process that may unleash a flood of feelings like pride, regret, grief, guilt,
                    self-doubt, or anger. As people reconsider, they can choose how to act—to apologize,
                    re-pair, re-nege, re-habilitate, re-cant, re-venge. All these acts help people to take
                    responsibility for consequences of past actions—their own and their
                    societies'—and to reassure themselves or others of how they will face such
                    actions in the future. Over the past half-century there has been a rapid spread of processes by
                    which even nations make amends for actions they now regret, as the United States did with its
                    apology and reparations, in the 1980s, to Japanese-Americans interned in camps in the 1940s.20
            
            The goal of such an educational program, then, is to help students explore and develop individual
                    capacities for framing choices and taking responsibility for what they or others have done. To widen
                    their repertoire of experiences beyond their own, I propose "transporting"
                    students into hard problems in the past, there to grapple with issues that in turn widen the range
                    of personal qualities of temperament and agency they can recognize and use in their own lives. More
                    particularly, let me propose a process for carrying this out.
            We might start with an exercise in which students reflect on how they frame horizons of possibility
                    and constraint in relation to a real problem in their everyday lives. Then they would observe how

                     someone else, preferably with "other" social
                    circumstances or cultural backgrounds, seeks to frame the same or a similar problem. They would not
                    only sharpen their own skills for framing horizons but also explore how individuals face choices
                    about what roles to play, what resources or traditions to draw on, how to use cultural materials to
                    widen, not narrow, repertoires of problem-solving. And, with as rich a use of ethnographic skills as
                    a teacher could present, they would reflect on how they and others can see or create wider
                    possibilities for framing or acting.21
            
            For the next steps, we would turn to more conventional historical subjects and materials. Students
                    might identify the kinds of voices and sources they need in order to see how a particular person in
                    the past framed a problem. Then they would gather and use documents and artifacts to recreate as
                    fully as possible the horizon of possibility and constraint participants might have
                    faced—including the kinds of pressures participants felt to move in one or another
                    direction. A good recreation of experiences of slaves, for instance, would convey why slaves ran
                    away or did not run away. We would see Abraham Lincoln agonizing with his conflicting feelings and
                    moralities as he searched for words to answer Stephen Douglas in a debate for a Senate seat in 1858.
                    We would see Thomas Jefferson and Henry Laurens agonize—and come to different
                    conclusions—as revolutionary patriots about how to apply Jefferson's phrase,
                    "all men are created equal," to their ownership of Africans as slaves.
            Following this stage, students would take roles in a situation they recreate. Role-playing has a rich
                    history in school classrooms, in part because it originates not in historical pedagogy but in
                    everyday life, where people try out various roles to see how others react and how they feel about
                    it. By moving among roles an agent can try on various historically and socially constructed roles
                    for addressing problems that existed at different times. The trick in successful role-playing would
                    be to construct challenging problems that drive students deeply into themselves. They should wonder:
                    What makes this situation so tough? What can I, or we, do about it? What internal resources do I, or
                    we, have to frame and choose amid the open-endedness of personal experience?
            The next step would be for students to imagine themselves in a similar situation today and compare
                    how they framed the earlier situation with the present one. In moving back and forth across time,
                    they would explore how framing and choosing have changed or remained constant, how time and place
                    shape what people experience as conventional or unconventional. Instead of focusing on the evils of
                    present-mindedness, students would explore similarities and differences in how people experienced
                    and constructed larger circumstances. 
                  
                     21I am indebted to Henry Glassie, College Professor of Folklore,
                            Indiana University, for this suggestion.
               
                     They would share Wilhelm Dilthey's recognition that
                    individuals experience and create things differently at different times and places but also that
                    they could re-experience what others had gone through (nacherleben) because they
                    underwent what Dilthey called "the rediscovery of the I in the Thou."22 The point of comparing past with present is to hone skills of opening the
                    widest range of choices.
            The final step in this process of connecting past with present would be for students to imagine how
                    today they might take responsibility for their own or others' earlier decisions. They would
                    explore a range of civic institutions and personal perspectives—such as those I have
                    mentioned here—that people have developed to frame the act of taking responsibility for
                    the past.
            Clearly, we have a responsibility to build on the tremendous popular enthusiasm for history. By
                    infusing historical teaching with the open-endedness of human experience, we can make the past an
                    active tool for engaging the present.

            IMH: Based on the people whom you see in your classrooms, museums, or historic sites, what evidence
                    do you see for David Thelen's contention that we face a "profoundly troubling
                    paradox" in the ways in which people learn about and understand history?
            Timothy Crumrin: I agree that there is often a "disconnect" between the average
                    person and what they see as "history." For example, a comment we often hear from
                    our museum visitors is that they did not know history could be so interesting, that they thought it
                    was just names and dates, and saw no connection with their own lives. Part of that problem stems
                    from how people "define" history. If they see it merely as
                    "isms," strings of dates, or great overarching movements taught by a
                    "dry" teacher, instead of seeing the human face (and thus their own face) of
                    history, the chances of this disconnect are greater. If they were taught by an inspiring teacher
                    (and they are many and their ranks are growing) who uses diverse methods to bring the subject
                    "alive" and show the connections between the past, present,

                            Dilthey, Descriptive Psychology and Historical Understanding (The Hague,
                            Netherlands, 1977), 123-44, and Dilthey, Meaning in History and Society (
                                London
                            , 1961).
               
                     and future, or if they have family or friends who instill a
                    love and understanding of history, then they are a receptive audience/participant in learning and
                    valuing the topic.
            Much work has been done on various learning styles and obviously many approaches are needed. The
                    "old-fashioned" way of lectures and reading assignments does not work alone. This
                    is not to devalue that paradigm (indeed, it is a method I flourished under), but there are other
                    methods, such as role-playing (reenactment), hands-on learning, and interactive technologies, that
                    should all be a part of the mix.
            I think public history has much to offer the classroom in terms of how to present history. Museums
                    and other historical agencies have long-established methods for drawing in visitors and making them
                    part of a learning experience. These continue to evolve. In fact, Comer 
                        Prairie
                     has just begun a new initiative called "Opening Doors," in which
                    "visitor engagement" is considered an essential component of good interpretation
                    and education. The idea is to pique interest in many ways. These include hands-on means (handing
                    them a fur as a way of leading into an interpretation of the fur trade and Indian-White relations,
                    for example) and "minds-on" means (such as asking visitors to compare an aspect of
                    their lives with those of others who lived in the past).
            I am unsure if the options discussed above are "redefining" or simply
                    "refining" how we connect people with the past, but I believe active participation
                    can be an element in that task. We are in a (probably short-lived) period in which
                    "history" is "sexy"—as evidenced by the History
                    Channel, interest in family history, etc.—and as historians, we need to finds ways to
                    capitalize on it.
            Lonnie Bunch: As a historian who has spent most of his career in museums, I hear from a myriad of
                    visitors how important history is to their families and to their communities. Almost immediately,
                    however, they say, "I never really enjoyed the history that I experienced in high school
                    and college." For nearly a decade museums have realized that a key to their success is to
                    provide visitors with personal encounters with the past that allow them to see themselves as actors
                    in the great pageant that is history.
            In some ways, museums have struggled to find ways for the public to "own" the past.
                    There have been some real successes, especially with adult audiences. Exhibitions that draw from
                    more recent history, that are rife with the personal stories that flow from the effective use of
                    oral history, have contributed to a better understanding of the uses and the importance of history
                    for a general audience. Also, exhibitions that explicitly link the past with the present, such as
                    the National Museum of American History's recent Between a Rock and a Hard
                        Place: The History of Sweatshops in America, have engaged audiences in ways that schools
                    can only envy.
            
            Unfortunately, museums have not consistently found ways to distance themselves from the
                    public's sense of boredom with the traditional approaches to the past. Many museums are
                    venerated but rarely visited. The attendance of many of the major urban history museums is
                    surprisingly low. While museums have made great strides in serving and engaging audiences, I remain
                    unconvinced that cultural institutions have really discovered ways to bridge the chasm between the
                    public's personal interest in the past and their distaste with the traditional ways in
                    which the past is taught and made accessible.
            William Munn: Thelen correctly defines the paradox: popular history is hot, academic history is
                    not—at least in the eyes of the general public. The author points to a renewed enthusiasm
                    for museums, genealogy, and films as indicative of this growing audience. This is contrasted with
                    the general public disaffection toward history as taught in the classroom.
            It seems to me that both sides of the issue call for some analysis. Who is the audience for museums
                    and other history providers? Are they taking part in the "gentrification" of vital
                    topics? What is the story being told, and how is it selected? Would the audience sit still for a
                    re-enactment of the Nat Turner revolt, the Pullman strike, or the 
                        Marion
                     lynching? Do people really use the past actively and critically to live their lives or
                    is history used to support conventional world views?
            Thelen is on target in his critique of the public's "disconnect" and
                    distrust of history as it taught in school. The subject has been presented as being close-ended.
                    Discussion often is reduced to recitation and trivial pursuit. Having said that, it is my experience
                    that many teachers, sometimes at their own peril, have ventured forth into "making
                    experiences open-ended."
            Coming out of college in the 1960s, I was convinced that it was my obligation to open up the closed
                    areas. As many will recall, the public, through school officials, became very much opposed to this
                    approach. To be fair, some of what was done deserved criticism. Yet the long-term result was a
                    return to the standard narrative method.
            What was missed, I think, and what Thelen correctly points out, was the connection of the
                    "personal" with the historical. Using Frederick Douglass's writings to
                    reflect on our own views on race and society, studying the history of our own home, interviewing
                    grandfather about his experiences at Iwo Jima, or traveling the Underground Railroad at Conner 
                        Prairie
                     can serve to make that connection. I also believe that by involving the public in these
                    discussions, we can help turn mistrust and suspicion into support and understanding.
            IMH: Each of you has spoken to the problems that you encounter as you try to get people to think of
                    historical experience as more than  a closed body of facts. And
                    all of you have hinted at specific projects or general techniques—in your own classrooms
                    and museums or elsewhere—that you believe have overcome this problem. Could you tell us
                    more about what has worked for you? Where have you been able to reach people in a visceral way that
                    corresponds to Thelen's notion of "reenactment"?

                    palpable aura of menace) North Star attempts to draw participants into another
                    "reality." How well it succeeds is rather easily measurable in the debriefing
                    sessions that follow. In these sessions participants share not only their reactions and emotions,
                    but what they have learned about history and themselves. One of the most common comments is that
                    they were forced to think about the decisions that had to be made and their possible consequences
                    and felt an empathy with those in the past. The "facts" of slavery and interracial
                    relationships become more than words on a page or concepts, they become internalized and analyzed.
            Though the most intense, North Star is just one of our immersion programs. Another
                    is the 
                  
                            Fall Creek
                         Massacre Trial, in which visitors observe a recreation of the trial of those
                    charged with the murder of Native Americans and act as the jury. In our Weekend on the
                        Farm program participants adopt personas created for them, spending up to three days and
                    two nights living on our 1886 farm. They not only experience the physical world (privies and chamber
                    pots instead of bathrooms, wood stove in lieu of a microwave) but also gain insight into daily life.
            It should be noted that immersion may also be achieved by simpler means. Day-to-day living history
                    interpretation allows for it. By merely taking part in a conversation with an interpreter (Conner 
                        Prairie
                    's term for its docents or characters) visitors become part of a reenactment.
                    This "conversation" is in essence one that takes place in a moment in time; it is
                    open-ended, as our characters do not "know" the future.
            What should not be lost in all this discussion of new ways to engage people with history is the
                    inherent importance of basic education about the past in conjunction with immersion. In other words,
                    to use a loaded term, the "facts." Not an "alienated body of
                    facts," but a basic knowledge both for knowledge's sake and for the sake of
                    providing context for the reenactment. Museums are certainly able to do this (all of the programs
                    mentioned above have varying degrees of "preprogram education" elements attached
                    to them), but seldom at the level or depth that can be obtained over the course of days and months
                    in the classroom. That is why a marriage of these old and new paradigms can be such a powerful
                    educational tool. The more  information about the past the
                    participants have, the richer the reenactment experience—as a means both of learning
                    about history and learning about themselves. Without at least a basic historical grounding, it
                    devolves into a sort of "history as therapy." This may work in a self-help sort of
                    way, but it does little to advance the cause of history or our understanding of it.
            WM: A couple of examples come to mind. I have had success with students interviewing older community
                    members of the World War II generation for an oral history project. Students then presented their
                    work to fellow students, community members, and to the subjects and their families. I recall a
                    student interview of a former POW who had spent two years in a German prison camp. At the end of the
                    student presentation, the man was given a very tearful standing ovation. Another student interviewed
                    a group of older African Americans about their experiences growing up in a segregated 
                        Marion
                    , Indiana. There was total silence in the group when the humiliations endured by the
                    folks were recounted. I believe that the connection that Thelen describes was made.
            On a less dramatic level, it has been my experience that the teacher can, through careful selection
                    of primary source documents and reflective discussion and writing, involve students more deeply in
                    the past. I was thinking of very intense discussions of selections from W. E. B. Du Bois, Thomas
                    Jefferson, or Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Such discussions reach a level of importance only when we get
                    to the part where the material's personal significance is shared. I guess it is the old
                    "modeling" theory. If you want students now, and later adults, to use history in
                    this way, the process must be modeled in the classroom. It is my belief that if this is not done
                    there, it will not be done elsewhere.
            IMH: Thus far, we've treated Thelen's comments primarily in terms of what they
                    suggest about ways of conveying historical information. But could not the
                    "re-enactment" approach, as outlined here, apply as much to the process of
                    historical research as it does to education? I'd be curious to hear any examples that you
                    think point not just to new curriculum and exhibition techniques but to a new understanding of the
                    past.
            TC: I think most historians have always incorporated at least some of the elements of reenactment.
                    They just might use different terms, such as "empathy" or "understanding
                    context." Again to cite a personal example, I can point to our approach in interpreting the
                    story of William Conner. One of the most difficult parts of the Conner story for the modern visitor
                    to deal with is the fact that he sent away his 
                        Delaware
                     wife of eighteen years, along with their six children, when the 
                        Delaware
                     were removed in 1820, and that he remained on land 
                    he later claimed in their name. By trying to put ourselves in his place (in effect, role-playing) we
                    looked at his options. In brief, he could remain and keep his family with him. Would doing so raise
                    opprobrium in a world that held Native Americans in generally low regard, and would such a reaction
                    negatively affect his ambitions? He could go with his family (as his French trading partner did).
                    But what would that mean for him? As a forty-something man who had lived his entire life on one
                    frontier, did he consider himself too old to start a new life on another? He could stay and
                    "send his family away" (to use a phrase a future in-law employed), and thus be in
                    place to take advantage of being already established in a rapidly settling area.
            In the end, we cannot know with any certainty which of the above were the most important factors in
                    his decision, partly because Conner left no documents, like diaries or letters, to provide insight
                    into his thinking. What we do know is that he remained and within three months married an
                    eighteen-year-old woman he had previously met and expressed an attraction to. Did the thought of
                    already having a "replacement" for his family (a "trophy wife,"
                    in the view of many of our modern visitors) make his decision easier? Again, we cannot be sure, but
                    merely asking the questions, trying to assume his role, is illuminating. In a world of divorce,
                    broken families, and relocation for economic reasons, the modern person can easily relate to and
                    perhaps learn from, Conner's actions. If nothing else, the exercise helps one to understand
                    better the context both of his times and of our own.
            WM: A recent book which comes to mind is William Lee Miller's Lincoln's Virtues: An Ethical Biography. In this valuable work Miller uses a wide
                    range of contemporary sources to trace the political and philosophical development of the Great
                    Emancipator. Miller does so in ways that engage readers in the issues of Lincoln's time but
                    also provide a template for examination of those same issues as they play out in their lives.
                    Matters such as ambition and morality in politics, racism, and leadership, are all issues that we
                    struggle with in our day. In my view, Miller manages not only to shed light on Lincoln's
                    struggles, but invites readers to examine current leaders and even themselves.
            As a teacher, I have found that extensive use of primary source documents in class discussion
                    provides a means of greater engagement by students. For example, Frederick Douglass's
                    "Fourth of July Speech," or the Socialist Party Platform of 1912, or the Roosevelt
                    Corollary, closely read and discussed, can help students understand underlying issues and create a
                    basis for the application of those ideas to their lives. A very successful technique for this type
                    of discussion has been the "Socratic seminar," now used in many schools
                    nationwide. This approach requires that the leader focus the group on a central question, for
                    example, "Can a black person celebrate the Fourth of July?"  Students must use specific points from the text as a basis for
                    discussion. The product of the discussion then serves as the basis for a written reflective piece on
                    the questions raised in the document. I have found that the seminar technique, appropriately used,
                    can be very useful in increasing the understanding and application of history for a wide range of
                    students.

                        I got sent to live with Mama in 
                                Indianapolis
                            , this woman I didn't know, when I was thirteen. She wasn't a
                            hitter, so we got along well. The best part of being with her—after I decided,
                            "Well, I'm not goin' to die here"—was my baby
                            brother. I came to town on August 6, 1954, and he had been born in June of'54. So
                            he was my puppy. He was mine. I fed him and took care of him. That was the first person I
                            can remember that loved me. Annie Johnson, interview by Judith Vale Newton
                            (p. 21).
                    
                
            A compilation of forty-seven short narratives and oral testimonies (mostly by and about women), Urban Tapestry contains compelling close-ups of city dwellers. As Rabbi Sandy
                    Eisenberg Sasso grandly asserts, "They may be grounded in the unique geography and
                    personality of the Hoosier capital, but they transcend their particular locale to speak to the
                    universal human condition" (p. vii). The most poignant vignettes deal with race and the
                    immigrant experience. Central to this collaborative project are documentary photographs such as one
                    of "Mrs. Robards's" empty house. Mrs. Robards, who never abandoned her
                    neighborhood until forced into a nursing home, is the subject of Khemli Ezell's
                    "The Only White Left." So long as she lived next door, Ezell writes, 
                        I never thought about racism or ethnic identity as something to be struggled with
                     (p. 110). Returning from college to her old "high-risk" neighborhood,
                    Ebony Utley observed that her father had installed a motion-detecting floodlight on their porch. She
                    concludes, "I'm proud not to be a product of the neighborhood's
                    negativity, but a representative of its positive characteristics. And for those who misunderstand,
                    who fear, or who just don't know, it's up to me to take a piece of the hood to
                    them" (p. 76).
            Barbara Shoup recalls a 1992 Broad Ripple High School assembly held the day after a 
                        California
                     jury acquitted white policemen who had been videotaped beating Rodney King. African
                    Americans were the only group allowed to speak. Shoup writes, "White, Asian, and Hispanic
                    students, who felt equally angry and despairing about the decision, were deeply offended at being
                    denied the opportunity to show support for their black classmates and share their own
                    grief" (p. 131).
            As its mostly white cover suggests, almost everything about Urban Tapestry is
                    spare. Aesthetically, the motif works, but to fully serve Clio, the muse of history, more background
                    context would have been welcome to supplement the snippets. With its stated purpose the search for
                    the sacred, Urban Tapestry, albeit nonfiction, falls into the field of religious
                    studies. In a section entitled "The Place Where  You
                    Stand Is Holy," Lin Neville eulogizes a poet who taught her, at the Hummingbird Cafe, how
                    to bring compositions to life by reading them aloud; "Etheridge [Knight] in the Hummingbird
                    was the city to me—a human largeness, space, and freedom from small-town manners, a place
                    to breathe" (p. 72).
            Clearly most contributors love their city, once referred to pejoratively as
                    "Naptown" and also as "India-no-place." There are even tributes
                    to the Indy 500 and a state-of-the-art mall near Monument Circle. Booster Nancy N. Baxter claims,
                    "Our downtown went way down twenty years ago, but we rallied as a city and rebuilt it
                    resplendently. We don't take failure easily in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . After all, that's Miss Victory on top of the Monument, isn't
                    it?" (p. 48).

               Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great
                        Lakes. By Susan Sleeper-Smith. (Amherst: University of 
                        Massachusetts
                     Press, 2002. Pp. xv, 234. Maps, illustrations, tables, notes, index. Clothbound,
                    $45.00; paperbound, $18.95.)
            The Saint Joseph River section of northwestern Indiana and southwestern 
                        Michigan
                     forms the principal focus of the eight essays in this book which emphasizes the
                    significant role of Indian women in the history of the Midwest. The geographic coverage extends into
                    northern 
                        Illinois
                     in the opening account of Marie Rouensa, a seventeenth-century 
                        Illinois
                     woman who converted to Catholicism to marry a French trader. Attention is later
                    diverted to central Indiana in a discussion of the well-known captive Frances Slocum and the plight
                    of nineteenth-century Miami living on the Mississinewa River.
            Probably the most interesting elements of Susan Sleeper-Smith's writing are her vignettes
                    describing the careers of selected women of French and Indian heritage who played exceptionally
                    influential roles in Great Lakes fur-trading beginning in the early eighteenth century. Foremost is
                    the story of Marie Madeleine Reaume, who became a principal figure with her marriage to trader Louis
                    Chevalier and subsequent involvement in events at Fort Saint Joseph (Niles, 
                        Michigan
                    ). The family history continues with the account of their son's role at Fort
                    Saint Joseph and his trading and military connections during the American Revolution when the
                    Spanish temporarily held the 
                        Michigan
                     post in 1781. The author also cites the later career of Magdelaine LaFramboise, an
                    Odawa woman who carried on a trading enterprise in the Grand River Valley of 
                        Michigan
                     after her husband's murder, establishing an empire that extended to the upper 
                        Missouri
                     River.
            
            One thread connecting most of these essays is the idea that Indian wives of French traders, and their
                    descendants, created a special "Catholic kinship network different from the system forming
                    the basis of indigenous social organization (p. 29, e.g.). The author also explores
                    "adaptive strategies" of Indian people, particularly to resist removal in the
                    1830s. One strategy was to blend into white society. She notes that the Godfroys on the Mississinewa
                    River "paid a high price" (p. 140) for their "construction of
                    whiteness" when the Indiana court decided in 1897 that they no longer retained the
                    privileges to occupy lands that were accorded to people with tribal status. She also cites the life
                    story of Frances Howe, a descendant of the Bailly trading family of the Indiana dunes region, who
                    revised family history to justify her need to suppress recognition of her Indian heritage. The
                    Pokagon Potawatomi of southwestern 
                        Michigan
                     successfully used their Catholic faith to claim exemption from removal.
            The author's rethinking of history includes observations on the agricultural accomplishments
                    of midwestern Indian women, emphasizing the corn and maple sugar that the Potawatomi and Odawa often
                    marketed to army posts. However, she is not justified in suggesting that the ridged "garden
                    beds" of southwestern 
                        Michigan

            This new history of 
                        Ohio
                     is a thoughtful and compelling account that challenges midwestern readers to think
                    differently about the history of their state, whether they hail from 
                        Ohio
                     or not. Many state histories in the past have been political chronicles of dates,
                    battles, pioneers, and leaders, telling a story of progress. Social historian Andrew R. L. Cayton, a
                    history professor at Miami University of 
                        Ohio
                     and frequent writer about the Midwest, does not ignore pioneers or politicians, but he
                    certainly does not glorify them. He draws on a variety of sources, especially the writings of
                    Ohioans known and unknown, to provide some new perspectives on 
                        Ohio
                    's past.
            
            "Public" and "ordinary" are two words that play important roles
                    in this history. The book argues that public culture (and the public conversation that creates it)
                    is key to the state's history and identity, to its successes and failures. In a section on
                    inventors, Cayton writes, 
                        
                     
                                Ohio
                             did not nurture Mozarts and Michelangelos…. Rather, its glory lay in
                            the ordinariness of its citizens, its pride in the fact that it was typically American
                     (p. 177).
            The book tells 
                        Ohio
                    's nineteenth-century story especially well. Like other midwestern states, 
                        Ohio
                     was a place to which white and black Americans migrated from 
                        New England
                     and 
                        New York
                    , the mid-Atlantic states and the South. How these American migrants combined, fought,
                    and adjusted in the various states of the region reveals much about their histories. As the first
                    state in what was known as the Old Northwest, 
                        Ohio
                     provides a benchmark for residents of the other states that grew out of that
                    region—Indiana, 
                  Illinois, Michigan
               , and 
                        Wisconsin
                     (and part of 
                        Minnesota
                    )—seeking to understand their own histories.
            The book discusses how people who moved to early 
                        Ohio
                     came to consider themselves Ohioans despite their disparate origins and intentions, and
                    despite the many regions of the state, such as the Western Reserve, that at times seemed to have a
                    stronger identity than the state itself. To figure out how an 
                        Ohio
                     identity developed, Cayton uses accounts by and about ordinary people, such as the
                    Quakers Joseph and Sarah Gibbons, and writers such as the 
                        Ohio
                     German novelist Emil Klauprecht. Klauprecht's novel, 
                  
                            Cincinnati
                        , oder Geheimnisse Des Westens, provides Cayton with a German-American critique
                    of American 
                        Ohio
                     in the 1850s. The novel, he writes, 
                        offers Germans imagining themselves as sensual romantics whose contribution to 
                                Ohio
                             is saving native-born Americans from cold materialism and repression
                     (p. 151). He also uses the diaries of the earnest young couple who became President
                    Rutherford B. Hayes and First Lady "Lemonade Lucy" Webb Hayes to tell the story of
                    the state's reformist Yankees.
            As a student of ethnic history, this reviewer found "Alternative Ohios" to be one
                    of the strongest chapters in the book. In it Cayton uses four white immigrant groups to demonstrate
                    that ethnicity, as well as size, time of arrival, and place of settlement, played a strong role in
                    each group's very different experience in the state. The Welsh, who arrived early and
                    settled in the hills of southeastern 
                        Ohio
                    , wanted to be left alone to recreate their homeland culture in a new place. The myriad
                    German immigrant groups, an assortment of Catholic, Protestant, and nonreligious Germans, came
                    together to resist the 
                        Ohio
                     version of American culture they encountered and attempted, with some success, to
                    change it. German Jews, led by a pair of notable rabbis in 
                        Cincinnati
                    , embraced religious modernization as one path to acceptance and made the city a
                    national center for Reform Judaism.  The state's
                    Italian, Slavic, and Hungarian immigrants, who arrived later to take industrial jobs in 
                        Cleveland
                     and other northeastern 
                        Ohio
                     cities, became Ohioans even though the urgency of economic survival kept them from
                    participating fully in civic life.
            Race, class, and to a lesser extent gender are discussed throughout the book. Whites and African
                    Americans argued about who was a citizen of the state and, later, about how the state's
                    citizens would be treated. In spite of 
                        Ohio
                    's current celebration of the Underground Railroad, Cayton questions whether
                    white citizens have been willing throughout the state's history to acknowledge blacks as
                    their equals. He also discusses the firm grasp that the middle class had on the state's
                    economic and social agenda until well into the twentieth century, when labor unions became a
                    powerful collective voice for working-class people.
            Cayton describes the book as "a chronicle of tales of American life" (p. vii) that
                    are anchored in one place. 
                        
                            Ohio
                        
                     is not just a gathering of stories that happen to take place in 
                        Ohio
                    , however. The stories are carefully chosen to make a larger historical point about
                    "the transformation of a radical imperative to do good into a conservative desire to live
                    well" (p. vii). How 
                        Ohio
                    's citizens changed over two hundred years from a society with a strong
                    interest in self-improvement and social improvement to an individualistic, consumer society is the
                    larger tale told here.
            Although the book needs a map showing the cities, towns, rivers, and other landscape features
                    mentioned, it should stimulate lively discussion among students and general readers in 
                        Ohio
                     and throughout the Midwest.

                        Iowa
                    -born evangelist Billy Sunday apparently preached to one hundred million Americans in
                    thirty-nine years of revival work ending in 1935, reducing the population of hell by more than a
                    million in the process. Robert F. Martin, a history professor at the University of Northern 
                        Iowa
                    , argues that the acrobatic apostle from Ames 
                    appealed to those who shared his embrace of "the national myth of success" (p. xv)
                    in their uncertain encounter with modernity.
            Martin writes that the heartland may have been a land of opportunity for some, but for
                    Sunday's family it was a place of acute disappointment. Billy and his two older brothers
                    lost their father in the Civil War. After their mother married an abusive alcoholic, the
                    twelve-year-old Billy was sent to an orphanage. "Recurring feelings of loss and
                    loneliness" (p. 15) gave Sunday a lifelong "sense of insecurity and
                    inadequacy" while intensifying his "drive to succeed" (p. 23).
            In 1883 Sunday became a second-string outfielder on Albert Spalding's 
                        Chicago
                     White Stockings in baseball's newly organized National League. Sunday could
                    not hit, but Manager Cap Anson admired the way he "ran the bases liked a scared
                    deer" (p. 29). Sunday became a Christian at a meeting of the Pacific Garden Mission in 1886
                    and married the solidly middle-class Helen Thompson two years later. He was celebrated in the press
                    as the poster boy of the great American pastime who "never utters a cuss word, nor dallies
                    with red liquor, nor knows the taste of the weed (p. 40).
            Sunday quit baseball in 1891 at the age of twenty-eight to go into full-time religious work. Soon he
                    followed the "kerosene circuit" (p. 47) "preaching plainly" (p.
                    48), while "putting the cookies and jam on the lower shelf" (p. 53) so audiences
                    would understand his message. Sunday's showmanship built attendance and appealed to the
                    press. By the first decade of the twentieth century he had a national following; by the second, he
                    was the best-known evangelist in the English-speaking world. He dined with millionaires and became
                    one. During the twenties he was past his peak, living in semi-retirement at Winona
                    Lake, Indiana, while exhorting ever-diminishing audiences to oppose the increasing
                    secularism of their society.
            Martin claims that Sunday's "entrepreneurial evangelism" (p. 45) combined
                    the powers of prayer and publicity with "the sophisticated business practices of his
                    day" (p. 63). His "Progressive orthodoxy" (p. 101) embraced
                    women's suffrage and Prohibition in hopes of creating a more righteous nation. All this,
                    Martin argues, made Sunday very much a man of his time and a "hero of the
                    heartland" (p. 121).
            The most intriguing part of Martin's analysis is his summary of Sunday's troubled
                    childhood and lifelong allegiance to "a faith that helped him to integrate his
                    life" (p. 23). Martin's scene-setting is less satisfying. The reader is told that
                    Sunday found 
                        Chicago
                    's "Protestants, Catholics, and Jews alike worried they were failing
                    to stay abreast of the change swirling around them" (p. 31). Equally vague and
                    unsubstantiated is "the roar of the machine and cacophony of the stockyards [that]
                    threatened to drown out the voices of the disinherited" (p. 31). More perturbing to Martin
                    is Sunday's failure to challenge "the dominant economic, social, or political
                    assumptions of the day" and his inability to grasp what Martin sees as "the
                    reality of collective [and] institutional evil" (p. 139). Sunday was in the salvation
                    business  but we learn little of those moved by his message.
                    Martin dismisses many of them as "disoriented and disenfranchised" (p. 133). The
                    author acknowledges that "few religious figures have had a greater impact on American
                    popular culture" (p. xiii), but Sunday as an adult or in sustained action rarely emerges in
                    these pages. Instead, Martin simply asserts that Sunday "oversimplified the complexities of
                    human nature and of economic and social relationships" (p. 139), leaving this reader still
                    wondering how one man's life and ministry could mean so much to so many for so long.
            Tona J. Hangen traces the community created through the "golden age" of revival
                    radio (p. 2). The careers of radio pioneers Paul Rader, Aimee Semple McPherson, and Charles Fuller,
                    as Hangen sees it, helped to lift conservative Christianity from a defensive sideshow to "a
                    vital and growing subculture" (p. 157) guided by "an irrepressible evangelical
                    spirit" (p. 158). The author's primary interest is the audience that
                    "read radio" (p. 4) as part "popular entertainment" (p. 78) and
                    as a means of ameliorating rural isolation. Hangen's careful reading of Depression-era
                    letters reveals "a thread of desperation" (p. 104) by many who felt personally
                    comforted through their "radio midwife" (p. 155). For these listeners, Hangen
                    argues, "radio prevented the decline of old-fashioned religious belief" (p. 8)
                    because it "resonated with nostalgic longing for better times" (p. 11).
            Fundamentalists were among the first to appreciate radio's reach. Seventy-one religious
                    stations were on the air by 1925. McPherson praised radio as "a miraculous conveyance for
                    the message" (p. 66). By 1943, Fuller's nationally syndicated
                    "Old-Fashioned Revival Hour" was giving the Mutual Broadcasting System a quarter
                    of its operating revenue. The National Religious Broadcasters Association was formed the following
                    year to help keep "crackpots, racketeers and ranters" off the air (p. 113). The
                    Federal Council of Churches went even further, exploiting their cozy relationship with the networks
                    to limit evangelical access to the airwaves. By the time Billy Graham's "Hour of
                    Decision" debuted on ABC in 1950,1,600 fundamentalist programs aired weekly on radio, and
                    religious conservatives were well on the way to penetrating the American mainstream. The
                    "good news" was easy listening in an era of Cold War warnings.
            Hangen captures the power of the spoken word in the lives "of people who felt singled out
                    for personal attention" (p. 6). Radio made it possible to "rethink entirely what
                    church was and where worship could take place" (p. 4). Whether it was "music to
                    milk by" (p. 100) or "the guiding light of our life" (p. 1091, the first
                    quarter-century of revival radio made a difference in the world of the faithful. One listener wrote,
                    "what that radio means to us no one will ever know" (p. 101). Thanks to Hangen, we
                    get a glimpse into that world.

                         Women and the Vision of the Good City, 1871–1933. By Maureen A.

            Was 
                        Chicago
                     destined to become Carl Sandburg's "City of the Big
                    Shoulders," or might it have developed "from the hearts of women," as an
                    enterprise for human betterment? This is Maureen A. Flanagan's central question, and she
                    successfully captures the gender dynamics that provide the answer. Men wanted a profitable city
                    while women lobbied endlessly for a livable one during the years between the Great Fire and the
                    Depression. Men won, but not without a fight. Flanagan thoroughly documents the battle scars
                    incurred by activist women in the long-running conflict over whose vision would prevail. She
                    celebrates their struggle, rather than their losses, in her analysis of this turning point in 
                        Chicago
                    's destiny.
            The book begins with the Great Fire because it is the first example of women volunteers publicly
                    challenging male authority. At this critical moment in the city's rebuilding, the
                    men's Relief and Aid Society gave priority to restoring the lost property of department
                    stores, factories, and banks. They used the funds they controlled to direct business toward vendors
                    they chose, including themselves. Activist women abandoned the men's organization and
                    formed their own society to dispense money directly to men, women, and children who had been
                    displaced by the fire. Herein lay the seeds for men's and women's alternate
                    visions.
            The women's vision of the city promoted good government rooted in social justice and a
                    healthy environment for all its residents. Flanagan recognizes the class and race boundaries that
                    separated women activists of the era, but she chooses to focus instead on the similarities women
                    shared through an "ethic of solidarity" that facilitated the forging of a common
                    identity. That lens allows her to "bring women squarely into the struggle to reform
                    municipal government, to explore their ideas and interactions across social boundaries, and to
                    uncover the alternate vision of a good city that motivated them" (p. 10). She traces
                    men's and women's political priorities and actions from the decades when women
                    were disenfranchised volunteers through the years when they could vote and run for public office.
                    She finds consistent evidence of men's emphasis on profits, professionalism, and expertise,
                    and women's search for governmental responsibility and citizen participation.
            Flanagan's insistence on maintaining the story line of gender differences sometimes borders
                    on oversimplification; she provides too few examples of men who shared women's priorities,
                    or of women who maintained political alliances with men. Her keen insight into the intricacies of
                    party politics in 
                        Chicago
                    , however, more than  compensates for this tendency.
                    Flanagan's lively writing style should appeal to academic and nonacademic readers alike.

            The author of this much-needed biography of Senator Paul Douglas, Roger Biles, provides readers with
                    a solid account. It relies heavily on Douglas's autobiography, a longer book, but reaches
                    into many other sources also. However, this good biography could have been a better one. The author
                    relied totally on written sources. He did not talk to Douglas's children. So far as I can
                    tell, he did not talk with any of us who knew and worked with this Senate giant. As a result, the
                    book provides insights into the issues that captivated Douglas and gives us a sense of what happened
                    but lacks the personal insights and sparkle it would have contained if the biographer had taken the
                    simple step of interviewing a dozen people.
            The man whom Martin Luther King praised as "the greatest of all senators" comes
                    across accurately as a passionate proponent of civil rights, an opponent of "sweetheart
                    deals" between legislators and their big campaign contributors, an environmentalist before
                    that term gained wide use, and a vigorous advocate for protecting citizens from abuse by commercial
                    interests.
            Another example of Douglas's far-reaching influence is that when we sign a note today at a
                    bank or buy a car, we assume that there will be a disclosure of interest rates, but that was not a
                    requirement until Paul Douglas fought doggedly, year after year, to provide this information for
                    borrowers. As even his supporters, such as this reviewer, look once again at the Douglas record, we
                    are amazed at the many issues on which he was ahead of his time. One was campaign finance. Biles
                    notes Douglas's response to campaign practices: "Appalled at the outrageous
                    amounts of money spent [on] the 1966 elections, [Douglas] feared the consummation of an unholy
                    marriage between influence-peddling representatives of big business and morally lax
                    politicians" (p. 201).
            Prior to his unsuccessful attempt to secure a fourth term in the Senate, the Vietnam War emerged as a
                    major issue. Douglas had abandoned his 
                        Quaker
                     pacifism to fight in World War 11, in which he was badly wounded. He feared that
                    failure to respond to the Communist insurgency in Vietnam would be to repeat the mistake made in
                    appeasing Hitler. His prowar stance, plus the tragic murder of his opponent's daughter,
                    combined to defeat this man who had brought  so much to the
                    nation. Reading this book reminds us of those huge contributions.

               The Wild Frontier: Atrocities During the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to
                        Wounded Knee. By William M. Osborn. (
                        New York
                    : Random House, 2000. Pp. xv, 363. Appendices, notes, bibliography, index.
                    $25.95.)
            
               The Wild Frontier presents two themes that affected the history of Indian-white
                    relations across the United States. The first is essentially cultural. Opening chapters deal with
                    traditional aspects of tribal life—including war tactics, territorial-defense techniques,
                    and cultural proclivities, both positive and negative (such as a lust for cruelty during times of
                    distress). According to William M. Osborn's analysis, tribal governments were somewhat
                    desultory but suitably democratic. Traditional cultures featured a commitment to family life that
                    included a tendency to indulge the children and celebrate the elders. Yet families sometimes killed
                    infants and abandoned elders along the trails. Seemingly callous aspects of tribal behavior surfaced
                    mainly during confrontations with immigrants who displayed no regard for tribal circumstances and
                    sensibilities. Ordinarily, tribal members tempered hardship with humor and displayed respect for
                    nature. The most obvious deficiency in Osborn's cultural analysis is a failure to describe
                    the importance of spirituality and religious practices.
            Osborn's second theme is his detailed description of atrocities perpetrated by tribal groups
                    and non-Indians, covered in five chapters (pp. 93-245), from precolonial times to the end of the
                    nineteenth century. Final chapters explain that the success of federal troops in fighting Indians,
                    benefits written into treaties, and regulations included in federal statutes settled behavior on
                    both sides of the racial confrontation. The text closes with a superficial description of federal
                    policy history and the question of "Where We Are and Where We may Go," which must
                    be answered by the tribes and not by external forces of culture and government.
            Osborn is an attorney who relied almost entirely on fewer than ninety books and no original
                    research—the strategy of a lawyer instead of a professional historian. He used snippets
                    of information published by many authors, amateurs as well as professionals, without regard for
                    variation in the reliability of their books. Nevertheless, his text contains a potpourri of data and
                    description that provides a legitimate portrayal of cultural aspects in the history of Indian-white
                    relations.
            
            Osborn's text addresses Indian-white affairs across the United States, and it should
                    interest general readers in every state because the themes apply to all tribal environments from
                    coast to coast. Scholars who have read most of the sources listed in the bibliography and are
                    capable of critiquing the information they contain should see this as a helpful reference work.
                    Librarians who serve the interests of general readers or scholars should regard The
                        Wild Frontier as an essential addition to collections that feature ethnic history.

                    C. Wallace. (

                    $29.95.)
            A major thrust of recent scholarship on Thomas Jefferson is that he was a man with inconsistent,
                    paradoxical, and even hypocritical beliefs. Consider, for example, Joseph J. Ellis's
                    award-winning character study, which describes Jefferson as an American Sphinx
                    (1997). Now historical anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace joins the chorus by arguing that
                    Jefferson's "contradictions," which "have been most conspicuous
                    in his handling of the issue of slavery and in his disregard of constitutional restrictions on
                    executive power," manifest themselves also "in his conduct of Indian
                    affairs" (p. 16). Jefferson, after all, maintained a lifelong interest in Native American
                    culture and tendered expressions of benevolence—and even admiration—toward
                    Indians. Yet his vision for the future left little room for them. As Wallace notes, in 1801 he
                    shared with James 
                        Monroe
                     his hope that someday all of North America would be inhabited by "a people
                    speaking the same language, governed in similar forms, and by similar laws" (p. 17).
            Despite some heavy breathing that connects "'ethnic cleansing"'
                    (p. 20) and "cultural genocide" (p. 276) to Jefferson's Indian policy,
                    Wallace deserves credit for providing a fairly evenhanded explanation of its origins and rationale.
                    Although, like many of the leading members of his generation, Jefferson speculated in western lands,
                    Wallace attributes his posture toward Indians to motives other than self-interest. The War for
                    Independence taught the young statesman that Indians and their warriors could undermine the
                    republic, a view that seemed to spark in him not only fear but also fascination. Wallace's
                    account of the decade following the Revolution provides an impressive analysis of
                    Jefferson's explorations into Native American language, technology, history, and culture.
                    Beginning in the 1790s, however, Jefferson's concerns became less academic and more
                    geopolitical. The British, French, and Spanish threatened America's frontiers, and  Indians—all too aware of the burgeoning U.S.
                    population's hunger for land—seemed likely to aid them. For Jefferson, the
                    solution was to solidify the republic's territorial claims through diplomacy and the
                    relocation and concentration of Indians, whose hunting would eventually diminish wildlife and force
                    a choice between either exchanging their lands for the "goods and education needed for
                    survival as European-style agriculturists and citizens of the republic" (p. 225) or
                    resettling farther west. Either way, according to Wallace, Jefferson entertained no doubt
                    "that Indian people must ultimately adopt the white man's ways in order to
                    survive" (p. 226). If, as Wallace concludes, "in building a nation, the challenge
                    is not to enforce uniformity but to orchestrate diversity" (p. 3381, then Jefferson failed
                    as a nation-builder.
            Because Wallace displays more interest in writing about history than about historians, some readers
                    may not recognize that a few facets of his argument relate to the work of other scholars. Drew R.
                    McCoy, for example, first pointed out (The Elusive Republic: Political Economy in
                        Jeffersonian America [1980]) that Jeffersonians believed that the preservation of
                    America's republican experiment hinged on its citizens' perpetual
                    self-reliance—a virtue derived from an agrarianism that, given the rapid multiplication
                    of the U.S. population, required the conversion of Native American hunting lands into farms. As a
                    result, Jeffersonians believed that the only way to reconcile the interests of Indians and whites
                    was to encourage Indians to take up the plow and assimilate into white society—as Bernard
                    Sheehan has ably demonstrated (Seeds of Extinction: Jeffersonian Philanthropy and the
                        American Indian [1973]). On these subjects the works of McCoy and Sheehan continue to
                    provide the most sophisticated and satisfying accounts. On the broader topic of Jefferson's
                    complicity in the Indians' "tragic fate," Wallace's new study
                    constitutes a fresh and provocative starting point.

            Appalachia has long mystified America. Despite efforts to refute it, the ubiquitous description of
                    the region as a "strange land" inhabited by "peculiar people,"
                    first coined by Will Harney in 1873, has retained a prominent place in the minds of many Americans,
                    as witnessed by Robert Schenken's 1992 Pulitzer prize-winning play, The 
                            Kentucky
                         Cycle. This should not come as a surprise, however, as scholars continue to
                    debate the riddles posed by the southern mountains.  Some, such
                    as Henry Shapiro and Allen Batteau, see the region as the product, the creation,
                    of the imaginations of urban "flatlanders." Others, including Altina Waller and
                    Ron Eller, focus on those who manipulated the people and resources of the region for their own gain
                    and who thus precipitated the problems, such as poverty and illiteracy, that many see as endemic and
                    systemic among the people of Appalachia. A History of Appalachia attempts to
                    synthesize and interpret this complex body of Appalachian scholarship for the casual reader and
                    offers the uninitiated a glimpse into the "mysteries" of the region.
            Significantly more than the product of fertile imaginations, Drake's Appalachia is a
                    distinct geographic entity, stretching from southern 
                        New York
                     to northern 
                        Alabama
                    , inhabited by people who adhere to a "yeomanesque mentality" that
                    treats the land as a resource for family sustenance rather than a marketable commodity. This
                    culture, moreover, values simplicity and self-reliance and precludes the accumulation of wealth and
                    the desire for material comfort. Part of the first white settlers' European heritage, this
                    attitude has survived and shaped Appalachian responses to war, industrialization, and the
                    "postmodern" world. Notwithstanding its limitations, Drake contends that this
                    lifestyle is a realistic option for "those unwilling or unable to join the
                    mainstream's affluence" (p. 246). Drake certainly believes that his readers will,
                    and should, see this "yeoman" existence as positively as he does, but, ironically,
                    this assertion reinforces that same "strange and peculiar" stereotype that
                    Appalachian scholars have refuted for decades.
            Following a brief discussion of the region's original inhabitants, Drake quickly moves to
                    the focus of his study, the influx of "cottagers" from peripheral regions of
                    Britain and Germany. Driven from their homes by economic, religious, and political difficulties in
                    the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and lured by the promise of readily available
                    land, these displaced migrants settled in the newly opened lands of Appalachia. Already different
                    from the older tidewater colonists, this latter wave of "pioneer-settlers" first
                    occupied the fertile fringe areas of the mountains and its larger interior valleys. Here they
                    established their yeoman society amid the pressures from hostile Native Americans still in the
                    region on one hand and a land-speculating, lowland-based, market-oriented elite on the other. In
                    short, Drake's migration story, in terms of both culture and geography, is one from a
                    European to an American periphery.
            Precipitated by this "distance" was a "backwoods" or
                    "Cohee" society. Jealous of challenges to their personal autonomy and property,
                    these Cohees led the 
                        North Carolina
                     Regulators of the late eighteenth century, the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion in western
                    Pennsylvania, and by the middle of the nineteenth century, through the efforts of individuals such
                    as John G. Fee and institutions including the Presbyterian Church, offered a southern alternative to
                    the capitalist,  slaveholding South. In the discussion of the
                    antebellum period, however, Drake illustrates the problems inherent in trying to label the region,
                    for tucked in-between the ridges and mountains were areas, such as the Shenandoah and 
                        Tennessee
                     valleys, where slavery was firmly entrenched. Moreover, a number of elite mountain
                    families not only owned bondsmen, but had family, business, and strong political connections with
                    lowland masters.
            It was not until the post-Civil War years that the "mysteries" of
                    Appalachia—those same mysteries that puzzle modern Americans—took shape.
                    During this period urban, county-seat elites, local color writers, missionaries, and business
                    promoters created the image of Appalachian residents as "branchwater"
                    mountaineers—an image designed to satisfy their political, social, and economic agendas.
                    While the color writers sought unique stories for their urban audience and missionaries used the
                    image of the isolated mountaineer to garner financial support for their cause, the business sector
                    most fully exploited the stereotype. By depicting mountaineers as "cultureless,"
                    coal and timber operators rationalized their assault on the region by claiming that industry brought
                    civilization to the hills. Though reflecting only a minority of the region's population,
                    this picture fascinated Americans and provided them with what is now the prevailing image of all
                    Appalachia.
            Fully cognizant of the devastating impact of extractive industry on the region, Drake traces the
                    development of a "coal town culture" in the company towns that dotted Appalachia
                    by the early twentieth century. Markedly different from the prevailing yeoman lifestyle, this new
                    culture resulted from the concomitant development of Appalachian "corporate
                    feudalism" and mountain proletarianism. Nevertheless, the yeoman mind survived and resisted
                    movements such as Populism and the War on Poverty that sought to employ an activist government in
                    combating the industrial plutocracy.
            Modern, post-World War II Appalachia presented even more dilemmas. As the coal industry mechanized,
                    for example, well-paying but relatively fewer jobs remained. This, coupled with pro-business federal
                    policies and tax breaks for energy conglomerates, resulted in massive unemployment and the
                    reassertion of corporate control. As jobless Appalachians fled to northern cities in search of work,
                    the federal government responded to the crisis by funneling finds through organizations such as the
                    Appalachian Regional Commission into "growth centers." Unfortunately, most of
                    these centers were those mountain areas that already were the most developed. Due to this migration,
                    modern Appalachia is demographically larger. Installations such as the atomic facility at Oak Ridge, 
                        Tennessee
                    , have made it technologically advanced. Yet it is, in Drake's interpretation,
                    still a region that desperately hangs onto its traditions.
            Though this study moves too quickly, lacks the depth needed to address the issues fully, and itself
                    creates a "peculiar, yeoman"  image, it does
                    introduce readers unfamiliar with the region to the conundrum that is Appalachia. Just as important,
                    it will serve as a clarion call for students of the subject to begin thinking of the mountain region
                    as a whole rather than just its component parts.

            This is a fine and provocative survey of the life and legacy of Shubal Stearns, the Separate Baptist
                    pastor, evangelist, and frontier churchman. Converted in the first Great Awakening, Stearns went
                    south and in 1775, with the help of his wife Sarah as well as her sister Martha and brother-in-law
                    Daniel Marshall, founded the Sandy Creek Baptist Church in 
                        North Carolina
                    , the first such congregation in the region. His influence was considerable, shaping the
                    theology and practice of early Baptists in the South.
            The author, Elder John Sparks, is both a researcher and a minister of the United Baptists, a Baptist
                    subdenomination that retains elements of Stearns's influence. Sparks utilizes important
                    primary and secondary sources in his research and does not hesitate to challenge traditional
                    historiography regarding Stearns's work. Throughout the book, Sparks cites earlier
                    historians who, in his view, failed to deal with "unpleasant facts" (p. 84). He
                    has a point. Certain denominationally loyal historians often wrote in hagiographical ways about
                    characters such as Stearns. Sparks details controversies galore, especially power struggles in the
                    early churches and associations.
            Occasionally, Sparks's zeal prompts him to make excessive generalizations, such as his
                    assertion that the Southern Baptist Convention, "with its historians" holds
                    "that the entire Separatist movement was some sort of aberration…" (p.
                    194). This undocumented claim is not true. At least, the author needs to document his assertion and
                    identify which Southern Baptist Convention he is discussing (fundamentalist, moderate, old line, new
                    line).
            Stearns was a complex figure, given to the "enthusiasms" that characterized the
                    pro-Awakening New Light or Separatist churches. His frontier world was a rough-and-tumble
                    environment where faith, hope, and love blossomed amid coarse lifestyles, mixed motives, rampant
                    gossip, and incessant backbiting. (And those were just the Baptists!) Sparks devotes considerable
                    space to Stearns's preaching  style and its place in
                    the "sing-song" cadence of the "holy whine" of the Appalachian
                    pulpits. A chapter on the infamous Raccoon John Smith, the Restorationist preacher, is fascinating,
                    but one wonders if it really fits this particular subject matter.
            Sparks offers insights into the development of other Baptist subgroups, especially the United
                    Baptists. He documents the impact of Stearns's ideas as evidenced in various Appalachian
                    Baptist communions. The book offers insights into groups that have often been overlooked or
                    undermined in Baptist studies. It compels us to examine Stearns's impact on Baptist life
                    and the nature of Baptist identity in contemporary churches and denominations.

               Saving the Heartland: Catholic Missionaries in Rural America, 1920-1960. By
                    Jeffrey D. Marlett. (

            "The Catholic rural life movement, more than any other group within the American Catholic
                    Church, combined its faith with everyday life" (p. 3). This opening line contains the first
                    of many superlatives that Jeffrey D. Marlett uses to describe Catholic missionaries in rural
                    America. Considering that the marriage of Catholicism and American culture has been the organizing
                    principle for most studies in U.S. Catholic history, Marlett makes another bold claim by asserting
                    that the National Catholic Rural Life Conference (NCRLC) "combined
                    'American' and 'Catholic' in a way that few other Catholic
                    organizations managed before John F. Kennedy's election in 1960" (p. 16). Although
                    Marlett is not always entirely convincing on these points, his eloquent and erudite narrative
                    inclines the reader to forgive his tendency toward overstatement, or at least to acknowledge that it
                    is done in service to the book's main achievement: providing a necessary corrective to a
                    literature that largely equates American Catholicism with the urban (or, later, suburban) ethnic
                    experience in northeastern parishes.
            The antiurban theology of the Catholic agrarians derived from their perception of the
                    "Catholic rural problem," which emerged from the census data of 1910. Falling
                    urban birthrates, rising rural ones, and the overwhelming concentration (80 percent) of Catholics in
                    cities produced concern that, unless the trend were reversed, the church would breed itself out of
                    existence by the 1960s. The NCRLC, organized by priest and sociologist Edwin O'Hara in 
                        St. Louis
                     in 1923, represented one attempt to address this crisis. Others included foundations
                    such as Maryfarm, a Catholic Worker farm begun in Pennsylvania in 1936,  and Family Acres, a community established by graduate students at Notre
                    Dame in 1947. Marlett places these attempts to transplant urban Catholics to the spiritually and
                    physically fertile countryside within the history of American Catholic colonization projects, such
                    as Archbishop John Ireland's Irish Catholic Colonization Association of the late nineteenth
                    century.
            Catholic agrarianism also promoted evangelization among Catholics already living in rural areas. As
                    with attempts at colonization, the lofty goals of the agrarians were habitually left unrealized,
                    mostly because of inability to translate an idealized vision to the harsh reality of rural life.
                    Missionaries made their most significant contribution by cultivating a sense of Catholic identity
                    among rural Catholics. Until the work of agrarians accentuated their religious distinctiveness,
                    rural Catholics blended in so well that Marlett describes them as having been "part of the
                    scenery."
            The great success story of the Catholic rural life movement involved the "motor
                    missions" that canvassed the American countryside from 1930 until the mid-1950s.
                    Specifically targeting non-Catholics, the priests who manned these "trailer
                    chapels" proclaimed the Catholic truth on the streets of small towns in rural parts of
                    twenty-eight states. Calling the motor missions "the quintessentially American expression
                    of Catholicism" (p. 134), Marlett argues that, unlike their urban counterparts, these
                    missionaries seamlessly blended the pursuit of Catholicity (by preaching
                    "undiluted" Catholicism) with the search for catholicity (by embracing
                    non-Catholics).
            Representing a "doomed assault against modernity," the Catholic rural life movement
                    was largely defunct by the mid-1950s. But Marlett argues that aspects of Catholic agrarianism
                    resurfaced in different manifestations in the 1960s: in environmental spirituality and in the
                    liturgical changes that followed the Second Vatican Council. (Both the vernacular mass and altars
                    facing the people had been common in rural areas since the 1930s). Conceding that his subjects never
                    achieved the success they sought, Marlett argues they nevertheless contributed to "the
                    dynamism and richness of American Catholicism" (p. 172). This claim is undoubtedly true,
                    and Marlett has provided an engaging and worthwhile overview of an understudied subject.

               Horse Opera: The Strange History of the 1930s Singing Cowboy. By Peter
                    Stanfield. (

            Those who enjoy the singing cowboy image will find much information in this book to support their
                    enjoyment and possibly  stimulate their memories of earlier
                    days. Peter Stanfield, a senior lecturer in media arts at the Southhampton Institute in England, has
                    written extensively about Hollywood and westerns. In his introduction he expresses his belief that
                    the "horse opera" was made for the "economically
                    disenfranchised" rural and urban working-class families of the Great Depression, and states
                    that the singing cowboy was "one of the most important cultural figures" of the
                    Depression years. He supports his theories throughout the text with historical, sociological,
                    literary, folkloristic, and cinematic evidence.
            Stanfield opens with a discussion of the cowboy and the singing cowboy images as depicted in dime
                    novels and early works of western fiction, such as Owen Wister's The
                    Virginian, as well as in the romantic images created by Theodore Roosevelt and Frederick
                    Remington. He brings in, as well, other literary works in which the singing cowboy is mentioned.
                    (Oddly enough, at no time does he mention the 1932 
                        Broadway
                     play, Green Grow the Lilacs, by Lynn Riggs, in which cowboy songs
                    sung by Tex Ritter were prominently featured. This play, titled after the popular song of the early
                    trail drive days, had much to do with the cowboy image in the East in the early 1930s and was the
                    foundation for Ritter's career.) In the second chapter Stanfield explains that the early
                    silent screen cowboys were not romantic or glamorous figures; they were not the Gary Cooper type as
                    later seen in High Noon. Those silent movies were filmed in the East by people who
                    knew little about the West and how cowboys looked, dressed, and behaved; when the industry moved
                    westward, the image changed. Stanfield also sees in some of those early westerns evidence of a
                    concern for depicting the "class struggle." While he mentions a number of films
                    and stars of the period, he misses the opportunity to point out that the singing
                    cowboy—as exemplified in a quartet appearing in the 1925 silent film Tumbleweeds, starring William S. Hart—was portrayed even before talking films
                    were introduced!
            Stanfield devotes his third chapter to a discussion of cowboy songs and singers. printed song texts
                    were popularized and romanticized by John A. Lomax in his 1910 edition of Cowboy Songs
                        and Other Frontier Ballads, which became popular with working cowboys in the West. N.
                    Howard "Jack" Thorp was the first collector of cowboy songs, and sheet music and
                    song folios became more abundant as westerns and singers featured on the radio and on records grew
                    in popularity. Left unmentioned is the impact of Mexican border radio stations, although they had
                    numerous cowboy singers such as Jules Verne Allen in the 1930s and enjoyed a broad listening
                    audience across the United States.
            The genre of the singing cowboy western grew out of the popularity of Gene Autry, but Ken Maynard is
                    generally considered to have been the first singing cowboy. Unfortunately, Maynard's
                    singing did not capture the imagination of the female audience. Other cowboy actors such as Bob
                    Steele failed as singers. John Wayne had to have his  voice
                    dubbed for his songs in his "Singing Sandy" series. In 1936, Bing Crosby was
                    featured in Rhythm on the Range, and while a western song hit came from the movie,
                    Crosby did not look comfortable in the saddle. It took Autry, with both a popular voice and the
                    credible look of a Westerner, to sell the public on the singing cowboy movie. Roy Rogers, Tex
                    Ritter, Jimmy Wakely, Rex Allen, and others followed, and Stanfield discusses the popularity of the
                    series that were developed around each star.
            Most nations have a mythical hero, and the American cowboy, whether a real working cowboy or his
                    romanticized fictional counterpart, is our mythical hero; this book gives credit to the 1930s
                    singing cowboys for playing a strong role in perpetuating that heroic image.

            Two recent histories of African Americans who became mayors of large cities immediately bring home
                    the disparity between expectations and realities. In Carl B. Stokes and the Rise of
                        Black Political Power, Leonard N. Moore portrays a man who sought his city's
                    highest office to address the myriad inequalities African Americans experienced. His term in office,
                    however, fell short of the mark because of economic reality, white hostility, and even opposition
                    from some of his core constituency. This gap between expectations and reality is evident in the
                    experiences of other black mayors: Maynard Jackson, Coleman Young, Richard Hatcher. Their stories
                    and others are covered in a volume edited by David R. Colburn and Jeffrey S. Adler, African-American Mayors: Race, Politics, and the American City.
            
            Both of these books make significant contributions to the study of black politics in U.S. cities.
                    However, their concentration on white and black sometimes leaves out or downplays other salient
                    factors that affect urban governance. The most successful aspect of these works is their portrayal
                    of the strategies that led to these men's attainment of the city's highest office.
                    The governing part is weaker. The stunning economic transformations of the latter half of the
                    twentieth century made any mayor's task unenviable, particularly in the Midwest and
                    Northeast. The migration of industries cost cities jobs and revenue. Businesses and residents turned
                    to greener pastures in suburbs, the Sunbelt, or beyond. This significant movement had already begun
                    when Carl Stokes and Richard Hatcher won the mayors' offices in 
                    
                        Cleveland
                     and Gary in 1967. Federal policy facilitated the changes and did little to ameliorate
                    the damage to central cities. The African Americans who sought opportunity in the North after World
                    War II were not able to reap the same benefits as previous groups of immigrants. They came when the
                    opportunities for decently paid, unskilled labor had dried up. Economics as well as discriminatory
                    housing policy lee the black poor as an increasing portion of central city populations.
            In the meantime, as revenues shrank, the mayor, whether white or black, had to cope with vociferous
                    demands for services. Crime rose, unemployment rose, and the quality of the schools declined.
                    Ironically, African Americans became mayors at a time when few resources were available. Yet, their
                    core constituency looked to them for greater opportunity; inevitably, there was disappointment. It
                    is clear from these volumes that black mayors succeeded in two basic areas: they increased the
                    nonwhite percentage of municipal workers, and they strengthened minority businesses by channeling
                    contracts in their direction. This changed the nature of municipal operations both substantively and
                    symbolically. Yet many African Americans in those cities were unaffected and remained poor.
            In any city, organizational and political reality stems from the nature of municipal institutions
                    (e.g., a strong or a weak mayor, a city manager, partisan or non-partisan elections) and relations
                    with the state government. These studies fail to explicate these fadors, which critically affect the
                    challenges mayors face. Arnold Hirsch's portrait of Harold Washington in African-American Mayors—which deals with the 
                        Chicago
                     machine and its legacy—is the sole exception. As with changing economics and
                    demographics, structure helps to set the parameters for governance.
            Although there continues to be a chasm separating whites and blacks in metropolitan areas, color is
                    not the only variable that affects what mayors can and cannot do. Ironically, even in booming cities
                    such as 
                        Chicago
                     or 
                        Atlanta
                     in the 1990s, benefits do not inevitably trickle downward. Most cities described in
                    these volumes have not boomed. But it is important to remember that a variety of factors have
                    affected the performance of their mayors. Gary elected Richard Hatcher in 1967. He served twenty
                    years and saw Gary's population drop, poverty rise, businesses flee, and, most of all, the
                    American steel industry implode. He had some victories but more defeats. There was white hostility,
                    there was his personality and militant predilection, but most of all there were economic trends that
                    he was unable to alter. No other mayor could have altered them.
            Stokes's career in 
                        Cleveland
                     showed the difficulty of assuming power as an outsider. Stokes erred but in an
                    environment of considerable racial tension and strident police hostility. Ronald Bayor's
                    work on 
                        Atlanta
                    's black mayors depicts greater overall cooperation, but he sees it as
                    cooptation. Maynard Jackson did reach accommodation with 
                        Atlanta
                    's very potent business community, but he also achieved  concessions valuable to his nonwhite supporters. Bayor fails to draw an
                    adequate distinction between Jackson and his successor, Andrew Young, in terms of both intent and
                    deed. Young acceded to corporate wishes without a quid pro quo.
            In addressing the career of Coleman Young in the Colburn and Archer book, Heather Ann Thompson fails
                    to realize the significance of the bloody 1967 
                        Detroit
                     riot that accelerated white flight and augmented racial hostility. Young's
                    strong speech added to polarization, but the crushing blow to the Motor City came from the very
                    automobile industry that created its rise. The industry experienced significant losses after the
                    1973 oil embargo. Its jobs and those in related industries vanished, leaving a very poor large city
                    in their wake. Several white men helped Young significantly in his attempt to rebuild or hold
                    constant his domain. Henry Ford, II, 
                        Michigan
                    's moderate Republican governor William Milliken, and President Jimmy Carter
                    all befriended Young and did what they could. Young continued to be extremely popular with many
                    nonwhite 
                        Detroit
                     residents. He spoke their language; he was their symbol. He was neither responsible for
                    the fall of 
                        Detroit
                     nor could he save it. There was not enough help from presidents other than Carter and
                    the global economic restructuring eliminated much of the city's raison
                    d'êCtre.
            The many readers of these books will learn a great deal about the advent of black municipal
                    governance. Yet the causes of central city dilemmas (or successes) are rooted in economics, federal
                    policies, and organizational forms. The authors here provide a portion of the picture, some more
                    completely than others. They begin to capture a story that is not just black and white. Addition of
                    other salient details would have enhanced the complexity of the history and the multidimensionality
                    of causes and effects.

                        Editor: Indiana Magazine of History
                        
                        It was with a great deal of interest that I read in the March 2003 Indiana Magazine of History the roundtable on Indiana University during
                                    the 1960s. Having previously read Mary Ann Wynkoop's Dissent
                                        in the Heartland, I found it to be a very informative piece. However, I
                                    must also admit that both the book and the roundtable were something of a
                                    disappointment, not for the content of their discussion but rather for what they
                                    left out. While it is the easiest critique in the arsenal of critics to lament the
                                    books that authors opt not to write, at times it is an appropriate tool, especially
                                    when it can serve as a call for further scholarly inquiry. In the case of the
                                    1960s' student movement discussed by Wynkoop and the roundtable such
                                    scholarship needs to consider not the Left, but rather two other groups of students
                                    (and faculty and administrators) on college campuses who also experienced the 1960s
                                    and 1970s: Groups on the Right, in order to provide a more balanced view of campus
                                    conditions; as well as the vast majority of students who belonged to neither left-
                                    nor right-wing groups, but at different times may have agreed with both. These two
                                    understudied groups present historians with a vast field of potential scholarship if
                                    they are willing to look.
                        To her credit, Wynkoop at times touches on both of these groups in Dissent in the Heartland. In doing so, she illustrates clearly why places
                                    like Indiana University hold such promise for just this sort of historical inquiry.
                                    On the Right, Indiana University produced several notable, national leaders. Take,
                                    for example, Tom 
                                        Houston
                                    , famous for his role in crafting the proposed Nixon
                                    administration's 
                                        Houston
                                     Plan for surveillance of political enemies. Though he is relegated to
                                    footnote status in most histories of the period, if one were considering campus
                                    politics, one might ask why 
                                        Houston
                                     came up with the plan he did. Was it something based on his experiences
                                    with the Left at IU? This would then lead to a richer understanding not only of
                                    student movements but also of the administration he served. Another example is R.
                                    Emmett Tyrrell, the founder and editor of the American Spectator,
                                    a widely circulated conservative journal, who also has roots at IU. The Spectator got its start on the courthouse square in downtown 
                                        Bloomington
                                    , within sight and earshot of many of the demonstrations that Wynkoop
                                    discusses. Again, an historian looking at the Right on campus could investigate the
                                    hows and whys of the Spectator's origin, as well as
                                    whether Tyrrell drew inspiration from William F. Buckley's National Review and the Buckley-founded Young Americans for Freedom (YAF).
                                    Indeed YAF, the Right's answer in many ways for the widely studied SDS of
                                    the Left, would also prove a useful track for scholars, for as late as the mid-1990s
                                    IU still had an active YAF chapter. Why is it that YAF remained while SDS faded from
                                    view? Another possible IU example is Robert F. Turner, who goes unmentioned in
                                    Wynkoop's book, yet headed at both the campus  and state levels the very active Student Committee for
                                    Victory in Vietnam, which boasted a membership greater than that of SDS in 
                                        Bloomington
                                    .
                        These are but thee examples of many more conservative activists IU produced during
                                    the 1960s and 1970s who have gone on to be involved in politics and business after
                                    they left 
                                        Bloomington
                                    . And as interesting as looking at the neglected Right will be, perhaps
                                    the group that deserves to be considered even more is the vast majority of students
                                    who were never (or rarely) active in any of the Left or Right's protests.
                                    Who were they? Why did they opt not to join either SDS or YAF? Why did they support
                                    certain issues but not others? To what degree did groups on the Left (or the Right)
                                    co-opt issues that most students agreed on, such as visitation hours for the
                                    opposite sex? To what degree, at the very least in Indiana, does such an
                                    investigation support the idea that Hoosiers prefer evolutionary to revolutionary
                                    changes, as expressed in James 
                                        Madison
                                    's The Indiana Way? Was this model, for all
                                    its lacking in glamour of protest, actually the way that most students experienced
                                    the 1960s? And if so, why does it remain so neglected?
                        Hopefully, scholars will pick up on these proposed threads of study. By doing so,
                                    they will help all of us better to understand the Left that Wynkoop discusses in her
                                    book, while at the same time breaking new ground and considering new issues in
                                    relation to student movements and campus politics from the era. After nearly forty
                                    years, surely it is time to consider the other facets of the 1960s. Dissent in the Heartland is a good first step. Let us hope it is not the

                        I want to thank Jason S. Lantzer for his thoughtful comments. I echo his call for
                                    further scholarly inquiry that reflects his concerns about conservative and
                                    apolitical students at Indiana University (and elsewhere) during the 1960s. And
                                    he's right, that wasn't the book I set out to write.
                        When I first got the idea to write this book during the 1980s (yes, it has been a
                                    long time), several books had appeared that presented student activism in the 1960s
                                    as a bicoastal phenomenon. There were also some accounts written by former activists
                                    who told their own stories from positions of leadership within various student
                                    groups. As someone who was somewhat involved in a variety of student groups and as a
                                    midwesterner, I wanted to discuss sixties history  in a way that emphasized the breadth of movements for social change, especially
                                    in the heartland. When I first suggested my idea of writing about Indiana University
                                    in the 1960s, several members of the faculty and staff sort of laughed, remarking
                                    that it would be a short book because nothing much happened in 
                                        Bloomington
                                    . Of course, that only piqued my curiosity. Fortunately I had support
                                    from my advisor, David Thelen, and later from James 
                                        Madison
                                    , and the rest as they say is history.
                        The reason I recount the history to this history is that when I began thinking about
                                    this topic I saw a lot of students who, as in the 1960s, seemed to think that
                                    actively promoting social change was far removed from their agendas. Conservative
                                    and apolitical students tried to marginalize activists on midwestern campuses. My
                                    idea was to make a connection with the past, demonstrating that there was a
                                    progressive tradition on campuses generally thought of as conservative—as
                                    IU certainly was. However, I do think that one of the legacies of the New Left has
                                    been to create a sense that most students were for civil rights, against the war,
                                    and part of the counterculture. So, it seems to me, it is a healthy balance to look
                                    now at conservative and apolitical students in a more direct way. Gregory L.
                                    Schneider has done that in Cadres for Conservatism: Young Americans for
                                        Freedom and the Rise of the Contemporary Right (

                                    , 1999) and he does discuss the roles of Tom

                                     and R. Emmett Tyrell in some detail. More recently, Rusty L. Monhollon
                                    pays attention to conservative voices in This Is America? The Sixties
                                        in Lawrence, 
                                            Kansas

                                    , 2002). I feel quite certain that more studies of the sixties will
                                    emerge that follow Jason Lantzer's suggestions and will provide greater
                                    contextual backgrounds for the student movement than ones like mine supply. But
                                    then, that's the beauty of writing history— there's
                                    always more work to do.
