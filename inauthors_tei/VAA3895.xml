          <head>JOSEPHINE CARROLL</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">F</hi>OR the first time since she had come to the Northwest country,
            Josephine Carroll felt lonely. It was a strange feeling, under the circumstances, and
            unexplainable. Jack was there--in that very room--with his idle hands clasped behind his
            head, his feet upon the window sill, his gaze upon the near hills, seeing visions. She
            had thought that when the old, close companionship, a year broken, should be renewed,
            she could never be lonely again. It was the day that made her restless, or the hills,
            perhaps. More practical than Jack, she saw in those huge, broken masses of gloomy,
            gumbo-stained hills, piled high up into the cloudy dampness, only an unaccountable freak
            of that age of unaccountabilities when the waters receded from the land; but more
            sensitive, she was the more depressed by their overshadowing nearness. And the <pb
              n="12" id="VAA3895-009"/>day--it was far too warm for February, and damp and close and
            still. There had been no snow for days, and yet the dead, winter-bunched grass on the
            steep slopes and in the wide valley of the river looked heavy and sodden because of the
            wetness in the air. Even the gaunt, bared branches of the small cottonwoods, and the
            rusty brown of the cedars that followed the course of the ice-bound river and merged
            into the forest of loftier elms and ancient, gigantic cottonwoods of LaDue&apos;s
            Island, contributed their just quota to the general gloom. The air was so still and
            light that the sound of each echoed blow of the axe in the hands of the island
            woodchopper came rhythmically to the ears of the homesteaders.</p>
          <p>Josephine sighed, and then, to cover the sound of it, yawned slightly, and stooped to
            smooth the ruffled fur of the big gray wolfskin rug that lay on the floor by the fire.
            It was a strong hand that stroked the stiff bristles into submissive order, though
            finely formed and unaccustomed to many things that they now found to do. Josephine
            herself was strong with a fine strength that showed itself in supple, assured movement,
            and in the clear, steadfast eyes that had a trick of looking at one sometimes so calmly
            and un- <pb n="13" id="VAA3895-010"/>questioningly, and yet so straightforwardly, that
            the effect was strangely disconcerting if one&apos;s thought or motive were not
            altogether honest. They were brown with deeps in them, yet were not all of one color,
            but were made up of varying shades of soft browns that made them beautiful. Her hair was
            yellow--very bright hair it was, too, when the sun shone on it. She herself called it
            red, and she wore it piled high upon her head--a proud head, with lifted chin.
            The lifted chin gave one an erroneous impression of height which Josephine secretly
            coveted. She was not tall. On the contrary, she was really below the medium; but she
            looked tall because of the lifted chin and the high coils of shining hair. Jack could
            have told, had he so willed, something of her passion for height which was not a late
            and passing fancy, by any means, but dated back to the days of long ago, and had not
            been really overcome until one day in the Summer just past.</p>
          <p>Down on a particular old country place in the South is a particular old orchard in
            which is a particular gnarled old apple tree, nearly dead now and with good reason. On
            her sixth birthday, Josephine Carroll had suddenly conceived the notion that she was an
            extremely important per- <pb n="14" id="VAA3895-011"/>sonage in point of age. This
            conception was quickly followed in a natural sequence of thought by a consuming desire
            to know just how much she lacked of being as tall as her mother, whom she ardently
            longed to be like. She had immediately confided this big longing to Jack, aged nine, who
            was always ready with a way to help her out of her childish difficulties. Oftentimes,
            these ways proved to be the ways of a dreamer and resulted unhappily; but Josephine
            always forgot such times promptly. Her faith in Jack was absolute. On this occasion,
            they were building a play-house for the new birthday doll under their own particular
            apple tree. Resourceful Jack had at once scudded to the house for hammer and nails and
            had then driven a ten-penny deep into the heart of the tree trunk just above the tangled
            yellow hair of the ambitious little maid. Darkly designing, they had then wheedled their
            mother into the orchard under promise to show her the new play-house. Smiling and
            unsuspicious, obeying an urgent entreaty, she stood straight against the tree just to
            see if she were not as tall as the crotch. She did not understand the childish ruse
            until she had unexpectedly torn her dainty summer gown on a nail where <pb n="15"
              id="VAA3895-012"/>no nail should have been and, glancing inquiringly at the children
            for explanation, had seen the tears brimming in the eyes of one and had heard the
            jeering, boyish crow of the other.</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, me! But did n&apos;t you think you was big just &apos;cause you
            had a birthday! I&apos;ll have one Christmas and then I&apos;ll show you what it
            is to be really big, sis. What a heap of growin&apos; you&apos;ll have to do!
            You &apos;ll prob&apos;ly be as tall as mother &apos;bout when
            you&apos;re forty and ready to die.&quot;</p>
          <p>It had been a great disappointment for the proud six-year-old.</p>
          <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell you what to do, Josephine,&quot; the mother had said,
            consolingly. &quot;Every birthday, you have Jack drive a new nail over your head and
            we&apos;ll see how many nails it takes before you reach this one which I will drive
            in now and which means me.&quot;</p>
          <p>She had laughed merrily, the queenly young mother, as with awkward fingers she drove in
            the big nail; and it had proved an alluring game for the child until she was thirteen
            years old. Early on this anniversary of her natal day, she had stamped an impatient foot
            in chagrin at the discouraging space of tree trunk left between her last nail and that
            one away up there nearly to <pb n="16" id="VAA3895-013"/>the crotch, which meant her
            mother. There had been no one to see her outburst of temper but Jack, and Jack at
            sixteen was more loyal than he had been at nine; so she had announced calmly upon
            reentering the house that she should never drive another nail--it was so very
            childish--she was almost grown now, and, &quot;I think I have outgrown such babyish
            amusements, don&apos;t you, mother?&quot; she had asked sedately, and Jack had
            only smiled.</p>
          <p>Josephine had kept her word faithfully until her twenty-fourth birthday. She knew then
            that there could never be a recurrence of the visits to the old apple tree and she drove
            her last nail, her eyes blinded with tears for her who had instituted the childish game
            to comfort a childish sorrow, and who had gone from her since her last birthday; and
            then she smiled through her tears to see how much of a lack there yet was--and she was
            twenty-four years old that day. She found a big stone that had served many different
            purposes in the old housekeeping days, and standing upon it, kissed the highest nail
            very tenderly before going back into the house to write to Jack that she would be ready
            to join him on his claim at the beginning of the New Year.</p>
          <pb n="17" id="VAA3895-014"/>
          <p>No, Josephine was not tall, although it may be that her longing after the unattainable
            nail had helped to give that little lift to her chin which was forever giving the
            impression of greater height than she possessed.</p>
          <p>The wolfskin which she stroked and of which Jack was so boyishly proud, because it was
            the first big game he had brought down since coming West, was the only carpet the bare
            little room afforded, but there was a good flooring which gave the Southern
            boy&apos;s claim shanty an air of comfort and substantiality that many another
            lacked in those days of the early nineties. The brother, who had not told the real
            reason for Josephine&apos;s sudden aversion to a game of long ago, had builded for
            her the best that he could, fifteen miles from a railroad, with the river running
            between. The house was squarely and compactly built of logs and there were two rooms and
            an attic. He meant to stay and he wanted very much that Josephine should stay, too. For
            this, his old friends and neighbors in the South called him a visionary, while his new
            friends and neighbors of the West called him more or less good-naturedly a tenderfoot
            and a pilgrim. There were those, too, who designated him by even harsher names <pb
              n="18" id="VAA3895-015"/>than these, deeming it criminal incompetency to bring a
            gentlewoman to this land, bleak with Winter. But neither Jack nor Josephine cared a whit
            what anybody said or thought concerning this affair that they held to be entirely their
            own. Not only was Josephine determined to stay, but she had also filed on the quarter
            adjoining Jack&apos;s on the north and meant to live there when the time came.</p>
          <p>The wind arose along in the afternoon of this traditionally warm day in February. It
            was a warm, fawning wind out of the southwest until it suddenly whipped around to the
            northwest, a signal for the experienced to look well to their woodboxes and coalbins and
            to gather their families in from herd and barn and country school. The wind increased in
            volume steadily, and presently it began to snow. Not until then did John Calhoun
            Carroll, late a gentleman of the Atlantic seaboard, now a homesteader in the wonderful
            hill region lying west of the Missouri River, turn his eyes, brown like
            Josephine&apos;s, from their dreamy contemplation of these same hills, reluctantly,
            and, stifling a yawn, arise to his feet.</p>
          <p>&quot;There is a storm coming, Jo,&quot; he said, carelessly. &quot;I think
            I had better ride after the cattle <pb n="19" id="VAA3895-016"/>and get them safely in
            the corral before it gets any worse.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot; Had n&apos;t you better let them shift for themselves
            to-night?&quot; asked Josephine, a tiny line of concern wrinkling her forehead.
            &quot;Look, Jack! It is snowing so hard that the hills are almost blotted out
            already.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;All the more reason why I should be up and doing,&quot; said Jack,
            cheerfully. &quot;Let them be blotted from sight; just so the Broken Key be not
            blotted from existence.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, if you must--&quot; said Josephine, reluctantly, &quot;but I do
            hate to see you go. Here, tie up your throat, button your overcoat up tight, and be sure
            to hold your head down and do not swallow any snow wind,&quot; she cautioned,
            solicitously.</p>
          <p>Jack laughed. He had always laughed at Josephine&apos;s solicitudes, even in the
            old days. But he liked them. He had always liked them; but he liked them more than ever
            after a year&apos;s yearning through voluntary exile. The rude door slammed behind
            him violently, caught by a quick, resistless shock of wind that came nosing warningly
            down the valley of the great, bleak, frozen river. With a laugh of indifference, Jack
              <pb n="20" id="VAA3895-017"/>ran with the wind to the corral, saddled and bridled his
            own particular cow pony, flung himself into the saddle, bent his head and began forcing
            his way northward through the driving snow to the succor of fifty head of Broken Key
            cattle, winter-grazing beyond the big gulch three-quarters of a mile away.</p>
          <p>Josephine, watching at the small, square window, saw her brother disappear into the
            white void of the storm to the north and then the chill in the room crept to her heart
            and remained there. It grew steadily colder. The fine, driving snow beat and swirled
            against the window, and, drifting in, lay unmelted upon the sill. Conscious at last of
            the increasing cold, she replenished the fire, stuffing huge sticks of driftwood into
            the stove till the fire roared and crackled and went rumbling up the chimney, lured to a
            mad revelry of abandoned spirits by the persistent call of the storm fiend. The renewed
            warmth did not heal Josephine&apos;s restlessness. She put on the tea kettle with
            some vague idea of an early supper, though night was yet far distant. When it was
            singing bravely away, making a gallant effort to outwit the pervading gloom, she sat
            down with her darning materials, but paused dismayed be- <pb n="21"
              id="VAA3895-018"/>fore the immensity of the yawning discrepancies in the heels of
            Jack&apos;s hose. Poor old Jack, there had been no one to mend for him all these
            many months; but it was far too gigantic a task for her to undertake now with that
            terrible wind pounding on her nerves. The work dropped from her idle fingers and fell to
            the floor.</p>
          <p>When an hour had passed, she went to the window again, where a trembling seized her.
            What had become of the sheds and the corral and all the trees! Not even a dark,
            indistinct blur of them showed through the dead white pall that lay between--and Jack
            had not yet returned. She opened the door hurriedly and stepped out. She was immediately
            engulfed in a choking whirl of icy snow that blinded and strangled her, while a wild
            gust of wind driving down from the hills and sweeping around the corner of the house
            caught her unawares and forced her to her knees. Gasping, she crept back into the house,
            glad in her heart for the cosy strength of its stanchly constructed walls that scarcely
            shook in the grasp of the mad wind. Hitherto she had been vaguely uneasy because of
            Jack&apos;s long absence, but now she became seriously alarmed. She began to realize
            that this was no common storm.</p>
          <pb n="22" id="VAA3895-019"/>
          <p>When another half-hour had passed away and still Jack had not returned, the conviction
            stole coldly over her that her brave young pioneer brother, the last of his name, with
            whom and for whom she had so unhesitatingly chosen to cast in her lot in this big,
            lonesome Northwest country, was either lost or some serious accident had befallen him.
            Nothing else could have kept him so long away from her while this strange, terrifying
            storm was screaming outside. What could she do? Go in search of him? The heartbreaking
            uselessness of such a course, when she remembered how savagely and instantly she had
            been choked back when she but stepped outside the door, whitened her face with
            apprehension and brought hot tears of impotent rebellion to her eyes. Perhaps her island
            neighbor might help her. It was a comforting thought--this one that she was not
            altogether alone in this infinity of blank whiteness. The island was not really an
            island, after all, in winter time when the water was low. She should not have to cross
            any ice at all--if she could only find the way. She had never been there nor had she
            ever seen the woodchopper, but she knew where his log cabin was--one could see the light
            of it at night when the forest was bare, <pb n="23" id="VAA3895-020"/>--and she knew
            also the law of the hanging latch string in the plains country. More than all, she knew
            that she could no longer sit idle and sheltered while Jack battled for his very breath,
            maybe, out there in the swirl of the snow. Even if she died for it, she must do
            something. She had heard Jack say that Frank LaDue was an old-timer--surely then he knew
            the ways of such storms as this one and would know how to go about instituting a search
            for a missing man. If she could only find the way! Well, at least she could try to find
            it.</p>
          <p>She went about her preparations very carefully. She had felt the icy touch of the storm
            once and it had not been a pleasant experience. She put on her riding leggings,
            overshoes, and heavy jacket, wrapped her head and throat well in a big shawl, stuffed
            the stove full again from the dwindling pile of driftwood, opened the door and stepped
            out. Instantly, her mouth and eyes were filled with the fine driving ice particles and
            she was forced to steady herself by holding desperately to the door knob while she tried
            to cough up the cold wind and snow that was choking her. Before making a fresh start,
            she let the shawl fall over her face and found breathing easier, <pb n="24"
              id="VAA3895-021"/>although now she must needs pick her way from memory and intuition
            northward along the river, then across the rough, dry bed of the slough, and again
            northward into the heart of the heavily timbered island, in the teeth of the wind almost
            all the way.</p>
          <p>Many, many times she stumbled and fell, but always she picked herself up and fought on.
            Sometimes she put back the shawl from before her face in order not to lose her slight
            knowledge of location. Always she held her course close to the trees along the bank in
            order to keep the direction. She was soon very tired. She wondered if she might not lie
            down and rest for a minute. It would give her strength to press on. She fought this
            drowsy inclination desperately for a long time, but it would have conquered her
            presently had she not been all at once conscious of a slight surcease in the beat of the
            ice-impregnated air against her and wonderingly saw before her a dim dark outline
            showing but hauntingly through the heavy meshes of the curtain of the storm. When she
            realized that this must be the house she was seeking, she gave a little sob of relief
            and went stumblingly up to the door. It was opened almost instantly.</p>
          <pb n="25" id="VAA3895-022"/>
          <p>&quot;Blamed if it ain&apos;t you!&quot; said the owner of the shanty,
            wonderingly, and as if the dishevelled and exhausted young creature on his doorstep had
            been very lately in his musings. He stared at her curiously, regardless of the biting
            and laden wind that pushed its way into the room, snapped at some saucepans on the table
            and sent them crashing to the floor.</p>
          <p>&quot;I think--I had better--I think--you must let me in,&quot; said Josephine,
            stammeringly, glancing forlornly at the big figure in the doorway, so effectually
            shutting in the longed-for warmth of the untidy, bachelor room.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, sure, what am I thinkin&apos; about? Come along in and thaw yourself
            out there by the fire,&quot; said Frank LaDue, after a hesitation that was not
            perceptible to Josephine because of her overpowering fatigue. &quot;I call that
            downright ornery in me to keep a poor little frost-bitten doggie like you
            standin&apos; out in this blizzard, I do for a fact. Just herd your feet up there to
            the stove and make yourself to home.&quot;</p>
          <p>Josephine crept in gladly and sank down upon a chair while a pleasing stupor gradually
            stole over her senses. She was speedily brought back to the present, however, by her
            host, who was <pb n="26" id="VAA3895-023"/>somewhat roughly demanding of her an
            explanation of the fool&apos;s errand that had brought her out in the blizzard. He
            still stood, and standing, seemed a colossal figure indeed to the girl crouching by the
            rusty but roaring stove. His size and general air of capability inspired her with hope.
            His head almost reached the low, dingy ceiling. His hands were jammed down into his
            trousers&apos; pockets. Josephine sprang up, her lethargy slipping from her in the
            shock of her momentarily forgotten but now vividly remembered purpose.</p>
          <p>&quot;Mr. LaDue, it is Jack,&quot; she began earnestly. &quot;He started
            after the cattle, oh, a long time ago--hours ago, I think--and--he has not come home. He
            is lost in this terrible storm. He can never find his way through it. He does not know
            anything about your kind of storms--they are so awful. Oh, if he had only stayed safely
            at home! What did the cattle matter?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Which goes to show that all the idjits ain&apos;t dead yet,&quot;
            said the islander, with what seemed like heartless indifference, taking his hands from
            his pockets only long enough to roll and light a cigarette. &quot;Unless he is
            already laid out flat in some gully where he stopped to rest.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;And it would be useless for me to try to find <pb n="27" id="VAA3895-024"
            />him,&quot; said Josephine, shuddering wofully because of what LaDue had just
            said.</p>
          <p>&quot;You are right there, my girl,&quot; said LaDue, &quot;it would be
            worse than useless. If he can&apos;t find his way, he surely can&apos;t expect a
            slip of a woman critter to find it for him. Like enough he&apos;ll come out of it
            all right anyway. So stop worryin&apos; about it, and you can bunk right here by the
            fire to-night and in the mornin&apos; you can skin across the slough good and early
            and I&apos;ll bet you find him safe and sound in bed, wonderin&apos; where the
            devil you are. Take off your duds and I&apos;ll get supper ready.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I thought--I hoped--&quot; faltered Josephine, and stopped. Controlling
            herself, she went on with a quiet dignity. &quot;I had thought that perhaps to you
            who have lived in this country so many years this might not be so dreadful a storm after
            all. I have made a mistake. I do not ask anything of you. I must go myself.&quot;
            She started for the door a little blindly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why did n&apos;t you say that was what you was after in the
            beginning?&quot; demanded her host, gruffly. &quot;There ain&apos;t no more
            use in my huntin&apos; for that there tenderfoot in this blizzard than
            there&apos;d be in lookin&apos; for an unbranded calf after <pb n="28"
              id="VAA3895-025"/>an Injun had been hangin&apos; round for a spell, and that
            &apos;s as strong an argument as I can put up. No tellin&apos; where in thunder
            he is by this time. Anyway, his chances o&apos; showin&apos; up safe and sound
            are a damned sight better than yours or mine would be o&apos; runnin&apos; down
            that yearlin&apos; and ropin&apos; him in this cussed storm. He comes with the
            wind, but we&apos;d have to face it, and God A&apos;mighty knows nobody could
            stand that long. Supposin&apos; I managed to make the gulch--he &apos;d ten to
            one have passed me on the way. Frank LaDue ain&apos;t no coward--but he&apos;s
            only got one life to live and he don&apos;t believe in throwin&apos; it away on
            a fool&apos;s errand.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Please do not think that I ask--or expect--any man to risk his life for a
            forlorn hope,&quot; said Josephine, with a trembling voice. &quot;I came to you
            because I did not know--the situation was so--desperate--and there was no one
            else.&quot; She wrapped her shawl about her and again started for the door.</p>
          <p>&quot;You ain&apos;t goin&apos; out again, are you? Say, I don&apos;t
            like that. You&apos;d better stay. If you get lost, that kid&apos;ll have to
            answer for the death o&apos; both o&apos; you. You would n&apos;t like that,
            would you? This ain&apos;t no country for green kids and women, <pb n="29"
              id="VAA3895-026"/>nohow. It beats the devil how some folks think they can cut away
            from everything they&apos;ve been used to and educated for, just set down on a
            God-forsaken prairie in Winter that they don&apos;t know nothin&apos; about,
            fold their white hands and expect bread and butter to come a-walkin&apos; up to
            &apos;em on legs and pop down their gullets like a snake-charmed bird without
            puttin&apos; them to the trouble o&apos; chewin&apos;, even. They feel hurt
            if it does n&apos;t come jest that easy. Some folks seem to think good money grows
            on bushes out in this here country. Well, mebbe &apos;t would if there were any
            bushes for it to grow on. Snow banks and baked grass and dry sand don&apos;t make a
            first-rate soil for that kind o&apos; crop. But about the kid. If you don&apos;t
            find him at home in the morning, well, there &apos;s no earthly way o&apos;
            helpin&apos; it--and no one to blame but himself. You stay here to-night. That
            &apos;s the advice of an old-timer and it &apos;s free.&quot;</p>
          <p>Without a word in reply, but with a sob in her throat, Josephine turned and left him.
            He followed her to the door and watched her as the storm caught her up and whirled her
            into its midst. There was the same curious smile upon his face that had been there when
            he confronted <pb n="30" id="VAA3895-027"/>this girl on his threshold. When she had
            disappeared into the swirl, he shut the door and sat down upon the chair Josephine had
            so lately vacated. Presently, he arose, reached for his hat, twirled it around
            undecidedly, sat down again, rolled and lighted a fresh cigarette, got up, slouched to
            the door as if still undecided, and put his hand upon the knob.</p>
          <p>As for Josephine, she made her way with great difficulty back to the house. Jack was
            not there. Early night was closing in. The room was fast growing cold. She replenished
            the dying fire mechanically, numb to all feeling but that a weak and untried girl stood
            alone in a darkening world to defy the cruel arrogance of the elements and the cowardly
            helplessness of man. Although it was not yet altogether night, she put a light in the
            window, steeled herself anew against the despair that was creeping over her, opened the
            door and once more stepped outside. She turned her face resolutely to the north--to find
            Jack.</p>

          <p><hi rend="b">B</hi>Y the time Jack reached the far side of the gulch where the cattle
            were usually to be found the storm was in full swing. The cold was intense. The snow
            blinded and choked him. The wind seemed possessed of seven devils in the strength of its
            will not only to halt his further progress, but to force him back over the way he had
            just come, for every inch of which he had fought doggedly and persistently. The like of
            such a winter storm he had never seen or felt before, but he pressed on undaunted by its
            strange intensity.</p>
          <p>He was a slender young fellow, but was knit together with muscular litheness and was
            perhaps as much at home in the saddle as any denizen of the range, barring dexterity
            with the rope. He had begun riding at an early age when his slim brown legs scarcely
            reached the beginning of the downward curve of the broad-backed farm horses, as he rode
            them to water by grace of the <pb n="32" id="VAA3895-029"/>farm hands, who always liked
            the daring little chap well. The training thus early begun was continued through the
            later years, when his father allowed him to ride the hunters, only occasionally at
            first; after a while, whenever and wherever it pleased him. He had not been long in the
            cattle country before he discovered that there was a vast difference in temperament and
            training between a Kentucky hunter and a range-bred, mongrel cayuse, but he did not
            hesitate in adapting himself to the changed conditions in horse flesh and soon had as
            complete a mastery over the obstinate whims of his cow ponies as he had ever possessed
            over the daintier fancies of his thoroughbreds of the past. He was a good rider.
            Seasoned cowmen granted him that distinction ungrudgingly. He had yet to prove his
            &quot;staying qualities.&quot; It was generally considered only a question of a
            little time when the &quot;young un&quot; should have fretted away his limited
            stock of endurance and have slipped away in a night and the wide spaces would know him
            no more.</p>
          <p>Jack himself had no doubts or qualms shadowing his future. Even the gloom and menace of
            the storm pressing around him left his sunny <pb n="33" id="VAA3895-030"/>spirit
            unterrorized. It did not occur to him for a long time that he was in serious personal
            danger. Although he could scarcely see an animal six feet away, he was conscious of no
            premonitory dread for his own safety. If he could only round up his whole bunch--which
            was not so many but that one choked down and left behind would be a serious
            misfortune--and get it safely headed for home, he had not the shadow of a misgiving as
            to his own ability to find his way with the ice-laden wind at his back instead of
            cutting and slapping and tearing away at his face and driving down his throat.</p>
          <p>He could not be sure that he had all of his cattle when he finally headed for home, but
            he was growing strangely tired all at once, and some way it did n&apos;t seem to
            matter so much as it did a while ago, whether his herd was saved intact or whether two
            or three dropped by the wayside. Cattle were only cattle anyway. He found himself
            thinking, with the morbid pathos of one forever on the outside, of Josephine&apos;s
            fireside, of the warm glow from the open drafts of the stove, of the good smell of
            sizzling bacon and the taste of the flapjacks browned in its gravy. It began to seem to
            him as he <pb n="34" id="VAA3895-031"/>plodded drowsily along that these things,
            delicious as they were, belonged to a far distant past, a past of dreams, unreal, fast
            slipping away, while he himself must just trudge along--and along--through the cold,
            blinding, heartless swirl of the snow. He shook himself savagely, resenting the physical
            weakness that directed his thoughts into such morbid channels. Through the white void,
            he could see dim, dark shapes plunging ahead, now appearing, now disappearing, like
            frolicsome ghosts of haunted slumber, the shrieking of the gale covering up the sound of
            their running footfalls. The rain of the morning had now frozen into the ground, which
            presented a hard, smooth surface, over which the snow was blown furiously, skipping into
            the air again, finding but little resting place on the glassy level. In places, however,
            it had begun to drift, especially in the gulches and washouts. So completely was
            everything blotted out by the storm that the first intimation Jack had that he had
            reached the big gulch on his return journey was when his cow pony with accustomed feet
            took the first downward slip of the steep incline. There was considerable drift in the
            gulch through which the horse floundered <pb n="35" id="VAA3895-032"/>gallantly while
            Jack gave him the rein and trusted to his instinct to pick up the trail on the other
            side of the drift.</p>
          <p>&quot;Suffering Moses!&quot; cried Jack, suddenly and sharply, as he felt the
            first shock of the stumble. He jerked the loosened rein quickly, but it was too late. At
            some time, water had washed out an ugly hole on one side of the path in the bottom of
            the gulch. Jack had known that it was there. So doubtless had his horse; but in the
            blinding storm it was impossible to see it or to locate its position definitely. Into
            this washout the pony stumbled and horse and rider were thrown violently to the ground.
            The horse scrambled up quickly, but Jack lay quite still for a moment, the sudden, sharp
            pain that seemed to originate in his right leg and then to spread instantaneously over
            his whole body, obliterating all sense of everything but the sense of its own agony. It
            was not for long. Through the mists of his fast creeping numbness, one thought stood
            forth startlingly clear, and that was the absolute hopelessness of his situation should
            his horse leave him and go home alone. The thought spurred him to a desperate reach for
            the bridle rein. It was too late. The horse, apparently <pb n="36" id="VAA3895-033"
            />unhurt, had scrambled to its feet and before Jack could prevent gave a lunge forward
            and started up the other side of the gulch.</p>
          <p>&quot;You--you--traitor,&quot; cried Jack, aloud, and fell back upon his bed of
            snow, despairing, yet with a half smile on his lips as if to him there was something
            comical in the contemplation of his utter helplessness. He was of a people to whom
            personal fear was a crime; but he was also of a people who never gave up--till they had
            to. He was in intense pain--he thought his leg must be broken--a pain that made his eyes
            filmy with unseeing so that it was not the snow alone that blinded him. Even breathing
            was pain, for he was choked by the cutting snow. But he did not intend to lie there and
            freeze to death without an effort to prove the futility of all effort. Perhaps he might
            even crawl the rest of the way home. He should at least try it--just as soon a he
            recovered a little from the shock of his fall and the pain of his broken leg.
            Three-quarters of a mile through fast drifting snow did not present a very hopeful
            outlook, but there was nothing else left to do. There was no one to help him in all the
            world except Josephine. There was no one to miss him or even to <pb n="37"
              id="VAA3895-034"/>know that he needed help--except Josephine. The island woodchopper
            was the only man on this side of the river for many a mile, and there was no earthly way
            of his knowing his neighbor&apos;s plight. The scant half-mile that separated their
            cabins might just as well have been ten for all the comfort or aid one could count on in
            this isolating storm. How could LaDue know that he had ridden into the void when he,
            Jack, could scarcely discern one of his own creatures six feet away? No, there was only
            Josephine, and the trouble was that Josephine would be sure to start out in search of
            him after a while. If it were not for that, perhaps he might snuggle down in the soft
            snow and rest--and perhaps sleep--until morning, or at least until the storm fell
            away--he was so very tired--but always there was Josephine. She would start out--there
            was nothing on earth that could prevent Josephine&apos;s coming to look for him--he
            knew Jo. When night came and he had not returned, she would come. There was not a doubt
            of it in the world. But she would never find him. She would get lost herself and die in
            the storm before ever she could come anywhere near the gulch. Even if she realized the
            utter foolhardiness of her <pb n="38" id="VAA3895-035"/>action, still would she come.
            For this reason, he must crawl home before she started out--if he could. He shook off
            the growing lassitude that was fast fettering his limbs, summoned all his powers of
            endurance to his aid, and began the slow, tortuous climb up the side of the gulch,
            dragging his useless leg painfully after him.</p>
          <p>He had almost gained the level when he slipped, lost his hold, and slid back almost to
            the bottom again. Even then he gripped his self-control so tightly that his will
            prevented him from losing consciousness, although he was dizzy with pain and laboring
            for breath and altogether exhausted after the gigantic effort he had made and its
            failure. He was in desperate straits. He knew it well. He had known it from the moment
            his grasp had fallen short of the dangling bridle rein. There had been a fighting chance
            only. He had taken it and failed. The only point to be considered now was whether or not
            there was any way to keep oneself from freezing to death until the storm abated. It
            would probably fall away towards morning. Not that it mattered much--only on account of
            Josephine. Always the thought of Josephine caused him to struggle <pb n="39"
              id="VAA3895-036"/>free of the almost overpowering desire to just lie still and
            rest.</p>
          <p>All at once, his listless gaze, in which there was no hope, was caught and held by the
            dark blur of an overhanging bank on the north side of the gulch and a very short
            distance away. He knew by the distinctness with which he could see its outlines through
            the white that the snow was drifting in front of it, leaving the hollow bare and helping
            to form a sort of cave where he might find shelter from the snow and wind--that is, if
            he could only get there.</p>
          <p>He did get there at last, and lay white and panting close up to the dirt side on the
            north, free from the cruel beat of the wind and bite of the snow for the first time
            since the door of the Broken Key had slammed behind him--hours ago. The relief was
            intense. It was not for long, however. The cold was bitter and he had so little strength
            left with which to fight it. His little sister Jo could never find him away up
            here--never--and how could he ever see her when she came into the gulch in search of him
            if she was able to get so far? Well, if he died and Jo did not, there was this
            comforting thought which he meant to hug to himself after a <pb n="40" id="VAA3895-037"
            />while to make the end easier--there were no better men nor more manly in all the wide
            world than the men of the range. They would see to it that little Jo went safely home
            again when it was all over. Suffering Moses! How cold it was! Funny how sleepy he was
            when it was not even dark as yet. Thank God, the pain in his leg had ceased. It was
            probably not broken after all. Suddenly he laughed a low, whimsical laugh at his own
            expense. He had actually been afraid that he was going to die--he had even nearly
            whimpered in maudlin self-pity because he had to die so uselessly--when instead of
            dying, he was merely going to sleep. He had mistaken the feeling. He was sleepy, sleepy,
            sleepy, that was all--not dying.</p>
          <p>&quot;Halloo--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--!&quot;</p>
          <p>It was a faint cry at first, but it grew steadily louder. Sometimes it seemed to come
            from one direction, sometimes from another exactly opposite. Sometimes it was loud and
            piercing as if cried directly at the heap of drifted snow up under the dark, overhanging
            bank. Again, it was fainter, as if cried down the valley and borne away on the wind. But
            always it grew stronger.</p>
          <pb n="41" id="VAA3895-038"/>
          <p>&quot;Halloo--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--!&quot;</p>
          <p>It was a weird cry, sounding through the fast gathering gloom.</p>
          <p>&quot;Halloo--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--!&quot;</p>
          <p>It was repeated many, many times before it gradually dawned upon the failing senses of
            the young homesteader that this thing that he heard and had been hearing so long was not
            a phantasy of a disordered brain, but a human voice, smothered and unnatural, maybe,
            because of the thick, undulating blanket it was compelled to penetrate, but a human
            voice none the less--and a man&apos;s voice at that. No woman--least of all,
            Josephine--had lung power to sustain so vigorous and prolonged a calling, storm-beaten
            as she would be after having come so far. He lay another minute after his big discovery,
            wondering drowsily what the man wanted. Doubtless he was lost, too. Funny that he
            himself in like straits had never thought to call for help. Perhaps the utter
            uselessness of it all had restrained him unconsciously. He had never once thought to
            call aloud and yet here was a fellow creature yelling lustily for succor and there was
            some one to hear him. Per- <pb n="42" id="VAA3895-039"/>haps had he called--He lay for
            another full minute, idly pitying the man&apos;s plight before the thought came to
            him that it might perhaps be well to give the poor fellow an answering hail. He had
            found good shelter. He would share it. He sat up dizzily, found that he could not bear
            the new position, and fell back again. The effort had taken all his reserve strength and
            he lay very quiet for a long time, placidly deaf to that insistent
            &quot;Halloo--o--o--&quot; out there in the swirl of the storm.</p>
          <p>&quot;Halloo--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--o--! Jack!&quot;</p>
          <p>Was it possible that the man said &quot;Jack&quot;? Why, Jack was his own name.
            Once more he struggled to a sitting posture.</p>
          <p>&quot;Halloo--o--!&quot; he cried, weakly, conscious that the cry which gave
            him so much pain and effort to make was riddled and blown to pieces long before it
            reached half way down the gulch.</p>
          <p>&quot;Halloo--o--!&quot; he cried again, striving desperately to make his voice
            carry. &quot;Halloo--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--o--! Halloo--o--o--!&quot; With each
            repetition, his voice grew stronger--until at last it was heard, for, &quot;Halloo,
              <pb n="43" id="VAA3895-040"/>where are you?&quot; came the shouted question
            immediately after his last call.</p>
          <p>&quot;Halloo--here--north bank--just over--&quot; his voice died away.</p>
          <p>&quot;Halloo, there, keep calling--I can&apos;t find you--halloo--o--o--!
            Halloo--o--o--! Keep calling!&quot;</p>
          <p>The words were fairly whipped from the mouth of the seeker, for he was heading directly
            up the north bank in the very face of the wind.</p>
          <p>&quot;Halloo--o--!&quot; came a faint response and then there were no more
            answers to the persistent calling. It had grown very quiet up there on the other side of
            the drift.</p>
          <p>When Jack regained consciousness, there was a comfortable feeling of warmth in his
            throat that satisfied him for the time being. Soon he felt with surprise that he was
            warm all over and extremely comfortable only for that sharp, jumping ache in his leg;
            and, how easy it was to breathe! The storm must have fallen away. He opened his heavy
            eyes. Josephine was softly chafing his hands. He saw her before he realized that he was
            lying upon his own bed and that the nightmare was ended. A brandy flask lay upon the
            table by the bedside. A light flared and splut- <pb n="44" id="VAA3895-041"/>tered in
            the window. Listening, he heard the howling of the wind as it swept around the corners
            of the house. It must be the night of the same day, and yet he felt infinitely
            older.</p>
          <p>&quot;I think--my leg is broken, Jo,&quot; he said, faintly, and added,
            smilingly, &quot;I&apos;m not a bird nor a chicken nor a dog, but I reckon
            you&apos;ll have to draw on your ancient experience in binding up the wounds of our
            old pets and practise on me. I&apos;m game. I promise not to faint. Let &apos;er
            go, Gallagher!&quot; He closed his eyes expectantly.</p>
          <p>&quot;A better one than I has done that for you already, Jack, dear boy,&quot;
            said Josephine, turning with a grateful smile to a weather-browned, muscular young
            fellow standing quietly by the fire. &quot;Your poor broken bones are all nicely
            set. You lost consciousness, you know, up there under the bank and--the man who found
            you carried you home and set your leg without your knowing anything about it. But you
            must n&apos;t talk any more, Jack. You will work yourself into a fever if you
            do.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Lucky dog--I--to fall plunk into the path of a doctor. How did it happen,
            Jo?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I do not think our friend--I have n&apos;t learned his name yet--is a
            doctor. He just knew how. <pb n="45" id="VAA3895-042"/>Will you go to sleep if I tell
            you how it happened? Promise me.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;All right. Let &apos;er go, Gallagher!&quot;</p>
          <p>His eyelids drooped with drowsiness. He saw the big, still figure by the fire through a
            far-removing haze of pain-coaxed sleep.</p>
          <p>&quot;I had left the house to look for you, Jack,&quot; began Josephine,
            quietly, &quot;but I had not gone very far when I met this gentleman. He had been
            caught in the storm and was hastening home, but when he learned that you were lost he
            just bundled me back into the house without any ceremony at all, put up his horse and
            struck out after you--all alone--Jack, these men of the West are God&apos;s
            own--&quot; her voice broke a little--&quot;and he found you and brought you
            back to me--and--&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;That was mighty clever of you, LaDue,&quot; said Jack, striving to keep
            awake until he had said what he wanted to say. &quot;You are a generous man. I have
            not quite understood you. I hope you will not hold it against me. Shake on it,
            won&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
          <p>The stranger approached the bedside and took the weak, extended hand in a warm, firm
            grasp.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am glad you are all right, Carroll,&quot; he said, <pb n="46"
              id="VAA3895-043"/>quietly, &quot;but your eyes play you false. You are suffering
            much pain. It blinds you. I am not LaDue, but Burrington. You remember Tom Burrington of
            the Seven-up, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>

          <head>THE BEGINNING OF A QUARREL</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE next day, rather early in the morning, the storm having died in
            the night, a young fellow with wide open, baby blue eyes, that softened wonderfully the
            stalwart, self-reliant effect of a pair of unusually broad shoulders, rode up to the
            door of the Broken Key.</p>
          <p>The Broken Key homestead-ranch had been thus quaintly called because of a little
            incident that had occurred shortly after young Carroll had taken up residence on his
            claim. He had just returned one day in the late Summer from a long ride to Velpen for
            the mail and, the time being ripe for choosing and registering a brand for his newly
            acquired stock, was thinking deeply about the subject when he suddenly broke his key in
            a vain attempt to turn it in a plugged keyhole. He had been very angry at first, but in
            the end had reasoned that he himself had been much at fault. He remembered having heard
            something, sometime, about the free-masonry that existed on the range in regard to the
            unwritten law of the hang- <pb n="48" id="VAA3895-045"/>ing latch string. It was very
            probable that some one in passing had resented the inhospitality of the locked door. He
            was genuinely sorry. He should not forget again. That same week, he perfected his design
            of a broken key and registered it upon the books of the county.</p>
          <p>&quot;The Boss said you was in need of a hand, so I thought I&apos;d just step
            up to see if I&apos;d do,&quot; said the young fellow with the baby blue eyes on
            the morning after the big storm. He was in manifest confusion in the presence of
            Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;Are n&apos;t you rather--young?&quot; asked Josephine, hesitatingly.
            She had come to the door in a morning gown of small-checked blue gingham and her
            unexpected daintiness served to enhance visibly the young man&apos;s
            embarrassment.</p>
          <p>&quot;Bless you,&quot; he grinned, awkwardly, &quot;I&apos;ve been
            punchin&apos; cows and wranglin&apos; horses since I was
            knee-high-to-a-grasshopper. That&apos;s my business, Misses.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Are you quite sure that you are old enough to vote?&quot; asked
            Josephine, smiling at his boyishly expressed self-esteem.</p>
          <p>&quot;You bet I am. Why, Misses, I ain&apos;t no yearlin&apos; nor yet a
            two-year old. I cut my eye teeth ages ago. Besides, I come from Texas. The <pb n="49"
              id="VAA3895-046"/>babes know how to herd down there and any old time they&apos;d a
            mind to call your Northern bluff at ranchin&apos; they&apos;d make you look
            exactly plumb like a balloon with a hole in it.&quot;</p>
          <p>All at once, his brief while of easy self-assertiveness passed away and it was as if it
            had never been. The laugh died while a vacant, wistful look crept into his eyes.</p>
          <p>&quot;Please, Misses, take me,&quot; he said, coaxingly, like a child.</p>
          <p>&quot;And you say Mr. Burrington sent you?&quot; questioned Josephine, trying
            to be wise and business-like for Jack&apos;s sake.</p>
          <p>&quot;He said your man was thrown and would have to lay off for a spell and he said
            I could come and help you out if I wanted to and you was agreeable. He said you had
            n&apos;t asked for no help but he knew you needed it and I could stay as long as you
            wanted me to and my place &apos;d be waitin&apos; for me at the Seven-up when
            you was through with me. I been punchin&apos; for the Boss for a year.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, I reckon you may stay until my brother is able to ride again,&quot;
            said Josephine. &quot;Many of the cattle have strayed--&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, and I was to tell you that some of your <pb n="50" id="VAA3895-047"
            />cattle was found feedin&apos; with a Seven-up bunch on the home range this
            mornin&apos; and that you ain&apos;t to worry about &apos;em because they
            are all right where they are and the Boss &apos;ll take care of
            &apos;em,&quot; interrupted the new hand, importantly.</p>
          <p>&quot;The rest need to feed. Will you see to them now?&quot; asked Josephine,
            quietly.</p>
          <p>It was thus that Henry Hoffman became a temporary resident of Jack Carroll&apos;s
            homestead.</p>
          <p>Three tedious weeks passed before the young Southerner was able even to make use of
            crutches. A doctor had come out from Velpen the third day after the accident, had
            approved cordially of Tom Burrington&apos;s amateur surgery, rebound the break, and
            had then left the patient to make his gallant fight with Josephine&apos;s help,
            only, against much pain and fever and delirium and the deadly weariness of inactivity.
            At the end of that time, he arose from his bed, hobbled painfully to the window and
            looked out, yearningly. Warm weather was fast setting in. There was a feeling of Spring
            in the air, though the gulches and draws were yet full of snow. The loftier hilltops
            only had thrust their crests, brown and brooding, from out the white-streaked under-
            world. Tier after tier of these sombre-capped <pb n="51" id="VAA3895-048"/>hills lay
            between the edge of the bottom land and the high horizon.</p>
          <p>&quot;To-morrow, Josephine, I ride to the Seven-up and bring back our strays. Yes,
            to-morrow sees me in the saddle again. You need not smile in such a superior fashion,
            Jo. I shall surely go if I want to.&quot; He was smiling, well-knowing his absolute
            inability to make his rash assertion good--but how he longed for the feel of leather
            between his knees once more! He thrummed on the pane with his thin hands
            impatiently.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why worry about the cattle?&quot; asked Josephine, calmly. &quot;Mr.
            Burrington sends us word that they are doing very well with his herd. You ought to be
            thankful that they drifted into such comfortable quarters during that terrible storm
            when they might have run till they starved or have fallen and frozen to death, instead
            of lamenting the fact that you cannot have your eyes upon them all the time. Next week,
            perhaps, if you take care of yourself, you may be able to ride to the Seven-up after
            your storm-strays. To-morrow, you may--&quot; she paused, tantalizingly. &quot;
            To-morrow, you may--hobble down to the barn,&quot; she concluded, as one granting a
            favor.</p>
          <pb n="52" id="VAA3895-049"/>
          <p>&quot;We&apos;ll see,&quot; grumbled the sick man, rebelliously.</p>
          <p>But when to-morrow came, he was content to take his crutches and hobble down to the
            barn. A few more brown peaks on the lower tiers had poked their heads free of the white
            blankets. The season of melting weather had begun in earnest. A horse in the ash sapling
            corral whinnied softly in pleased recognition of his long absent master. It was he who
            had deserted on the night of the big storm, but he was glad to feel the familiar
            presence again. He put out his nose for Jack to stroke and rubbed against his shoulder
            caressingly. The barnyard premises seemed otherwise deserted. The boy, Henry Hoffman,
            was out with the remnant of the herd. The young Texan had proved himself a good workman
            in spite of his apparent youthfulness. The homesteaders would have been glad to retain
            his services for an indefinite period had their resources warranted it. Resting his arms
            idly on the palings, drinking in the soft air with lazy content, Jack was presently
            aware that his horse was not the only other creature near. From the south side of the
            haystack every now and then came a glint of red. He watched it come and go with <pb
              n="53" id="VAA3895-050"/>indolent curiosity. It was not long before a red head with
            soft brown eyes appeared around the stack and returned his gaze placidly, still munching
            hay.</p>
          <p>&quot;Hello, there!&quot; he said aloud, in surprise. &quot;Why are
            n&apos;t you out with the herd, young fellow? Henry must be getting careless. Well,
            stuff a-plenty now, for you won&apos;t get away again in a hurry.&quot;</p>
          <p>He picked up his crutches and prepared to drive the straying calf into the protection
            of the corral.</p>
          <p>&quot;By the great jumpin&apos; Jerusalem,&quot; he whistled, softly,
            &quot;if the prodigal has n&apos;t returned! What a pity that in this instance
            the prodigal and the fatted calf are one and the same person. It would be funny, would
            n&apos;t it, to kill the fatted calf to make a feast for this prodigal. Why, are
            n&apos;t you the runaway, after all?&quot;</p>
          <p>The exclamation was called forth by the unexpected sight of a brand on the
            calf&apos;s side. One evening, fully a month before the great storm, this same calf,
            born the preceding Spring, had failed to return with the herd. It had been running with
            the cattle only a short time, as Jack had kept it at home and fed it with his own hands
              <pb n="54" id="VAA3895-051"/>after weaning it from its mother, whom he wanted for a
            milch cow. He had never branded it.</p>
          <p>&quot;You&apos;ve been sowing some wild oats, I&apos;m afraid, my
            lad,&quot; said Jack, &quot;but I hope you have learned your lesson and will be
            content to stay at home in the future. Hello! LaDue!&quot;</p>
          <p>The island woodchopper was riding slowly by, apparently with no intention of halting,
            but in answer to Jack&apos;s hail, he rode leisurely up to the corral and threw one
            leg over the pommel of his saddle and, thus resting, surveyed his neighbor with careless
            curiosity.</p>
          <p>&quot;You see I&apos;m out again,&quot; said Jack, sociably inclined.
            &quot;I hope soon to be on my cowboy legs again.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You&apos;re lookin&apos; sort o&apos; peaked, &apos;pears to
            me,&quot; said LaDue.</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s just because Josephine has made such a house plant of me
            since my accident,&quot; explained Jack, with a smile. &quot;That was a
            tolerably good-sized blizzard, was n&apos;t it? I hope you don&apos;t have many
            such.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I was never out in a worse,&quot; said LaDue.</p>
          <p>&quot;Then you were out in it, after all,&quot; said Jack, suddenly grown
            serious. &quot;I--did not know.&quot;</p>
          <p>The man flushed through his heavy coat of <pb n="55" id="VAA3895-052"/>tan. He was
            oddly embarrassed. &quot;I--tried to make the gulch after the girl left,&quot;
            he said, slowly, &quot;but it was so blamed uncomfortable that I soon gave it up
            and--came home. I looked for you quite a spell.&quot; He spoke hesitatingly, as if
            he had not meant it to be known that he had been out in the storm and was sorry for his
            inadvertent admission.</p>
          <p>&quot;That was mighty good of you,&quot; said Jack, earnestly. &quot;I am
            glad that you--tried. By the way, LaDue,&quot; he continued, relapsing into
            good-natured raillery. &quot;I wish you&apos;d tell me how your brand managed to
            stick on to my calf without so much as a &apos;By your leave, kind sir.&apos;
            Pretty soon I&apos;ll be accusing you of cattle rustling if you don&apos;t rope
            onto a good explanation.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Your calf! Well, I like your nerve!&quot; said LaDue, laughing grimly, as
            he glanced critically at the animal in the corral. &quot;How do you make that out,
            Carroll, when the calf is mine?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You must have branded him by mistake,&quot; said Jack, still smiling,
            though a vague doubt began stirring in his mind. He had never understood his odd,
            profane neighbor. &quot;Why, I raised this fellow by hand, so to speak. I kept him
            close to the house and barn after having him <pb n="56" id="VAA3895-053"/>weaned and fed
            him myself until about a month before the storm. I can&apos;t be mistaken,
            LaDue,&quot; he concluded, boyishly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Neither can I,&quot; responded LaDue, a little gruffly, &quot;and I
            say that I raised that calf myself. I cannot possibly be mistaken. You may call me a
            cattle thief if you will. It&apos;s all one to me. How did that calf get
            here?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;He wandered here of his own free will, I reckon,&quot; said Jack,
            perplexedly. &quot;I found him eating serenely away at my haystack yonder. Most
            animals will come home finally if left to themselves,&quot; he added,
            obstinately.</p>
          <p>The man broke into a laugh of ironical amusement.</p>
          <p>&quot;Say, kid, why did n&apos;t you brand your calf while it was
            followin&apos; its mother? That &apos;s a habit a cattleman gets into
            A&apos;mighty quick. Why did n&apos;t you, eh?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, I just neglected it,&quot; said Jack, frankly. &quot;He was
            around the house all the time until he was put into the herd and then I drove him in
            with the rest of the cattle every night until he was lost. I thought I could keep track
            of him, all right. I meant to brand him after the Spring round-up.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="57" id="VAA3895-054"/>
          <p>He was getting very tired and leaned heavily against the fence, his face pale and thin,
            his brown eyes luminous with the fever of fatigue.</p>
          <p>&quot;What a tale for cowmen! They don&apos;t do business that way, Carroll. I
            don&apos;t, and I don&apos;t pretend to be anything but a woodchopper. But a man
            can&apos;t live among cattlemen without imbibin&apos; some of their goll-darned
            common sense. Leastwise, I can&apos;t. I branded that there calf as soon as I found
            him taggin&apos; his mother. It &apos;s the safest way, friend.&quot;
            Suddenly, he leaned down with an unexpected touch of friendliness in his gruff voice.
            &quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; he said, with grave significance, &quot;if
            you have really lost a calf, but I&apos;m sorrier if--you have n&apos;t. The
            boys don&apos;t stand for no foolin&apos;, and you&apos;re pretty young,
            kid. They&apos;d be rather rough with you. Don&apos;t begin it, young fellow.
            I&apos;m in earnest. Get out of the country if you can&apos;t make a
            livin&apos; no other way--but whatever you do, don&apos;t begin it. I
            don&apos;t hold this against you, you&apos;re young and green--I can understand.
            But take my advice and get out.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Of course, LaDue,&quot; said Jack, wearily--he was very tired now,
            &quot;I do not want to quarrel with you; so, although I am positive the calf is <pb
              n="58" id="VAA3895-055"/>mine, you may take him if you like. There is some mistake. I
            do not doubt that you are honest in your belief, but neither do I doubt my own eyes.
            Take him. He is yours now at any rate. We will say no more about it. Only--&quot; a
            sudden flash lighted up his tired eyes--&quot;don&apos;t call me a cattle thief
            again, neighbor. I might--resent it, you know. So long.&quot;</p>
          <p>LaDue looked curiously at the younger man for a moment. He shrugged his shoulders
            tolerantly. &quot;Good,&quot; he said, briefly. &quot;I like your grit,
            anyway. Fight it out for yourself if you will.&quot;</p>
          <p>He opened the gate of the corral, drove out the disputed calf, and then continued his
            leisurely way islandwards, driving the calf before him.</p>
          <p>&quot;You can prove it, Jack,&quot; said Josephine, indignantly, a little
            later, to Jack, who lay upon the bed worn out after his first exertion.
            &quot;Prosecute him. We will have our own.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;That&apos;s the rub,&quot; said Jack, quietly. &quot;We cannot
            prove it and we are strangers in a strange land. He may be as innocent as we are. It
            looks, though, as if he had taken advantage of its being <pb n="59" id="VAA3895-056"
            />unbranded, does n&apos;t it? Well, the incident is closed and we shall say no more
            about it. But mark you, Jo, if it should ever happen again I shall fight it out to the
            last ditch. Remember that.&quot;</p>

          <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
          <head>ONJIJITKA</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE following morning, Josephine rode up into the hills to the west
            of the Broken Key ranch. She rode astride, for Jack had insisted that she ride so. The
            hills to be climbed were high, and the ways to their summits were steep. The gulches
            were deep and narrow, and the cut-aways ugly. Many a deceptive washout lay concealed
            behind some innocent-looking cedar sapling or bunch of the hard-leaved soap-weed. One
            did well not only to be wary in choosing one&apos;s trail, but to be sure of
            one&apos;s firmness and equipoise in the saddle. So Josephine felt very mannish and
            confident on that day, riding slowly over the hills. Jack, who had still to wait a
            little before he could be strong enough to ride again, had begged her to be careful, and
            she was being careful. She knew that the bluffs and draws, with their blind trails, were
            vastly different from the gentle slopes of her home land. But she also knew that Jack
            had given her a <pb n="61" id="VAA3895-058"/>good horse--a native of these hills and one
            which had been gently broken because she, Josephine, was coming West to ride him.</p>
          <p>She was trying the mettle of her new companion and was finding it good. She had always
            made a companion of her riding horses. She was never content until all the little tricks
            of temper, manifestations of nervousness, little differences in the niceties of bit
            control, all the dislikes and the affectations of the new partnership were as a printed
            page for her just and comprehensive reading. She liked the high spirit and endurance of
            this rough-coated creature of the range, accepted him joyously and set about to win his
            love and confidence in return, because it might be that some time much would be required
            of him for her sake.</p>
          <p>The day had become damp and cloudy with moisture, and the wind, rising lightly out of
            the southwest, went skimming over the hilltops with soft, sibilant whisperings. Someway,
            it carried a little chill with it, even though it was a promise of melting weather still
            to come. Josephine, pausing a moment at the brow of a hill, where the indistinct trail
            she had been unconsciously pursuing dipped into a valley, hesitated to go <pb n="62"
              id="VAA3895-059"/>farther, and thought of the dinner that it was her lot to prepare, a
            household task that she, unaccustomed to its exactions, had forgotten while the sun
            shone.</p>
          <p>Into the range of her vision as she gazed thoughtfully across the valley, rode a
            horse-woman. This rider did not pause on the opposite hilltop as Josephine had paused,
            but rode steadily down into the ravine, apparently without knowledge of the near
            presence of another human life in the solemn solitude of the hills. She came out of the
            southwest and she rode easily and as well as Josephine rode, astride. It was not until
            after she had crossed the valley and was climbing the hill where Josephine awaited her
            approach with a curious little throb of something akin to homesickness engendered by the
            unexpected nearness of one of her own kind that Josephine perceived, with a shock of
            disappointment, that the stranger&apos;s feet were encased in beaded moccasins. With
            this rather startling exception, however, she was dressed much as Josephine was dressed,
            with leggings, dark blue serge skirt, short jacket, and fur cap. This was noticeable,
            however, that while Josephine&apos;s cap was of sealskin, hers was of beaver, a
            relic of the days when her trapper <pb n="[]" id="VAA3895-060"/><figure>
              <p>&quot;&apos;How do you do?&apos; answered the stranger, in a clear,
                sweet voice&quot;</p>
            </figure>
            <pb n="63" id="VAA3895-061"/>ancestors still found beaver along the waterways of the
            Dakotas.</p>
          <p>&quot;How do you do,&quot; said Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;How do you do,&quot; answered the stranger, in a clear, sweet voice. She
            stopped before Josephine, and it was then that Josephine received the second surprise of
            the unexpected encounter. The moccasins had belied the stranger, after all. Her skin was
            almost as fair as Josephine&apos;s own and her cheeks were flushed with color. Her
            head was as proudly held, with even a touch of its patrician poise. Her dark eyes met
            Josephine&apos;s frankly curious gaze with reserve.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am, you know,&quot; she added, unexpectedly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Are what?&quot; asked Josephine, in surprise.</p>
          <p>&quot;Dakotah.&quot;</p>
          <p>Josephine held out her hand with a quick gesture of impulsive friendliness. &quot;I
            should never have guessed it,&quot; she said, honestly. &quot;But that need not
            hinder our being friends, need it? I have been afraid that I was going to be very
            lonely, sometimes. I did not know there were any girls west of the river. My name is
            Josephine Carroll and I live at the Broken Key.&quot;</p>
          <p>The girl hesitated a moment, drawing back <pb n="64" id="VAA3895-062"/>slightly; then
            she changed her mind and accepted Josephine&apos;s proffered hand-clasp with grave
            formality.</p>
          <p>&quot;My name is Onjijitka, which in English means Rosebud, and I live on the
            Rosebud Reservation,&quot; she said simply.</p>
          <p>&quot;That is a very pretty name,&quot; replied Josephine. &quot;I am
            afraid it will take me some time to learn to pronounce it correctly in Indian, so for
            the present, at least, I will call you Rosebud, if you don&apos;t
            mind.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;They called me Rosebud at school, and nearly everybody around here calls me
            that, except the Indians,&quot; the girl said.</p>
          <p>&quot;You were going toward the river?&quot; questioned Josephine. &quot;I
            was about to return and will ride with you if you do not object. I am my
            brother&apos;s housekeeper and must hasten to get the dinner pot to
            boiling,&quot; she chatted easily, with a mixture of girlish pride in the new
            dignity of her position and an honest desire to show a friendly spirit to this girl of
            another race. Even in her light chatter, her voice retained the soft, drawling cadence
            implanted there by her Southern birth and training, and which was fast becoming
            irresistible to the half-breed girl.</p>
          <pb n="65" id="VAA3895-063"/>
          <p>&quot;You have been to school at Hampton, have you not?&quot; she questioned,
            wondering at the continued silence of her new companion.</p>
          <p>&quot;Notre Dame,&quot; said Rosebud, laconically.</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Josephine, blankly. &quot;Then you are a
            Romanist?&quot; she added presently, determined to make this girl talk if she sat
            there all day asking questions.</p>
          <p>&quot;I suppose so.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Are you crossing the river to-day ?&quot; ventured Josephine again.
            &quot;Perhaps we had better be starting back,&quot; she suggested, pointing Long
            Chase&apos;s nose homeward.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am going to Velpen,&quot; answered Rosebud, falling into step beside
            Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;Then you must stop at the Broken Key and dine with us,&quot; exclaimed
            Josephine, as the ponies started briskly forward. &quot;I will have dinner ready in
            no time. You will, won&apos;t you? Promise me,&quot; insisted Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;I should like to,&quot; hesitated Rosebud, &quot;but it has been a
            long time since I ate with any of--your people. I am afraid I should not know how to
            act.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I do not believe that,&quot; said Josephine, earnestly.
            &quot;Besides, there are only Jack and I and <pb n="66" id="VAA3895-064"/>we are
            very plain people, I assure you, and live in a very plain manner. Surely you will not
            refuse to dine with us because of our limited capabilities for serving a good meal, will
            you?&quot; she concluded laughingly.</p>
          <p>&quot;I thank you,&quot; said Rosebud, soberly. &quot;I will eat with you
            since you are so good as to ask me. I did not expect to eat at a white man&apos;s
            table again. But Josephine Carroll has--a way, and Onjijitka does not know how to
            refuse.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you like white people ?&quot; asked Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes, I like you--some of you,&quot; said Rosebud, her native reserve
            giving way at last. &quot;But you do not like me. You do not like me as well as you
            like my mother, who is all Dakotah. I went away to Notre Dame because my
            mother&apos;s people did not like me very well and I thought I&apos;d learn to
            be white. I learned--almost. I learned this much and then I had to stop: that I might
            learn to read and write, comb my hair according to the mode, wear abominable stiff
            corset things, sing and dance and play the piano and embroider and--oh, so many, many
            things that are required, you know how many--but that I never could be white. I spent
            four years learn- <pb n="67" id="VAA3895-065"/>ing all this and then I found at the very
            last that you had lied to me--you white people. My blood is mixed, and that, you say, is
            a barrier raised by heaven itself and as irrevocable as death. I beat my heart out until
            it was all bruised and bleeding; with sorrow at first, then with rage, because you had
            lied to me, you know, and then because I would not be a dog of a half-breed, to fawn
            upon the white man,&quot; she said, her voice vibrating with the fierce pride of her
            haughty Sioux forefathers who had been hereditary chiefs, &quot;I came back to my
            people. My father was dead and my mother had married Two Hawks. They accepted me. When I
            was little, my mother called me Onjijitka. All my people call me that now, though at
            school I was known as Rosebud Gireaux. Gireaux was my father&apos;s name. I am all
            Dakotah now.&quot;</p>
          <p>This was not true--this latter statement--and Josephine, with quick sympathy, knew that
            it was not. If she were in truth content to hark back wholly to the Indian ways, why
            then this dress of the pale face and why then this sombre speech with its tang of
            bitterness?</p>
          <p>&quot;Let us be friends, you and me,&quot; said Josephine, as their ponies took
            the homeward stretch <pb n="68" id="VAA3895-066"/>toward the little cabin with its thin
            spiral of smoke climbing idly up into the damp air. The sight sent a queer little home
            thrill through her heart. Strange, when she had thought there was to be no end to the
            longing for the sunny land of her nativity, though Jack was never to know that.
            &quot;This land of yours is so big and lonesome, Rosebud. Shall we be friends
            always?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You are very good. I should like to be friends. When Rosebud visits Miss
            Josephine Carroll at the Broken Key, well and good. I should know what to do. At Notre
            Dame, many took me to be just French--my father was a French Indian trader in the Red
            Lake country, you know--and the good sisters taught me some of their ways. But when Miss
            Josephine Carroll comes to visit at the tepee of Two Hawks, Rosebud will have forgotten
            and what will Miss Josephine Carroll do then?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I do not care where you live,&quot; cried Josephine, impulsively,
            &quot;we are going to be friends, are we not?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Always,&quot; said Rosebud, gravely.</p>
          <p>Dinner was smoking on the table when Jack swung up the path on his crutches, whistling
            a gay measure the while, well content with all the <pb n="69" id="VAA3895-067"/>world
            just then, notwithstanding his tedious convalescence and the fact that he had so
            recently disagreed with his neighbor. Josephine was home and she would have a spanking
            hot dinner all ready. After that there would be a bit of a smoke and a chat, maybe,
            about that time coming when there would be a realization of all their ultra-optimistic
            dreams, and there should be cattle on a thousand hills for John Calhoun and Josephine
            Carroll. So the whistle on his lips was very gay and the content in his handsome eyes
            was very pronounced when he threw open the door of his cabin and sent his new hat--a
            real Stetson this time, he had learned the proper thing in hats since his tenderfoot
            days--spinning across the floor. It was then that he saw Rosebud.</p>
          <p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; he said at once, with ready courtesy.</p>
          <p>&quot;Rosebud, my brother Jack,&quot; said Josephine, placing the steaming
            coffee pot upon the table and looking altogether charming in a gingham apron, her cheeks
            flushed with recent proximity to the stove. &quot;Jack, Miss Rosebud
            Gireaux.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Welcome to the Broken Key,&quot; Miss Gireaux,&quot; said Jack.</p>
          <pb n="70" id="VAA3895-068"/>
          <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Rosebud, simply.</p>
          <p>&quot;Rosebud and I are already the very best of friends,&quot; explained
            Josephine, as they seated themselves around the table with its square of white linen
            which Josephine had brought with her from that far away Southland. &quot;And we are
            going to be together a great deal in the time to come. Now that you are discovered,
            Rosebud, it will not be easy for you to get away from me.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I shall not want to,&quot; said Rosebud, seriously.</p>
          <p>&quot;I should like to know where I come in on this,&quot; spoke up Jack, a
            laugh in his eyes. &quot;You girls seem to be leaving me altogether out of the
            count. I shall not submit to it, I assure you.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, now that I have Rosebud,&quot; scoffed Josephine, &quot;you can
            take care of yourself. Men are dreadfully in the way, are they not,
            Rosebud?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Now, Miss--Rosebud,&quot; remonstrated Jack, &quot;don&apos;t you
            go to siding in with Josephine there. You know you&apos;d like to have me around
            sometimes, now, would n&apos;t you?&quot; he wheedled. &quot;I am a pretty
            good sort of a fellow, really.&quot;</p>
          <p>He was much amused by this play of nonsense. He was much of a boy still, though he was
            seven and twenty. Besides, she was a very pretty girl--there was no getting around that.
            He won- <pb n="71" id="VAA3895-069"/>what she would say. She did not seem like a girl
            who would enter into raillery with the joyous abandon of many girls whom he had known in
            the past.</p>
          <p>&quot;If you are like Josephine,&quot; she replied gravely, &quot;you
            cannot help being good. As for your being in the way, that I cannot answer, because I
            never knew before any one--like you.&quot;</p>
          <p>It was late when Rosebud, returning, crossed the ice again and was slipping noiselessly
            past the ranch of the Broken Key on her way to the tepee of Two Hawks. It was dark, too,
            with that damp, warm, cloudy darkness that comes with the melting of many snows. A
            light, burning steadily, shone through the window. Josephine and Jack were still up
            then. Perhaps Josephine was reading aloud while Jack rested, stretched out upon the
            wolfskin that she had noticed on the floor by the fire, his hands under his head, maybe.
            Or it might be that there was silence between them while each dreamed his dream. She was
            glad now that she had worn her moccasins. She could creep up unheard and unseen and
            satisfy that unexplainable longing which was hers. They would never know and she would
            see again the man whose like she had <pb n="72" id="VAA3895-070"/>never known before.
            She slipped lightly from her saddle and crept forward soundlessly with all the cunning
            stealth of her Sioux ancestry coming to the exultant aid of this their child. Before she
            had half covered the distance she stopped suddenly. It meant that she should have to
            bear for all time the cross of blood. It meant that she could never again know content
            in the lazy, degenerating existence of Two Hawks. As long as she lived now she would
            have to be as white as she could because of--Josephine? Yes, because of Josephine. And
            Jack? Ah, yes, because of Jack--Jack of the courteous speech, the whistling mouth, and
            the laughing eyes. Skulking in the shadows was not what they would do--those two in
            there. She glided back to her pony, mounted, and rode slowly away into the wide and
            lonely night.</p>

          <head>A CHANCE ENCOUNTER AND A RESCUE</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE warm weather continued. The older settlers along the Missouri
            predicted an early break-up of the river. The bluffs were dry and brown and the snow in
            the deep ravines and pockets of the hills was fast disappearing.</p>
          <p>The cattle that had strayed from the Broken Key during the wild storm in which John
            Calhoun Carroll&apos;s leg had been broken had not yet been recovered. But Tom
            Burrington had reported them as running with his own herds, so the young homesteaders
            were resting easy in the friendly assurance. There were only a half-dozen or so of them,
            but it would have been a woful loss at the very beginning of the Carrolls&apos;
            fight for place in the big land so arrogantly resentful of invasion, where the
            littleness of man was seemingly an inexorable law and dogged endurance the one hope of
            the ultimate gaining of a foothold therein.</p>
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you want to ride with me to see Tom?&quot; asked Jack,
            shortly after the visit of the Indian <pb n="74" id="VAA3895-072"/>girl and when he had
            at last obtained Josephine&apos;s permission to ride. &quot;We can find out
            about the fool cattle and make a neighborly call at the same time.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;But Mr. Burrington has not called on us yet,&quot; objected
            Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you ever believe that,&quot; said Jack. &quot;Did he
            not draw up his horse and chat a bit the other day on his way home? That counts west of
            the river, my girl.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I did not see him. He did not ask for me,&quot; said Josephine, still
            loath.</p>
          <p>&quot;He asked about you, however; and besides, where would I be now if it had not
            been for this man Tom Burrington of the Seven-up? You will have to pack away in moth
            balls some of your old-fashioned, conservative prejudices, Josephine,&quot; he
            counselled, wisely. &quot;Or, better still, bury them altogether. I have,&quot;
            he confessed, with a laugh. &quot;Remember always that we are well within the
            borders of cattle land. Besides, I shall be gone the better part of the day and I
            thought it would be lonesome for you here. Come, get on your bonnet. It is a fine day
            for a ride.&quot;</p>
          <p>It was a fine day. There was no mistake about <pb n="75" id="VAA3895-073"/>that. The
            air was like June. From the island came the pound of regular blows of an axe upon fallen
            timber, the rhythmic echoes of which went sounding among the hills. Somewhere within
            that labyrinth of ancient, lofty, gaunt cottonwoods, of runty, spreading cedars, of
            gigantic elms, and of the thick growth of straight, slender ash, their neighbor was
            chopping wood. As they were mounted and ready to start, a man rode into their clearing,
            a young man with much breadth of shoulder and with lazy-looking eyes.</p>
          <p>&quot;Howdy,&quot; said the newcomer, indifferently.</p>
          <p>&quot;Good-morning,&quot; returned Jack. &quot;I thought you went early
            this morning, Henry. You said last night that you expected to be off before
            sun-up.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yep. I reckon I did. But I thought I&apos;d come back and ask you
            something. You see I&apos;m out of a job now.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, what is it?&quot; asked Jack, in a fever to be off.</p>
          <p>&quot;Who did you say lives over to the island now?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;A man by the name of LaDue--Frank LaDue. By the way, you might find work over
              <pb n="76" id="VAA3895-074"/>there. He chops a lot of wood and must need a great deal
            of help. You see how heavily that island is timbered. Besides, I understand that LaDue
            runs the ferry during the Summer. He will certainly need assistance then. It
            won&apos;t do any harm to talk to him, anyway. I thought Tom Burrington was keeping
            your place for you at the Seven-up.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot; &apos;T ain&apos;t much of an island now,&quot; said Henry
            Hoffman, evasively.</p>
          <p>&quot;No, it is n&apos;t, for a fact. But they tell me that during high water a
            considerable stream flows between it and us.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Does he keep any cows?&quot; inquired Henry, meditatively.
            &quot;I&apos;m thinkin&apos; I would n&apos;t be a howlin&apos;
            success topplin&apos; over trees. I&apos;d ruther ride any day. No
            tellin&apos;, though, what we will come to yet, now that the good old days of free
            grass are turnin&apos; up their toes to the daisies. You fellows are responsible for
            that.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you go West, man?&quot; said Jack, a little
            impatiently. Was he never to have done with this quarrel against homesteading?
            &quot;There is free grass in plenty out along the old Black Hills trail. But
            honestly now, my friend,&quot; he argued, with returning good nature, &quot;I
            acknowl- <pb n="77" id="VAA3895-075"/>edge that I am somewhat of a tenderfoot, but are
            you not asking me to believe a lot when you intimate that you are an old-timer? Have you
            voted yet?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot; &apos;T ain&apos;t because I ain&apos;t old enough, if I have
            n&apos;t,&quot; said the other with a laugh. &quot;Besides, as I told your
            sister when I first came here, I&apos;ve been punchin&apos; cows and
            wranglin&apos; horses, young fellow, since I was knee-high-to-a-grasshopper. What
            did you remark about that man LaDue and his critters? Has n&apos;t he ary a
            cow?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I think he has a few. I do not know where he keeps them. You had better go
            and interview him. If you do not come to terms, why, walk right in here and make
            yourself at home before riding on,&quot; said Jack, with ready hospitality.
            &quot;You will find bacon and bread handy, and there is fresh meat in the shed. Just
            help yourself, will you? We have a long ride before us and must be getting
            on.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Say, Mr. Carroll,&quot; advised Henry, &quot;these ain&apos;t the
            good old days I was tellin&apos; you about, you know. Folks mostly lock their doors
            here-abouts. &apos;T ain&apos;t always then they find things like they left
            them. Sometimes there won&apos;t be nothin&apos; there at all but just a vacuum,
            savin&apos; <pb n="78" id="VAA3895-076"/>some sky and air, maybe. Well, so
            long,&quot; he called, riding leisurely islandwards.</p>
          <p>&quot;What an abnormal breadth of shoulder he has,&quot; said Josephine,
            musingly, &quot;and his eyes are as blue and frank as a child&apos;s. Do you
            know, Jack, that is just what he reminds me of--a great, good-natured, overgrown
            baby.&quot;</p>
          <p>Perhaps twenty feet from the shore Tom Burrington had cut a watering place for his
            cattle, and sanded well the ice between so they would not slip. This trough ran parallel
            with the central portion of a large airhole, a mile and a half in length and perhaps
            forty rods in width at its widest place, and a number of feet beyond the ice ditch. The
            current where the river was open had a curious rotary movement. Tom was riding to the
            corral to release the cattle therein waiting to be driven to water, when Jack and
            Josephine rode into view. He swept his wide hat from his head and rode quickly
            forward.</p>
          <p>&quot;You do not know how glad I am that you have come,&quot; he said, with a
            certain grave emphasis. Glancing at Josephine, he could not help wondering how it was
            that a woman so altogether sweet and good to look upon had chanced to stray to these
            outer boundaries of the earth.</p>
          <pb n="79" id="VAA3895-077"/>
          <p>&quot;We are seekers,&quot; explained Jack. &quot;You have not been
            rustling any Broken Key cattle, have you, Tom? I am told of a surety that some are mixed
            up in your herds. Explanations are in order, and I hope for the sake of our friendship
            that this little affair may be satisfactorily adjusted,&quot; he concluded,
            whimsically.</p>
          <p>Tom laughed; then he held his hands to his lips and sent forth a resonant hail that
            awoke the echoes in the surrounding hills.</p>
          <p>&quot;Forgive me, Miss Carroll,&quot; he apologized, &quot;but that boy,
            Charlie, is around somewhere and I want him. I lost a valuable man this
            morning,&quot; he continued, turning to Jack.</p>
          <p>&quot;Henry Hoffman came back a while ago and told me that you no longer needed
            him,&quot; said Jack, &quot;and that he guessed he&apos;d &apos;be
            a-movin&apos; on.&apos; &quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;He had not been with me long, but he was as good a cowman as I ever knew. He
            came to this country from Texas a year or two ago. He is a reckless sort of a fellow,
            but I liked him. I do not know why he left me. He gave no excuse; simply said, when I
            paid him off this morning, that he guessed he &apos;d &apos;be a-movin&apos;
            on.&apos; &quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I referred him to our neighbor, LaDue. He was looking for a
            job.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="80" id="VAA3895-078"/>
          <p>&quot;Good Lord!&quot; ejaculated the cowboy, Charlie Moore, riding into the
            little circle. &quot;Henry Hoffman chop wood? Not muchy! I&apos;d plumb love to
            see him do it!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, he is gone, so it does not matter what he does or where he
            goes,&quot; said Tom. &quot;But I was sorry to lose him. Ride to the home range,
            Charlie, and cut out any Broken Key cattle that may be there. You reported some strays
            on that pasture, did you not? You had better take some one with you. Drive the bunch
            here.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I will go with him,&quot; volunteered Jack, &quot;if I may leave
            Josephine behind.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;By all means,&quot; agreed Tom promptly.</p>
          <p>&quot;If you will keep on with your work,&quot; qualified Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;It is agreed. I have a hundred head of cattle here which I am bound to
            deliver to the Lower Brule Indians, in prime condition. The drive begins at two
            o&apos;clock this afternoon. I have the government contract, as perhaps you know, so
            I have this to do every month. If you really do not mind, I will just finish this little
            chore now.&quot;</p>
          <p>Jack and Charlie rode away. Josephine watched the work of the big ranchman interest-
              <pb n="81" id="VAA3895-079"/>edly, sitting quietly on Long Chase, looking fair and
            sweet and lovable with the fresh wind blowing loosened tendrils of shining hair about
            her face, the crimson at her throat making a spot of color in vivid contrast to the dun
            hues of the hills and the lines of gray timber belting the ravines on the opposite side
            of the river.</p>
          <p>Together with most of the cattlemen of the sterner mould, those who had endured and who
            now, weather-toughened, hardship-proof, battle-scarred veterans of the wilderness,
            looking back upon their colossal struggle, were slow to accord to rawer recruits the
            strength of purpose with which they themselves had been endowed, and counted all
            tenderfeet weaklings until proved otherwise. Burrington believed that young Carroll and
            his sister would flit away soon, and that the wide plains and the solemn hills would
            know them no more. Not that Carroll was not brave-hearted and lofty-spirited; but the
            bravest hearts may be broken by loneliness, and the loftiest spirits sink the lowest
            when encompassed by unresponsiveness.</p>
          <p>Besides, there had never been a girl like Josephine west of the river--never; and
            because there never had been, he was afraid to look for <pb n="82" id="VAA3895-080"/>her
            face on the canvas of the future for fear that it would have been blotted out. If only
            she could be kept until his mother came; that might help to hold her always. But he
            could not ask his mother to come to him until the harshness of early Spring was well
            over, not even--and besides, how could he ask her to come now, any way, just because an
            unusually sweet girl had settled in the neighborhood? The absurdity of it all sent a
            laugh to his lips as, still mounted, he opened the gate of the huge corral and drove the
            herd down toward the river. He wore no coat or waist-coat, his heavy blue flannel shirt
            being all-sufficient for his vigorous and healthy manhood. The soft ends of the white
            neckerchief knotted around his brown throat fluttered gayly in the light wind.</p>
          <p>Separating about ten of the cattle from the main herd, Tom drove them onto the
            well-sanded ice. Josephine rode closer. She had heard Jack say that cattle seldom
            stepped on ice unless under compulsion, as they had an inherent fear of it. She was
            somewhat surprised, therefore, to observe that part of the herd left on shore began to
            disintegrate and to move forward. The cattle were very dry and Tom was alone. In spite
            of <pb n="83" id="VAA3895-081"/>him, at least thirty impatient, thirsty steers crowded
            down to drink. Immediately the ice, softened by the long spell of melting weather, began
            to sink, and the water came up through the cut places and spread over the ice. Leaping
            from his horse, Tom quickly skirted the cattle, and from the channel side began driving
            them shoreward. This left the remaining herd master-less, and the whole foolish, thirsty
            bunch pressed forward to the sanded ice. It was a critical moment. The water already lay
            six inches deep over the ice. And now it seemed to Josephine that there was only one
            thing for her to do. She could not sit still and let all those poor creatures drown
            before her eyes. She must help Tom. Slipping from her saddle, she ran swiftly around the
            now terrified herd and began pressing the cattle back to the shore.</p>
          <p>&quot;My God, Josephine!&quot; cried Tom, not knowing that he called her so,
            his brown cheeks paling with sudden apprehension. &quot;You will be trampled to
            death! Keep back!&quot;</p>
          <p>At that moment the shore ice gave way. There was grave danger then for Tom and
            Josephine as well as for the cattle. But an indomitable soul was Tom&apos;s. Still
            pushing the cattle <pb n="84" id="VAA3895-082"/>forward, he ran toward Josephine on the
            farther side. Too late! The ice had broken at last from the shore to the treacherous,
            boiling airhole, and all that mass of rotten ice between became a heaving, floating
            death trap. Many cattle had already scrambled in safety to the bank. Many were breaking
            in, and yet others slid into the water, unable to maintain a balance on the tippy blocks
            that broke off from the main strip. Most of these fortunate ones swam readily to shore;
            but of those which broke off on the farther side, many kept their footing and went
            floating down the narrow channel, their unsteady support knocking against the thin ice
            on the far side of the airhole. When these finally struck the solid ice below, they
            dived suddenly under, drawn by the terrible suction, and the luckless creatures thus
            unexpectedly brushed into the water had not room nor time to resist, and many a fine
            beef, signed with the sign of the opulent Seven-up, was thus drawn into the yawning,
            cruel trap of death.</p>
          <p>It was well for Josephine, that day, that quickness in thought and unhesitancy in
            action were Tom&apos;s by right of birth as well as by the years of training in the
            struggle for the subjugation <pb n="85" id="VAA3895-083"/>of the arrogant cattle
            country. He was bounding to Josephine to force her out of the reach of danger when the
            crash came. And then it was that Josephine found herself unanchored on a jagged-edged
            piece of ice that tottered beneath the weight of herself and two lusty steers; but these
            two poor creatures slipped immediately into the seething water, so that her frail bark
            rode steadily and began its slow, stately, heart-clutching journey down the channel.
            Then this is what he did, that man of the plains. There might have been other ways of
            saving Josephine; perhaps none so sure, because it was his incomparable strength that
            made it possible. Afterwards it came to him that he might have let her drift, as the
            foolish cattle had drifted, to the solid ice below, and then called to her to jump
            before her block went under; but there might have been a mis-step, and there was no
            power on earth that could have saved her had her spring fallen short. Just a moment he
            stood, strong, reliant, weighing the chances. A swift, unformed thought of commendation
            flashed through his mind and then hid in his heart to find expression in another time.
            Josephine had not screamed nor made one rash or hysterical <pb n="86" id="VAA3895-084"
            />movement. White-cheeked and quiet, she awaited his lead.</p>
          <p>&quot;Do not move!&quot; he called to her, and ran swiftly to the shore,
            leaping the chasm where a dark flood pushed and eddied between. It would have been a
            long jump, even on an athletic field with the advantage of a run and without the hazard
            of teetering ice for the weight of his spring. As it was, he fell foul of the bank and
            went waist deep into the slacker water close in shore. He scrambled out, sprang up the
            bank, snatched his rope from his saddle horn, ran down the river, and out onto the
            unbroken ice below the ugly break-up.</p>
          <p>Josephine was drawing perilously near the danger line when he roped her--roped her as
            he had roped hundreds of creatures of the range. Tom Burrington had not been one to stay
            in the cities while the stirring man&apos;s work of the ranch was left to others,
            who in turn would reap the high reward of a true sight, a steady nerve, and a strong
            arm. No cow-puncher on the Seven-up could throw a better rope than its master. The noose
            settled swiftly under Josephine&apos;s arms; there was a quick, sharp jerk, and he
            drew her <pb n="87" id="VAA3895-085"/>to him, out of the death trap, safe, but bruised
            by her crumpled flight over the ice, and shocked into momentary unconsciousness by the
            sudden contact with the cold water.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
          <head>AT THE RANCH HOUSE OF THE SEVEN-UP</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>OM came in.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am very sorry,&quot; said Josephine, earnestly. &quot;I wanted to
            be a help instead of a hindrance. I am very sorry.&quot;</p>
          <p>She was sitting in a rocking-chair on a huge gray wolfskin close to the fire in the big
            living-room of the ranch house of the Seven-up. Tom, unaccountably embarrassed and
            fearful moreover of her taking cold as a result of her recent plunge, stirred the fire
            vigorously until it roared and crackled, and then stood near in order to feed it, which
            he did almost constantly from a supply of driftwood heaped high in a box behind the
            stove. Josephine had removed her dripping outer garments and was well wrapped in a
            gayly colored Indian blanket which her host had left for her. Her small stockinged feet
            were propped upon the fender, her shoes standing near by to dry. The pretty color was
            returning to her cheeks. In the kitchen Tom&apos;s cook was plainly visible, moving
            briskly about preparing a meal of might <pb n="89" id="VAA3895-087"/>for the
            Boss&apos;s tony, unexpected, but altogether welcome guests. Given an incentive, he
            really was a famous cook, and what better incentive than a girl--and such a girl--a girl
            so late from civilization that her notions were doubtless even yet colored with the
            pampered fancies of that far-away, mistaken people. He would show her once and for all
            what real cookery was. So he sang, as he mixed his biscuit dough, a song of sacred
            words, but profane melody--profane because he had a long time ago forgotten the meaning
            of what he sang.</p>
          <p>&quot;Are you sure that you are warm enough?&quot; demanded Tom,
            irrelevantly.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am as warm as toast,&quot; said Josephine. &quot;You have made
            such a splendid fire, I shall be dry in no time. You are so--good. How can I ever--you
            were so quick and so strong.&quot;</p>
          <p>Someway, it was hard to say anything properly to this man. She had never before found
            any trouble in expressing herself easily and to the point. It annoyed her. If he would
            only sit down! He stood there looking down at her gravely, and he seemed very big and
            handsome while she herself felt chagrined, humbled, forlorn, and decidedly at a
            disadvantage with that <pb n="90" id="VAA3895-088"/>ridiculous blanket, her wild hair,
            and dilapidated appearance generally. It was n&apos;t fair.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am glad I was in time,&quot; he said, simply. &quot;But I was sorry
            that I had to throw so soon. I think if I had had time to get nearer I might have saved
            you from a wetting.&quot;</p>
          <p>Her vexation of the moment vanished immediately. She held out her hand impulsively, and
            as he held it for rather a long moment he did not think once of the dishevelled hair or
            of the bizarre effect of the gay blanket. What he did think was this: That the west
            country would be a very lonely country when this brown-eyed, sweet-voiced Josephine
            Carroll went away from it forever. Something came to him then--something that brought a
            hint of color into the bronzed face and a light into the gray eyes. He threw back his
            handsome head and laughed a little under his breath. He would do it--if he could.</p>
          <p>&quot;What did the wetting matter? What did anything matter?&quot; said
            Josephine, gratefully. &quot;Only that in a moment I should have been--it would have
            been too late--but in that moment you were there and now I am here safe and warm by the
            fire--it would be so dark under the ice and cold and--the water is running so
            fast.&quot; <pb n="91" id="VAA3895-089"/>She shuddered and was silent, the full
            horror of it all creeping over her for the first time since her rescue.</p>
          <p>&quot;You must not think of that,&quot; said Tom, quietly. &quot;There was
            n&apos;t the slightest danger. I knew that I should be in time and I also knew that
            I should not miss. Why, Miss Carroll,&quot; he went on, lightly, &quot;I want
            you to know that I know how to throw a rope. If you will just remember that one little
            fact, you will not be afraid the next time you go for a sail down Old Muddy on an ice
            boat.&quot;</p>
          <p>Josephine smiled tremulously; then she asked soberly: &quot;And the poor
            cattle--did many drown? Oh, the poor things!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Not many in proportion. The boys are filling out the required number now. Do
            not grieve about--them,&quot; he added, in a low voice.</p>
          <p>At that moment a shrill cattle call was heard from without, and with the words,
            &quot;That is Charlie, and judging from the racket, the boys have found the strays
            all right,&quot; Tom left the room.</p>
          <p>It was a meal of might, to be sure. They ate in the same big room where Josephine had
            sat by the fire. She had put on her own clothes <pb n="92" id="VAA3895-090"/>again, but
            still felt a little wrinkled and &quot;trembly.&quot; She tried hard, however,
            to keep her mind off the rushing water, and the men never spoke of it after the affair
            had been explained to Jack. His answer to Tom had been a strong, silent handclasp. There
            were half a dozen cowboys seated around the long tables besides Tom, Josephine, and
            Jack. It was an interesting room. Josephine was frankly curious about it and its
            furnishings. It was very plain to be seen that a woman had been there--that it had not
            always been inhabited by a careless set of bachelor cow-men alone. That rocking-chair,
            for instance, was of fine wicker, self-evidently a woman&apos;s chair. There were
            several flower pots on the south window sills, although any plant there might once have
            been was now but a dead and desolate stalk.</p>
          <p>&quot;We forgot to water them,&quot; explained Tom, with a laugh, when he saw
            Josephine&apos;s eyes resting upon these pathetic reminders of his carelessness.
            &quot;I promised my mother that I would take care of them--and so did Charlie here.
            You need not grin so cheerfully, my boy, you know that you are as deeply involved in
            this affair as I am. My mother loves flowers, Miss Car <pb n="93" id="VAA3895-091"
            />roll, and more than that, I imagine that she thinks the boys need some refining
            influence about them. Not I, of course, but the boys. We are an ornery lot, I suspect.
            Anyway, she cunningly tries to enlighten our souls to a proper appreciation of the
            beautiful. I promised her when she went away that I would take care of her posies, but I
            forgot, and Charlie forgot; so they died.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;While you are about it you might as well tell why we&apos;re
            eatin&apos; canned beans for dinner, too, stid o&apos; spuds and
            ingerns,&quot; spoke up Charlie Moore, casually. He was busily engaged upon the
            consumption of a generous share of the beans in question, as he spoke.</p>
          <p>&quot;Please do,&quot; said Josephine, smiling.</p>
          <p>&quot;They froze.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh! And how did it happen?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Will you not spare me the harrowing recital?&quot; begged Tom, in joyous
            badinage.</p>
          <p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; insisted Josephine, gleefully.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Tom, ruefully, &quot;if I must, I must, I suppose.
            It was this way. You see I have a little brother. His name is Louis and he is eleven, I
            believe, and somewhat of a farmer, with mother putting him <pb n="94" id="VAA3895-092"
            />up to it all the time. Louis had a garden down there on the bottom last Summer. The
            boys liked him and they all helped. We had fine watermelons in August, and good things
            all Summer long. Whet he went away, he left explicit instructions as to just when we
            must dig up the late potatoes and the onions; but we kind of forgot, and one morning the
            ground was frozen through a foot or more. It was a sad farewell, and this has been a
            long and dreary winter, potatoless and onionless.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;What shocking shiftlessness,&quot; laughed Josephine, merrily;
            &quot;but you have suffered for it.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Indeed, we have,&quot; responded Tom, soberly. &quot;Do you know, I
            hated like the deuce--Miss Carroll, forgive me, I forgot--to own up to the little chap
            that I had forgotten to take care of his garden. He did so want the boys to have
            something good to eat during the long, monotonous Winter. Yes, that is the
            child&apos;s shelf there in the corner. He cannot always be carrying all of his
            things to and from Chicago, so he leaves part of them here. He persuaded one of the boys
            to put up that shelf in the living-room because he said it seemed a shame to lock up his
            treasures in his own room when &apos;You fellows <pb n="95" id="VAA3895-093"/>might
            as well be getting the good of &apos;em.&apos; It is a strange jumble of school
            books and boy stories, marbles and baseball paraphernalia, which he brought with him,
            and odd stones, snake skins, wolf teeth, coyote skins, bits of mica and horns of defunct
            cattle, which he has gathered together here--and some of the things the Indians have
            given him. Most of those he took back with him to the city, however; things like the war
            bonnet, the moccasins, the medicine pouch, the barbed arrows, and the shield. They would
            make a vast impression on his mates, you will very readily understand. Yes, that is his
            own rifle. I am teaching him to use it. Poor chap! How he longed to take that with him
            to show the fellows, although he knew that he could never use it there. But the mother
            said, &apos;No.&apos; &quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;And yet you could disappoint a child like that and forget his
            garden,&quot; said Josephine, reproachfully.</p>
          <p>&quot;It was a shame, was n&apos;t it? But his revenge is at hand. We shall all
            have to reform and learn to farm whether we like it or not. It will soon be a question
            of our butter and bread. You homesteaders have invaded the land at last. I confess that
            I have always been surprised that you have <pb n="96" id="VAA3895-094"/>not done so
            before; but you have sounded the doom of the cattlemen all right. We shall either be
            compelled to turn grangers or else be &apos;a-movin&apos; on,&apos; as Henry
            said this morning.&quot;</p>
          <p>Again the old question!</p>
          <p>&quot;One would think,&quot; interposed Jack, jestingly earnest, &quot;that
            Josephine and I were not only monsters of iniquity, but a multitude of monsters--all
            hydra-headed. Now, Josephine and I are only two people and Josephine has but one head
            and I have but one. I pledge you my word of honor that this is true according to my own
            best belief and judgment.&quot;</p>
          <p>They all laughed heartily, but Tom soon became grave.</p>
          <p>&quot;You are not the only ones,&quot; he said. &quot;It is the beginning
            of the end. Carroll, do you intend to abide by your holding, no matter what the
            consequences may be, and in spite of hardships, discouragements, drought, and
            loneliness?&quot;</p>
          <p>He looked at the younger man keenly a moment. He wanted to know the make of Jack
            because upon him depended many things, chief of which was the question of the staying or
            going of Josephine.</p>
          <pb n="97" id="VAA3895-095"/>
          <p>&quot;I do so intend,&quot; replied Jack, steadily. &quot;Through good or
            evil report--through prosperity or poverty--through happiness or sorrow--through
            trouble, pain, or death. All I ask is to be let alone. I had better be let alone. If I
            am not, there will be trouble--for some one.&quot;</p>

          <head>ONJIJITKA MAKES A DISCOVERY</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE river did break up early, the Spring was beautiful, and May time
            was Summer time in the cattle country. The hills were spotted far and wide with bunches
            of that uncompromisingly stiff plant with its many spear-shaped leaves, which the
            natives call soap-weed. Undulating barriers made of the broad-leaved, prickly cactus
            that runs along the ground sprang up everywhere. Josephine had worn her heavy leathern
            leggings in the Winter for warmth. She continued to wear them now with thick-soled shoes
            as a protection against surprise from some torpid rattler which might any day now be
            coming out to stretch himself after his long sleep, and to bask in the warm sun of this
            early Summer. A colony of prairie dogs had settled a short distance northwest of the
            Broken Key, and the little fellows chattered and squealed and dived in and out of their
            underground homes all the live-long day. Slabs of mica, oftentimes in layers as thin and
            smooth as if sliced with a knife, glinted from the <pb n="99" id="VAA3895-097"/>cut
            bluffs opposite, or, catching the sun, glittered on the narrow slate gravel below where
            they had slid from some upper stratum. The cedars in the gap and in the gulches had
            changed their rusty brown to a cleaner, richer green. The wild, stormy winds of Spring
            had settled down into the steady monotones of Summer breezes which went whispering
            through the grass and talked in mysteries to the tree-tops. Under the spell of it all,
            the ceaseless winds, the immutable hills, the solemn solitude, the haughty rush of the
            big yellow river to join the southern sea, Josephine forgot the longing for the land of
            her fathers which had stalked beside her all through the dreary Winter months, and the
            home of the South became a sweet haunting memory of something that had passed away
            forever.</p>
          <p>On one of these May afternoons when the wind blew strongly over the high table lands
            and grieved in the gulches, Onjijitka, returning from Velpen, rode down through the gap
            and sent a shrill, penetrating, but sweet halloo into the face of the wind across the
            white-capped water. Then, slipping from her pony, she stood leaning against him,
            motionless, waiting. Presently a boat pushed out from the island and began its <pb
              n="100" id="VAA3895-098"/>wavering, uncertain course towards her. It was a huge,
            ungainly looking object not unlike a crudely built row-boat, except for its unusual
            size. There was one large oar near the front requiring the rigid attention and constant
            labor of two men, not so much to propel as to keep the boat at the proper angle with the
            current, the current forcing it forward somewhat in the manner in which the wind forces
            a sailboat when the boat is riding at right angles with it. When with a soft, sliding
            sound, the ferry grounded on the yielding sand of the near shore, one of the men sprang
            out and secured it by throwing the noose of a heavy rope over a stake driven into the
            earth, some little distance up the road. Then the second man stepped slouchily
            ashore.</p>
          <p>&quot;So it&apos;s you, Rosebud,&quot; said the latter, gnawing off a piece
            of villainous-looking plug tobacco as he spoke. &quot;You could n&apos;t have
            waited, I suppose, until this cursed wind went down?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;No, I could n&apos;t,&quot; said Rosebud, calmly, leading her pony to
            the water&apos;s edge.</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, you could n&apos;t, could n&apos;t you?&quot; retorted LaDue,
            his ready anger rising to meet the cool insolence of the tone. &quot;Well, young
            lady, the chances are pretty much in favor of you waitin&apos;, <pb n="101"
              id="VAA3895-099"/>whether it suits you or not. Just don&apos;t you cast off yet,
            Henry. Wind &apos;s too blamed strong for this here boat to push against.
            We&apos;ll just wait a while, if you don&apos;t mind.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t mind in the least,&quot; said Rosebud, indifferently.
            &quot;Now that you have come, I should n&apos;t care if we remained here until
            moon-up, for that matter.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Supposin&apos; Henry and I should scoot back with the boat, not
            hankerin&apos; perticlar to over-load &apos;er with you and your critter, what
            would you do then, eh?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I should shoot the old tub full of holes so that she would sink with
            you,&quot; responded Rosebud, composedly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Do you carry a gun, girl?&quot; asked LaDue, curiously. &quot;I
            don&apos;t see none.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Put me to the test and then you will know,&quot; said Rosebud,
            quietly.</p>
          <p>&quot;The girl&apos;s got the drop on you, LaDue,&quot; called Henry
            Hoffman, good-naturedly, from the stake. &quot;Quit your foolin&apos; and git
            that there cayuse into the boat if you&apos;re kakilatin&apos; on any
            he&apos;p from me.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;That&apos;s what you get by caterin&apos; to a she-Injun,&quot;
            said LaDue, grumblingly.</p>
          <pb n="102" id="VAA3895-100"/>
          <p>&quot;I think, perhaps, you had better not call me that any more,&quot; said
            Rosebud, softly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Call you what?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot; &apos;She-Injun.&apos; You had better not, I think.&quot;</p>
          <p>Her voice was low, emotionless. Her soft dark eyes were not upon him at all but were
            fixed dreamily upon the long, green timber line of the mainland opposite. It looked
            farther away than it really was, somehow, with the wind blowing from it and the
            whitecaps riding between. LaDue laughed loudly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, God A&apos;mighty, girl,&quot; he cried, &quot;but
            you&apos;re puttin&apos; on a lot o&apos; airs, now, ain&apos;t you?
            What &apos;s come over you all o&apos; a sudden? Tell me that, now, and then
            we&apos;ll go. I ain&apos;t got no intentions o&apos; campin&apos; out
            here all Summer, if you have. What&apos;s come over you, Rosebud? You ain&apos;t
            contemplatin&apos; leavin&apos; your relations again, are you?&quot; He
            glanced at her keenly from suddenly narrowed eyes.</p>
          <p>&quot;Never mind about that,&quot; said Rosebud, almost listlessly.
            &quot;But you had better remember what I said about calling names.&quot;</p>
          <p>Leading her pony, she stepped into the boat where, there being no deck, the gritty
            little fellow was compelled to stand, steadying himself on the <pb n="103"
              id="VAA3895-101"/>narrow flat bottom. The horse disposed of to her satisfaction, she
            turned her back upon the men, nor would she be drawn into further conversation. At a
            sign from LaDue, Henry cast off, both men sprang on board, and the rude little ferry
            began its slow, tortuous way back against the wind. Without a doubt it would drift below
            its original moorings. Rosebud, unafraid, dreamed day-dreams. The men plied the big oar
            untiringly, Henry Hoffman interestedly. He had never seen anything just like it until he
            had hired out to Frank LaDue for a season&apos;s chopping of wood. There was nothing
            to be heard but the sweep of the Summer wind over the boat and the swish of the tawny
            water slapping against the rough planking.</p>
          <p>Presently the men began talking in a desultory fashion. Their voices were not distinct
            but Rosebud was not interested. She did not like LaDue and she felt no curiosity
            concerning the new man on the island. Men came and went there, giving place to a new man
            so quickly that it was scarcely worth while to be curious about them. A man would drift
            one day to the island. No one knew whence he came. No one asked. He would cut wood for a
            while, haul it some- <pb n="104" id="VAA3895-102"/>times to ranchmen off the river front
            who had no timber, thus identifying himself for the time being with the interests of the
            owner of the island. After a while he would not be there any more. There would be a new
            man doing the same old things. What was the use of being curious? So Rosebud did not
            listen.</p>
          <p>It was not long, however, before a little hissing sound was borne to her ears, a sound
            akin to the warning of a rattle-snake. It was not a rattle-snake&apos;s warning, and
            Rosebud never for one moment thought that it was. She knew perfectly well what it was,
            and it was because she knew so well that she seemed not to hear at all. She continued
            staring idly across the turbulent water. Her Indian blood helped her. And yet what she
            had heard was only a faint &quot;Sh-she--h--h--,&quot; half whispered by one of
            the men. There is nothing so penetrating as a sibilant whisper. It is very probable that
            had not that hissing caution been given, she would have comprehended nothing of the
            low-toned conversation; but now that something was being said that she must not hear,
            she would hear--if she had to stifle her own breath which hindered her. They were not
            saying much--a word now and then--she could <pb n="105" id="VAA3895-103"/>not hear--what
            was that--&quot;the kid&apos;s critter--swim &apos;er across--this
            evening--pocket--&quot;</p>
          <p>Rosebud rode slowly and unconcernedly across the island and stopped at the Broken
            Key.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am going to stay for supper, Josephine,&quot; she announced,
            calmly.</p>
          <p>Jack was not at home.</p>
          <p>&quot;It is strange that you did not meet him,&quot; said Josephine.
            &quot;He went to town right after dinner. We are sadly in need of help, Rosebud.
            Why, bless you, I have turned herd boy. Did n&apos;t you know that ? I take care of
            the cattle while Jack farms. The house just takes care of itself. It looks dreadful, I
            know. But what is a body going to do when she has fifty poor creatures to minister unto?
            I cannot let them starve. I wish we had kept that baby-eyed cowboy who works for our
            neighbor. But we did not realize when we let him go in March how much extra work the
            farming would make. He said that he would rather take care of cattle than chop wood.
            Still, I notice that he is everlastingly at it--chopping wood, I mean. It is strange
            that you did not meet Jack, Rosebud.&quot;</p>
          <p>An inscrutable smile came into Rosebud&apos;s dark eyes. She had not met Jack but
            she had seen <pb n="106" id="VAA3895-104"/>him. She had not met him
            because--well--because--and he had not seen her because she had not meant that he should
            see her. She thought to herself, a little sadly, that Josephine need not be troubled
            about her home. In Rosebud&apos;s eyes, it looked neat and sweet and home-like.
            Bowls of wood violets stood on the rude table. White Swiss curtains hung at the windows.
            It was true that books, papers, and magazines were strewn rather carelessly about, but
            what did it matter? The room looked like Josephine and it looked like--Jack.</p>
          <p>When Rosebud was gone, Josephine sat down on the door step to wait for Jack. The wind
            had fallen away. It was very still. The sun went down and a coolness crept in its wake.
            There was a thick growth of willows between her and the river but it seemed to her that
            she could feel it rushing southward. She wished that Jack would come. The evening was
            such a lonesome time when he was away. She was afraid that she might get to
            thinking--thinking of a better day for them, when Jack was never long gone and when she
            never had to be alone. The evenings here in the valley were so still. It was getting
            dark. There would be a moon, though, so she <pb n="107" id="VAA3895-105"/>should not be
            afraid. She wondered what they were doing on the island. They were not cutting late
            to-night. From far away came faintly the sound of a coyote&apos;s shrill bark, then
            another and another, mellowed by distance. The far-away yelping continued, making the
            near stillness stiller and the lonesomeness more lonesome. A big timber wolf was visible
            for a moment skulking along the sky line of the western hills--then it, too, was gone.
            An owl hooted, and at that moment Rosebud came back. She was on foot and she glided
            noiselessly around the house like a phantom of the lonely night.</p>
          <p>&quot;Josephine,&quot; she whispered, holding out her hand, &quot;come with
            me and quickly!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;What--where-&quot; began Josephine, startled and bewildered. She arose
            and grasped Rosebud&apos;s hand, chilled with sudden apprehension and glad, glad, of
            the friendly human touch.</p>
          <p>&quot;Do not be afraid--just come with me and quickly. I did not go home--I
            followed them. That man LaDue is a--devil, Josephine.&quot; She was dragging
            Josephine toward the dark blur of the island forest while these breathless words came in
            choking undertones from her lips. &quot;He will run in Indian calves from the
            Reserva- <pb n="108" id="VAA3895-106"/>tion, will he? Let him watch out. Now and from
            henceforth I, Onjijitka, am camping on his trail. You know that he does that,
            don&apos;t you, Josephine--runs in our calves and hides them here on the island
            until he can dispose of them? He has not yet been caught in the act but we know--Two
            Hawks knows and Bear Heart--let him beware of Bear Heart--Bear Heart never forgets and
            his hate is relentless and his vengeance sure. The agent knows, I think. They know it at
            the Seven-up. Many know it who are afraid. Afraid, Josephine, do you hear? But Onjijitka
            is not afraid. Let him look out. Josephine, have you lost a cow?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered Josephine, starting nervously away from a fallen
            tree trunk.</p>
          <p>&quot;You must not be afraid,&quot; said Rosebud, reassuringly. &quot;They
            are both at the river by this time. There is no one else on the island. You are sure
            about the heifer?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; assented Josephine, trying desperately to control the numb
            terror that was creeping over her. &quot;She has been missing for two
            days.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Would you know the stray?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes. She is the cow we always milked.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;We must not talk any more now,&quot; said Rose- <pb n="109"
              id="VAA3895-107"/>bud, in a low voice. &quot;Do not say a word. Just follow
            me.&quot;</p>
          <p>They turned aside from the dim wagon trail into the dark woods to the north. There was
            no light in the cabin but they gave it a wide berth, nevertheless, and were soon safely
            lost in the labyrinth of the forest. Presently, they turned eastward and crept
            noiselessly forward until they came to the end of the timber. There they halted. If they
            remained quiet there was little danger of discovery. The shadows were very deep. The
            moon, riding up from the eastern hills, served only to make them the denser by contrast.
            The usually murky water gleamed silver in the white radiance. The river was low and a
            sandy beach stretched between the timber line and the water&apos;s edge where a
            skiff swung lightly at its moorings. There was no sign of man or beast in all the
            peaceful scene. They had not long to wait. Very soon, two men and a cow emerged from out
            the gloom of the forest so close to them that Josephine with difficulty refrained from
            gasping aloud in sheer nervous dread, and walked leisurely across the sandbar. Josephine
            pressed Rosebud&apos;s hand convulsively and Rosebud understood. The men were
            plainly <pb n="110" id="VAA3895-108"/>visible--their identity easily determined. They
            approached the boat wordlessly. They were not afraid. This was a very lonely spot. They
            were silent merely because there was no necessity for speech. They understood one
            another so absolutely--Frank LaDue and his woodchopper. They stepped into the boat and
            pushed off, but the cow evinced signs of stubbornness, planted her feet firmly in the
            sand and refused to be dragged into the water, so that the leading rope became taut and
            strained, all to no purpose. Immediately, the men broke forth into profanity which had
            no effect, seemingly, upon the cow. The controversy between man and brute was finally
            adjusted, to the satisfaction of the men at least, by Henry Hoffman&apos;s jumping
            from the boat and shoving the animal into the river, using an oar for a club. Then he
            himself ran into the water, climbed into the rapidly receding skiff, and the two men
            rowed across the moonlit water and into the heavy shadows beyond, the cow swimming
            gallantly in their wake.</p>
          <p>&quot;And he said, Josephine,&quot; whispered Rosebud, as the girls made their
            way homeward, back through the dark, island forest--there was no need of whispering now,
            but it went with the <pb n="111" id="VAA3895-109"/>eerie errand upon which they had been
            bent--&quot;he said--I followed them, you know--ah! he little dreamed that the
            &apos;she-Injun&apos; was so near. He had better not call me names any more,
            Josephine, and he had better, far better, stay off the Indian lands.&quot; Her voice
            was low and hissing, but beautiful still. It would always be beautiful. She had
            forgotten what she meant to say. They came out into the dim trail where the moonlight
            filtered through the foliage overhead; then she remembered. &quot;He said,
            Josephine, &apos;I&apos;ll get every critter Carroll owns if he does
            n&apos;t get out o&apos; here mighty damned quick!&apos; &quot;</p>
          <p>With a sinking heart, Josephine recalled Jack&apos;s words the day at the Seven-up.
            &quot;All I ask is to be let alone,&quot; he had said. &quot;I had better be
            let alone. If I am not, there will be trouble for some one.&quot;</p>

          <head>CARROLL CALLS ON HIS NEIGHBOR</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">I</hi>T was late when Jack came home. He found Josephine and Rosebud still
            sitting on the door step. Rosebud arose at once.</p>
          <p>&quot;Josephine and I will ride home with you,&quot; said Jack.
            &quot;Indeed you shall not,&quot; returned Rosebud, resolutely. &quot;It is
            too far. I stayed with Josephine because--she will tell you why. I am going home
            alone.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Rosebud, stay all night,&quot; urged Josephine. &quot;It is so
            late.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;The night is not bad to me,&quot; answered Rosebud. &quot;You must
            not forget that every turn of the old trail, every bunch of soapweed by the wayside, is
            known to Onjijitka. Night or day, it is all the same. Good-night.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Onjijitka,&quot; said Jack, with whimsical reproach and with a gallant
            and reckless disregard of the many miles that lay between the Broken Key and the
            outlying hut on the Reservation--he had a little way of hesitating for a barely per- <pb
              n="113" id="VAA3895-111"/>ceptible moment before pronouncing her name in the slow,
            lovable voice that was becoming so dangerously sweet to the step-daughter of Two
            Hawks--&quot;do you mean to say that you are not going to let me ride home with
            you?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Onjijitka has said. Good-night.&quot; She glided into the shadows and was
            gone.</p>
          <p>&quot;Heigho!&quot; yawned Jack, throwing himself down upon the spot where
            Rosebud had been sitting. &quot;I&apos;m tired, Jo, dead tired.&quot; It was
            true. His face showed pale and tired in the moonlight. &quot;I think perhaps I have
            found some one to help us after a while--in a few days--but it was hard, tremendously
            hard. I think the Broken Key is out of favor, Josephine. Heigho, but I am
            tired!&quot; He clasped his hands behind his head and rested so, leaning against the
            door casing, his brown eyes staring thoughtfully into the shadows. &quot;What a
            pretty girl Onjijitka is,&quot; he said dreamily.</p>
          <p>&quot;She is indeed,&quot; assented Josephine, quietly. &quot;Jack, I have
            something to tell you.&quot;</p>
          <p>Early the next morning Jack sauntered over to the island. Because the river was low, he
            walked dry-shod across the slough. The log cabin was deserted. The door was standing
            open <pb n="114" id="VAA3895-112"/>but there was no one within. The breakfast dishes
            stood unwashed upon the table. They consisted of two tin cups, two tin plates, a like
            number of tin spoons and blackened steel knives and forks, with an immense frying pan
            holding the place of honor in the centre. It had evidently served the double purpose of
            having the bacon first cooked and then served therein. The odor of the fried meat still
            clung to the close air of the low-ceilinged room. Should he wait? Surely some one would
            return presently to straighten the untidy room. The sleeping bunks were even unmade.
            Yes, he would wait a bit--not inside--he would walk up and down in the sweet outdoor air
            of the early morning. He was hurt and angry. He had entered into the pioneer life beyond
            the big river simply, whole-heartedly, fearlessly, unsuspiciously. Suddenly and without
            warning he had been struck in the dark. It was a rude awakening.</p>
          <p>The sun climbed higher. The plains country winds could not penetrate to the little
            clearing in the heart of the woods so that here it was very warm and still, with the sun
            creeping insidiously through the thickening tree-tops. Presently from up stream, as he
            waited, came a familiar <pb n="115" id="VAA3895-113"/>sound, and soon the quiet, almost
            oppressive air was ringing with the monotonous repetition of blows from an axe in the
            hands of the wood-cutter. The day&apos;s work had begun. The probabilities were that
            there would be no returning to the house now until noon time. It seemed strange. It was
            not the way of the men of the West who kept house for themselves to leave until the
            primitive bachelor arrangements were as tidily disposed of as it was possible for them
            to be under the circumstances. It came to Jack, standing there pondering the unusualness
            of the early desertion, that it was a premeditated getting away. Perhaps he had been
            seen crossing the slough and perhaps he was not accounted a welcome guest. Well, he
            should follow his neighbor to the wood-chopping. He had come to see him and he meant to
            see him.</p>
          <p>He found LaDue up in the northern boundaries of the island, alone, cutting up a
            gigantic cottonwood that had been felled a few days before. The man ceased his labors,
            leaned his axe against a tree, and wiped his streaming face with a much soiled
            handkerchief.</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, it &apos;s you,&quot; he said, indifferently.</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jack. &quot;I stopped at the house, <pb n="115"
              id="VAA3895-114"/>but finding no one there, I came here. I heard the sound of your
            axe.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Was n&apos;t Henry to the house?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I did not see him.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;He must have been &apos;round some &apos;ers. Fine day.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;It is, indeed. I came over to see you, Mr. LaDue, about a little matter of
            business that I am sure you will be able to explain satisfactorily,&quot; began
            Jack. He paused a moment.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, spit &apos;er out. I got a lot o&apos; work to do to-day,
            sonny,&quot; responded LaDue, with suggestive impatience.</p>
          <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Jack, quietly, although the hot, impulsive blood
            burned in his face and tingled at his finger tips so that he longed to knock his
            neighbor down. &quot;I shall not keep you long. Briefly, then, this is the way of
            it. Last night, my sister saw you and your man cross one of the Broken Key milch cows to
            the other side. The animal has been missing for two or three days. Now, I know how easy
            it is, Mr. LaDue,&quot; continued Jack, diplomatically, &quot;to mistake cattle
            when they run at large, and it was after night, too, when you crossed this one. Mine
            have been feeding right here, near home, and I know <pb n="117" id="VAA3895-115"/>that
            many of them stray over to the island. But we have decided to let them feed north of the
            big gulch again so that there need be no more trouble. Is it not so?&quot;</p>
          <p>LaDue&apos;s face was convulsed with a great rage. His narrow eyes gleamed
            malignantly from beneath his heavy brows. His black, bristly, seven-days&apos; beard
            gave him a peculiarly unkempt appearance, as his house had looked when he left it.</p>
          <p>&quot;Now, you look here, young feller,&quot; he said,
            &quot;you&apos;ll do well to mind your own business. Don&apos;t you know
            that yet ? If you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll do a&apos;mighty well to learn.
            This ain&apos;t a meddlin&apos; country and we have a pretty good way
            o&apos; teaching fool tenderfeet who don&apos;t know their place nor their
            business--well, if we don&apos;t exactly teach &apos;em their business, we have
            a first-rate way o&apos; showin&apos; &apos;em pretty plain what
            ain&apos;t their business. Takin&apos; that in? Well, I did cross a cow last
            night--my own critter she was--and Henry drove her to the rest o&apos; the bunch in
            the hills. Now, then, is that explanation enough for you? You would n&apos;t have
            got the half from Frank LaDue if you were n&apos;t my neighbor.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="118" id="VAA3895-116"/>
          <p>He reached for his axe as if the subject and the call as well were both at an end.</p>
          <p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said Jack, firmly. &quot;That is not explanation
            enough. I had hoped that we might settle this--this disagreement amicably and I still
            hope that you will see the wisdom of not letting this affair go any farther and will
            agree to end it right here and now peacefully and with no one the wiser.
            Onjijitka--&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Thievin&apos;, lyin&apos; Sioux!&quot; muttered LaDue, with a
            scornful shrug of his shoulders.</p>
          <p>For a moment, it seemed as if Jack would spring at the man&apos;s throat and
            throttle him, so enraged was he at the brutal remark, but he controlled himself.</p>
          <p>&quot;Onjijitka,&quot; he continued, steadily, &quot;my sister&apos;s
            very dear friend--and mine--overheard, yesterday, your arrangements with Henry Hoffman
            on the boat to &apos;cross Carroll&apos;s critter&apos; when the wind went
            down. After supper, she followed you to the place where you had concealed the animal.
            She heard you say, LaDue, that you meant to have all of my stock if I stayed here. That
            was not very neighborly, now, was it? Why you should desire my removal from the country
            so heartily at the same time that you <pb n="119" id="VAA3895-117"/>plan to make a good
            thing out of my poor little herd is more than I can comprehend,&quot; he concluded,
            a little wistfully.</p>
          <p>LaDue&apos;s anger had seemingly passed away during this brief recital and he was
            now unconcernedly rolling a cigarette. He sat down upon the fallen log as if he had
            changed his mind about being in a hurry and reached for a wide chip which he whittled
            idly. Instantly, Jack became stern again.</p>
          <p>&quot;But if you think to force me out of the way by such means, I tell you now,
            LaDue, frankly, that you might as well spare yourself any further trouble, for I will
            never go. Do you hear? I will never go--alive.&quot; He paused a moment, then
            continued: &quot;So Onjijitka went back and told my sister and they made your
            rendezvous, too, together, only they kept back in the timber and they saw--all that
            there was to see. The moon was very bright, you will remember.&quot;</p>
          <p>LaDue waited until he had whittled away the last splinter in his chip and had begun on
            another; then he said, tolerantly:</p>
          <p>&quot;You never can believe Injuns, Carroll. They&apos;re the biggest liars and
            thieves in the world and half-breeds are the worst o&apos; all. You ain&apos;t
              <pb n="120" id="VAA3895-118"/>learned much if you ain&apos;t learned that yet. No
            one in this here country&apos;ll trust a half-breed out o&apos; his sight.
            Anybody&apos;s cattle is their cattle. That squaw was just makin&apos; trouble.
            She may have your critter herself for all I know, or else that thievin&apos;
            ol&apos; renegade of a Two Hawks. He does n&apos;t make no pretensions
            o&apos; livin&apos; on anything but &apos;slowelk.&apos; If
            you&apos;d have told me in the first place that this squaw critter had been
            stuffin&apos; you, I would n&apos;t have been so all-fired mad as I was, because
            I know Injuns. I killed a Injun once for rustlin&apos; one o&apos; my
            critters,&quot; he concluded, casually.</p>
          <p>&quot;Shall we leave Onjijitka out of the question for the present?&quot; said
            Jack, with cold authority. &quot;Miss Carroll saw the cow and knew it for our own.
            That is enough, I think. Now, what are you going to do about it?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Aho! So that&apos;s the way the wind blows, is it?&quot; said LaDue,
            with a disagreeable chuckle. &quot;I was askin&apos; her only yesterday why she
            was puttin&apos; on so many airs.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I asked you,&quot; said Jack, now white with passion, &quot;what are
            you going to do about it?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;And I answer you,&quot; replied LaDue, &quot;not a damned
            thing!&quot;</p>
          <pb n="121" id="VAA3895-119"/>
          <p>&quot;If you do not deliver that cow to me before noon on the day after to-morrow,
            I shall make you sweat for it,&quot; said Jack, deliberately.</p>
          <p>&quot;Do! Go ahead!&quot; taunted LaDue. &quot;I defy you! Prove that was
            not my cow, will you? How are you goin&apos; to do it? Tell me that,
            now!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You know very well how I shall prove it. I mean what I say. I understand
            perfectly, now, that little calf deal. And you dared to insinuate that I rustled that
            calf from you! That incident may not be closed after all. But leaving the calf
            altogether out of the question, I shall prosecute you just as surely as the cow is not
            returned to me by noon of the day after to-morrow. I give you until then because
            to-morrow we shall be at Lower Brule for the games. We go as far as Velpen to-night. I
            trust that you understand me thoroughly?&quot;</p>
          <p>The islander&apos;s passion was something terrible to see.</p>
          <p>&quot;You--you--upstart,&quot; he choked, &quot;do you think for a moment
            that there won&apos;t be a way found for plasterin&apos; your damned mouth
            before you have a chance to regale the officers with your pack o&apos; petticoat
            lies? A pretty sort o&apos; woman your sister must be to go spyin&apos;
            &apos;round <pb n="122" id="VAA3895-120"/>on the doin&apos;s o&apos; men.
            How could she tell whose blamed cow that was, and at night? It was a sorry day for her
            when she strayed away from her own and took to herdin&apos; with this bunch west
            o&apos; the river. A sorry day and you can tell her so for me. Now, then, young man,
            what are <hi rend="i">you</hi> goin&apos; to do about it?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I have told you,&quot; said Jack, quietly. &quot;You have until the
            day after to-morrow.&quot;</p>
          <p>He nodded curtly, turned, and strode quickly homeward.</p>
          <p>Left alone, LaDue fingered, restlessly, something that lay in a heavy holster at his
            hip. There was an ugly look in his eyes.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why did n&apos;t you?&quot; asked Henry Hoffman, lounging into view
            with the oars of the skiff over his big shoulders. There was a quizzical look in his
            blue eyes as he spoke.</p>
          <p>&quot;I did n&apos;t want to freeze you out of the game, Henry,&quot; said
            LaDue, calmly, reaching for his axe.</p>

          <head>UP THE MISSOURI</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE Wild West celebration to which Jack referred was not to be a
            tawdry imitation of, nor a burlesque on the peculiarities and environments of range
            life. It was to be a real, active, though friendly rivalry between real cowboys, with
            real, well-earned records to make or break and with real brands to represent, brands
            that were carried by thousands of animals and were known far and wide over the range
            country. This competitive trial of skill was to be held at Lower Brule Agency for two
            reasons. First, because the Indians were interested, but chiefly because it was neutral
            ground for the cowmen of the Bad River country and those of the south, accounting the
            Agency the dividing line. Between these two sections was a friendly feud of
            long-standing rivalry and the coming contest had been planned to settle some old scores,
            to decide some disputed points, and above all, to interrupt, however briefly, the
            unruffled monotony of the daily life of the cowboy ioneer. With Jack and Josepinme
            Carroll, when they <pb n="124" id="VAA3895-122"/>rode into Velpen the evening before the
            day of the games, were Tom Burrington, of the Seven-up, his mother and young brother
            Louis, but lately out from Chicago, the boy driving his mother in the buggy while Tom
            rode his favorite mount, a blooded animal but a famous cow horse none the less; Rosebud
            and her step-brother, Bear Heart, son of Two Hawks, of the Rosebud Indian Reservation.
            Bear Heart was a full-blooded, square-shouldered Sioux, who held as sacred the
            traditions of the past; who dreamed of a rehabilitated freedom and glory for his people,
            and who had promptly rejected the proffered advantages of civilization by running away
            from Carlisle, whither Two Hawks, at the earnest solicitation of Rosebud, warmly
            seconded by the Missionary Bishop, had sent him in a moment of unguarded and listless
            indifference. Bear Heart had stoically refused to go back and Two Hawks had not
            insisted.</p>
          <p>The little party went straight to the hotel. There seemed to be an unusual number of
            men hanging around the lobby. Many left the room upon the arrival of the new guests,
            three of whom were ladies, but they did not go far. They collected in small groups
            outside, not talking <pb n="125" id="VAA3895-123"/>much, but a plainly discernible air
            of expectancy pervaded each and every one as if something of supreme interest was booked
            to happen before long and no one wished to be very far off when the entry was called.
            While Jack registered for the party, Tom stepped out to give orders for the care of
            their horses. Upon re-entering the room, he was casually approached by a prominent
            merchant of the town in company with a neighbor from the White River country. Talking
            ceased all at once among the smokers who had elected to remain. The women had gone
            upstairs.</p>
          <p>&quot;Hello, Burrington,&quot; greeted the man from White River. &quot;Why,
            hello, Symes. So you are frittering away good time, too, are you, going up to watch
            those fool boys play monkey shines? We ought by rights to be in better business. Are you
            going up on the boat ?&quot;</p>
          <p>&apos;Nope. Not me. I got to feel leather between my knees when I &apos;m
            travellin&apos; or I ain&apos;t comfortable. Mr. Budlong, here, and the whole
            Velpen aggregation are goin&apos; up that way, though. I suppose you are, too,
            seein&apos;s you&apos;ve got your women folks with you.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="126" id="VAA3895-124"/>
          <p>&quot;Yes, we are going to take it easy this time. Who are entering from down our
            way, Symes? I have been too blamed busy to keep posted. What is going to
            happen?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, the usual things--horse racing and bronc&apos; busting and such
            child&apos;s play. Of course you &apos;re goin&apos; in for the
            ropin&apos; contest, ain&apos;t you, Burrington?&quot;</p>
          <p>There was a faint suggestion of anxiety in the matter-of-fact question. Jack sauntered
            over to the group, his hands in his pockets, waiting for the women to come down to go
            into the dining-room for a late supper.</p>
          <p>&quot;Not this time,&quot; said Tom, carelessly. &quot;I am all out of
            practice. It is too hard work, anyway. I am getting lazy.&quot;</p>
          <p>He turned at the sound of a step on the stair. It was only Louis, ill-content unless
            within sound of his big, gray-eyed hero&apos;s voice. He perched himself on the
            middle stair and prepared to listen to what was going on while still obeying his
            mother&apos;s request that he wait for her and Josephine and Rosebud.</p>
          <p>&quot;But, Mr. Burrington,&quot; interposed Budlong, anxiously, &quot;we
            have counted on you all the time. The boys are all agreed. Velpen is betting <pb n="127"
              id="VAA3895-125"/>heavily on you. Why, you must enter. We simply cannot get along
            without you.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;It seems to me that I have something to say in this matter,&quot; said
            Tom, with a laugh, &quot;and so I say that the boys had better call their bets off.
            I am not going in. I never thought about it seriously and--I &apos;d rather
            not.&quot;</p>
          <p>The men who had vacated the room but a little while ago now began filing slowly back
            again. They were impatient for the result of the plainly premeditated interview.</p>
          <p>&quot;But it&apos;s this way, Tom,&quot; urged Symes. &quot;The Pierre
            fellows are coming down, whole droves strong. There&apos;s a regular stampede of
            &apos;em, and they &apos;re makin&apos; a lot o&apos; talk about a
            wonder they&apos;ve got up there. They&apos;re braggin&apos; there
            ain&apos;t ary a man in the State can beat &apos;im--and we are bound to call
            that bluff. We&apos;re all agreed on you. There ain&apos;t nobody else we can
            dare trust agin&apos; that there miracle fellow they &apos;re blowin&apos;
            so much about. He &apos;s a new one. I never heard o&apos; him before.
            More&apos;n likely he ain&apos;t so much, after all, but we can&apos;t
            afford to run no risks. For the honor o&apos; old Kemah, we&apos;ve got to stop
            the big talk o&apos; those fellows up north. Ain&apos;t that so?&quot;</p>
          <pb n="128" id="VAA3895-126"/>
          <p>&quot;Well, but see here, boys,&quot; said Tom, including in his response the
            entire group, who by this time had frankly surrounded him, ready to lend their
            persuasive powers, if necessary, in order to win their point, &quot;I feel the honor
            and all that--you know that, don&apos;t you?--it is mighty good of you boys
            to--to-well, to think that I could do it--&quot; he was visibly embarrassed, for
            Josephine had at last appeared around the bend in the stairway and was standing quietly
            behind Louis, waiting--&quot;I appreciate your high rating of me--it is really
            downright good of you--but that is one reason why I hesitate. In fact, I cannot do it,
            boys. I should only disappoint you. I should stand no more show of winning than a
            jack-rabbit. That &apos;s honest. I am all out of practice. I have not half thrown a
            rope in ages and I do not know when I have made a tie. I should like to accommodate
            you--but I can&apos;t do it. I should lose for you and that I should hate like the
            dev--deuce. Get some one of whom you can be sure. I am all out of training and I cannot
            do it.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You&apos;re the only one we are sure of, Tom, and that &apos;s why
            you&apos;ve got to enter. You don&apos;t need no practice. You &apos;ll git
            there anyway. <pb n="129" id="VAA3895-127"/>You always do. There ain&apos;t a man
            west o&apos; the river can throw a rope like you--you know that, Tom--practice or no
            practice.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Let me see,&quot; said Tom, meditatively, &quot;who can we get to
            fight for our honor? There is Henry Hoffman. I can vouch for him. He used to outride for
            me. He was the best hand with a rope I ever saw. I think he works for Frank LaDue now.
            Why don&apos;t you get him? He comes from the Southwest and that is a recommendation
            in itself.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;No woodchoppers for us,&quot; said a cow-puncher on the outskirts, with a
            disdainful shrug of his shoulders. &quot;Thirty-seven seconds &apos;d make him
            look purty sick, I&apos;m thinkin&apos;.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;A fellow that&apos;s been haulin&apos; wood since March,&quot;
            said Symes, argumentatively, &quot;is more&apos;n likely somewhat out
            o&apos; practice, too.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;But I can&apos;t take my horse on the boat,&quot; pleaded Tom,
            &quot;and I am not alone, you know. I am with a party. I can&apos;t leave
            them.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;We &apos;ll see to it that that wall-eyed cayuse of yours is on the
            boat,&quot; returned Symes, promptly. &quot;Waitly &apos;ll take him if we
            boys insist. Well, we insist--so that &apos;s a go.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Have you any further objections to put <pb n="130" id="VAA3895-128"
            />forth?&quot; asked Budlong, with an appreciative smile at the inexhaustibility of
            Symes&apos;s arguments and the readiness with which he marshalled them forth to meet
            any and all objections.</p>
          <p>&quot;I cannot think of any more now,&quot; laughed Tom, helplessly.
            &quot;But I am afraid that you will be sorry. I will do the best I can--you know
            that, don&apos;t you? But I tell you now that I can never make it in thirty-seven
            seconds. If that &apos;miracle fellow&apos; can--well, remember that I warned
            you.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Then that &apos;s settled,&quot; said Symes, with a sigh of relief,
            and the crowd dispersed with noisy self-congratulations upon the successful installation
            of their unanimous choice of a champion.</p>
          <p>The <hi rend="i">Susie,</hi> temporarily out of commission as a ferryboat, left her
            wharf promptly at five o&apos;clock on the morning of the big day of the sports. No
            delay would be tolerated by her impatient patrons, for the programme of events was
            scheduled to open immediately after the early twelve o&apos;clock dinner and,
            counting on her best time and that no obstacles would be encountered, such as becoming
            annoyingly and indefinitely stranded upon a sand-bar, the boat could not possibly make
            the distance short of eleven. The early morning air <pb n="131" id="VAA3895-129"/>was
            soft and cool and still. The fussy little gasoline boat ploughed her way right gallantly
            up the yellow, turbulent channel, wisely keeping close in shore whenever feasible in
            order to follow the line of least resistance.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am so glad that you consented to uphold our standard,&quot; said
            Josephine, smilingly. &quot;I was afraid that you were going to refuse right out of
            hand, and then whatever should we have done?&quot;</p>
          <p>They had obtained seats on the west side of the engine house, all the party from the
            Seven-up, the Broken Key, and the Reservation, so as to be well out of the way of the
            late May sun when he should have warmed up to the work of the day. The rude camp stools
            of the women were propped against the outer wall to afford support for feminine backs,
            but Tom and Jack stood in front of them leaning carelessly against the railing, while
            the moody Indian, heedless of sun and disdaining the continued companionship of the
            loquacious whites, soon wandered forward and sat down upon the huge coil of rope that
            would later secure the boat to the landing at the Agency, and gazed silently,
            impassively, at the panorama of bluff and gulch and mouth of creek, the glint <pb
              n="132" id="VAA3895-130"/>of sun-struck mica and the dazzle of the white chalk rock
            with its corrugated surface where the rains and melted snows of centuries had worn their
            way to the river below, leaving innumerable little crinkles in their wake to bear
            witness to the constant erosion that had carved and scarred the rugged face of the
            bluffs of the Big Muddy. Louis neither sat nor stood; he was everywhere.</p>
          <p>&quot;It is all foolishness,&quot; responded Tom, soberly. Besides the
            disappointment that he feared he must inflict upon his friends, he had suddenly
            developed an intense aversion to making a show of himself before this gentle-mannered,
            high-bred girl from the Old South, he who had so often played the game with joyous zest.
            He was whittling away at a diamond willow which he had seized when, to avoid a huge,
            floating log, the boat had veered in close to the shore. &quot;I shall only
            disappoint the boys. I know my limitations. I should not be afraid to try if I were in
            training, but as it is--&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I am like the boys,&quot; said Josephine, gayly. &quot;I have no
            fear. We have builded our faith on a rock,&quot; she added, slowly, with just a
            perceptible darkening of the frank eyes. &quot;I do not forget, you see, when I,
            even I, came under your <pb n="133" id="VAA3895-131"/>all-conquering noose. Any one
            capable of roping a hysterical girl, teetering down stream on a bit of crazy ice, need
            surely have no uneasiness about a clumsy quadruped.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Ah, but you did not time me, Miss Carroll,&quot; retorted Tom.
            &quot;I was doubtless an hour at it; and moreover, I object to that term
            &apos;hysterical.&apos; I am here to testify that you never made a sound. You
            neither screamed nor cried nor moaned. You were pretty white, I confess, but you
            were--very brave.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Paralyzed,&quot; said Josephine, banteringly, &quot;or posing, maybe,
            for your lordship&apos;s approval.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;That being the case, I admire your superb self-control more than
            ever,&quot; said Tom, with a laugh of unbelief.</p>
          <p>&quot;Do not talk about it, children,&quot; interrupted Mrs. Burrington.
            &quot;It positively makes me shudder just to think about it. Do talk about something
            pleasant.&quot;</p>
          <p>But before the subject was shifted, Josephine flashed him a tiny smile as she said,
            softly, &quot;Remember, your friends have perfect faith in you,&quot; and Tom
            bowed his handsome head in grave acknowledgment and wished that he might fairly justify
            her confidence, on the field, but in his <pb n="134" id="VAA3895-132"/>heart he was
            dubious of what the close of the afternoon should bring forth.</p>
          <p>&quot;I say, Tom,&quot; panted Louis, coming up at that moment in great haste,
            his blue eyes snapping with excitement and scorn, his chubby face hot and moist from too
            long a stay on the sunny side, &quot;he says you are going to get beat all to
            nothing. I heard him telling somebody that you were too stuck up for this country,
            anyway, but that you would get your medicine this afternoon.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Hold on there, lad,&quot; interrupted Tom, good-naturedly, tossing his
            willow into the current, catching up the small boy and elevating him to a position on
            the railing, where he held him firmly. &quot;Who says what? Slow and easy
            now.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, Frank LaDue, of course. He &apos;s talking over there with some
            fellows and he said that Pierre man was the best ever. He said he had every record in
            cattledom beat. Now, what do you think of that?&quot;</p>
          <p>He slipped away from Tom&apos;s grasp and balanced himself dexterously without
            holding on to the railing, while the big brother who loved him eyed him sharply, but
            made no move to lay hold of him again, in spite of the mother&apos;s protests.</p>
          <p>&quot;He said he hoped you would get beat even if <pb n="135" id="VAA3895-133"/>you
            did belong to his diggings--it would serve you plumb right--that you were altogether too
            smart and were a little too blamed sure that you were the biggest frog in the puddle.
            You are, too, Tom, and that &apos;s the joke of it. Well, mother, you need
            n&apos;t frown at &apos;blamed.&apos; I made that over for your special
            benefit. He said &apos;damned,&apos; and worser ones, too, before he was
            through. His dictionary is n&apos;t like ours,&quot; he went on, airily and
            slangily, &quot;but of its kind, it is surely a dandy. He said you strutted around
            like God Almighty--well, mother, he did. I &apos;m just quoting, and quoting is
            n&apos;t swearing, is it? Now what do you think of that? I snickered right out. I
            could n&apos;t help it. He had n&apos;t seen me before and oh, gee! did
            n&apos;t he look mad, though? But he said he hoped you would hear what he&apos;d
            said--it might do you some good. And he &apos;d have spit tobacco on me,
            careless-like, if I had n&apos;t been too quick for him. Old snake-in-the-grass!
            When he got up he said something kind of under his breath about your
            &apos;Colloguin&apos; with tattlers and interlopers and land-grabbers.&apos;
            &apos;Colloguin&apos; isn&apos;t in my dictionary,&quot; he concluded
            ingenuously, but no one helped him to a better understanding.</p>
          <pb n="136" id="VAA3895-134"/>
          <p>Jack&apos;s smooth, boyish face hardened, Josephine&apos;s became wistful,
            while Rosebud tapped the floor with her moccasined right foot, nervously. Tom alone
            seemed unmoved, but Mrs. Burrington, who knew him best, perceived that his keen but
            usually laughing eyes had narrowed ever so slightly, which was a bad sign.</p>
          <p>&quot;To me, that has an ugly ring,&quot; said Jack. &quot;Look out for
            foul play, Tom.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;If there is going to be any trickery,&quot; said Mrs. Burrington,
            imploringly, &quot;for goodness&apos; sake, Tom, keep out of it. You said that
            you would not go in. Don&apos;t have anything to do with the wretched affair. It is
            a constant wonder to me why I will come back to this uncanny country. Every Summer, I
            make up my mind firmly that it shall be my last and yet here I am again, silly old woman
            that I am, to whom gray hairs have brought no corresponding sense. A nice situation
            this, for an old woman and a babe!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Babe! I don&apos;t see any babe,&quot; exploded Louis, fearful for
            his dignity when he was so soon to be a man of affairs in the cattle country--like Tom.
            &quot;And, Tom, I &apos;d beat or bust now if I were you. Me and Bear Heart
            &apos;ll watch out for foul play, won&apos;t we, old fellow?&quot; he con-
              <pb n="137" id="VAA3895-135"/>cluded, appealing to his good friend, the Indian, who
            had left his position on the coil of rope and sauntered forward.</p>
          <p>The Indian nodded gravely.</p>
          <p>&quot;Bear Heart and the little brother will watch,&quot; he said
            unemotionally.</p>
          <p>&quot;What a tempest in a tea-pot, to quote you, mother,&quot; said Tom,
            laughing heartily. &quot;There will be no trickery. Our friend dislikes me so
            thoroughly that he has pinned his faith to this wise man who has come out of the North.
            That is all. It is easy to prophesy catastrophe for those you hate. Trickery? That is
            not the game we cowmen play.&quot; His face became stern. &quot;We play the game
            fair or we play it not at all. Don&apos;t think for a minute that I shall submit to
            trickery. That word,&quot; he smiled suddenly, winningly, &quot;is not in my
            dictionary.&quot;</p>

        <div2 type="chapter">
          <head>CHAPTER X</head>
          <head>THE CONTEST</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">S</hi>OME squaws, waist deep in the shore water washing print garments,
            ducked behind a drift of logs as the <hi rend="i">Susie</hi> slanted in toward the
            landing. They resented the amused stare of the passengers, refused to furnish
            entertainment for the insolent white man, and so hid themselves with only their heads
            appearing above the logs, their black eyes snapping defiance. A cavalcade of cowboys
            swept down to meet the incoming boat with much clatter of hoofs and with clouds of dust.
            A boat landing at Lower Brule under ordinary circumstances was a novelty, but this one
            was possessed of unusual interest because it had been early bruited about that he whom
            the cattlemen south of the Agency were to present as the champion roper, was travelling
            hither that way. Symes was there to see to it that Burrington had not changed his mind,
            though there was little fear of that, for his word once given was never broken and his
            friends knew this and respected him for it. Still, Symes could not help being anxious.
            He held sectional supremacy as <pb n="139" id="VAA3895-137"/>a very precious thing and
            he had seen this much-lauded hero from the north and had felt instinctively that Tom
            Burrington of the Seven-up was the only man of theirs who would not be outclassed by
            this tough, wiry, cool-eyed candidate for new honors. So it behooved him, Symes, to see
            to it that nothing prevented Tom&apos;s entering the lists that afternoon. It was to
            be the crowning event of the day. Nothing appeals to the cowboy like a good throw and a
            good tie. Other things would be interesting, even exciting, but there would be nothing
            quite equal in real sport to the contest, which was the last thing on the programme,
            with the exception of the Indian grass dance, played in full regalia, with which event
            any sort of unusual celebration at the Agency always closed, a concession on the part of
            the Government to the perpetuity of the memory of the days of the Dakotahs.</p>
          <p>Those who had come up the river on the boat walked to the Agency, straggling across the
            prairie by twos and threes, accepting with more or less good-nature the dust of the
            riders who raced to the pleasure grounds in a childish exuberance of spirits because of
            the holiday, and perhaps, too, with an unacknowledged impulse to &quot;show <pb
              n="140" id="VAA3895-138"/>off&quot; their really wonderful prowess before this
            foolish crowd of tenderfeet from town. Tom walked with his friends, leading his horse,
            apparently having forgotten all about his uneasiness as to the result of the coming
            trial. Josephine was so frankly pleased with everything and was so palpably enjoying
            herself and appealed to him so many times for explanation or confirmation that he had no
            will to mar her pleasure by any further croaking of evil to come, and so gave himself up
            to a quiet enjoyment of her high spirits and unbridled curiosity as to anything and
            everything that concerned the life of these wards of the Government.</p>
          <p>The tepees especially interested her. They were laid out in a semi-circle on a wide
            flat about half a mile from the Agency. They were temporary homes, most of them, pitched
            thus conveniently for the celebration, their canvas walls gleaming spectrally on the
            sunny plain, well removed from the shade of the river trees. The Lower Brule Indians had
            been gathering for days from even the utmost confines of the Reservation and their
            assembled camp-fires would gleam redly for many a night yet to come.</p>
          <p>&quot;I realize perfectly that I am making a tre- <pb n="141" id="VAA3895-139"
            />mendous nuisance of myself,&quot; said Josephine, with a longing glance across the
            white distance to where the tents sat so lazily in the glare of the sun, &quot;but
            how I should love to go &apos;a-visiting.&apos; &quot;</p>
          <p>She had shaded her eyes with her gauntletted hands, her felt hat was pushed far back on
            her head and the moisture on her forehead--the May day was as warm as June--had curled
            numerous little tendrils of shining hair. She was so altogether lovable, so irresistibly
            compelling, so intensely feminine in spite of her rough riding attire, and withal so
            quietly, unquestioningly and unpresumingly ready for and equal to the emergency of a
            sojourn in this rough-edged region, that Tom Burrington swore another oath under his
            breath, a stronger oath than the embryonic one that he had sworn on the day the ice went
            out, when she sat warming her feet at his own fireside, an oath that she should never
            leave the cattle country--never--for any other home. He should force it to blossom
            contentment for her. He hailed a passing buckboard that was in a weird state of
            dilapidation and rattled whiningly. It was drawn by a pair of ragged and vicious-looking
            Indian ponies and <pb n="142" id="VAA3895-140"/>they were driven by a deeply seamed,
            gnarled, hawk-eyed veteran of many a hunt and many a warpath, and this ancient and
            picturesque red man was at once pressed into service. While the rest of the party made
            ready for dinner, he drove Tom and Josephine the rounds of the Summer village where Tom
            was well known to many, and on the most friendly terms with all.</p>
          <p>The white canvas of the wall tent testified to the encroaching influence of
            civilization, but the majority of the tepees were erected on the time-honored plan of
            the forefathers. A series of poles forming a circle were brought together at the top and
            tied with strips of rawhide; around these the canvas was stretched, leaving an aperture
            at the top through which the fumes of the kinnikinnic and, in case of necessity, the
            smoke of the wood fire might escape. Encircling these crude chimneys and extending two
            feet above were the crossed tops of the tepee poles. Suspended from each of these poles,
            like pennants from a staff, was a bright ribbon-like strip of beef much resembling a
            strip of red flannel. The action of the sun and pure air soon dried these strips, the
            smoke of the indispensable kinnikinnic cured and flavored them, and the result was, to
            the red man, <pb n="143" id="VAA3895-141"/>a very delectable food product known as
            jerked beef. In the centre of the semicircle was a tent made of the tanned skins of the
            buffalo and elk stretched over smoke-stained poles with the moth-damaged hair side on
            the interior. The outside of the skins, the tanned side, was profusely decorated with
            Indian drawings in blue, red, and yellow pigments, conveying to the initiated a complete
            history of the tribe and the occupant. This was the tepee of Standing Cloud, the last of
            the hereditary chiefs of the Brule Sioux.</p>
          <p>Tom and Josephine visited and chatted and gave pennies to the bright-eyed but
            speechless little children, and bought moccasins, beaded and tribe-marked, right from
            the feet of a laughing, bashful, young squaw. It was a very pleasant hour for them both
            and made for good comrade-ship.</p>
          <p>It was not until after dinner, when Tom was finding the best places for his party on a
            grassy plot to the west of the ball grounds, that he thought at all of the contest in
            which he himself was to be so important a factor. It would be a grave misfortune to lose
            the game for his people; not so much for himself, his personal pride could easily stand
            the shock of defeat, but he could not <pb n="144" id="VAA3895-142"/>bear to think that
            his friends should lose prestige, and through him; and those northern ranch-men were
            already arrogant enough. Not so much for himself--that was true--and yet he knew that it
            would be one of the bitterest moments of his life if, when the sun was low, he must
            needs come back to--her, across the level stretch of country, figuratively trailing his
            colors in the dust. If only he were in training! If only, as long as he must, he had
            planned to do this thing.</p>
          <p>The field which had been chosen for the games was about a quarter of a mile from the
            Agency buildings and a little to the west. Josephine scorned an umbrella, but Mrs.
            Burrington raised hers with a placid smile of acceptance of her inability to love the
            unguarded sun of the prairie, and prepared to take a sort of resigned interest in the
            proceedings. People had begun drifting thither long before the hour set. They were a
            strange assemblage--cow-punchers, ranchmen, people of the town, a smattering of
            government officials, and a host of Lower Brule and Crow Creek Indians. There was much
            talking and eating of peanuts, much betting and much smoking of cigarettes, in the midst
            of which the programme of events was opened.</p>
          <pb n="145" id="VAA3895-143"/>
          <p>There was a ball game first between a bunch of town boys and a stalwart nine composed
            entirely of young Brule bucks--lost to the town, for which Josephine leaned over and
            hugged Rosebud ecstatically, while Rosebud said nothing though her eyes shone with
            pleasure and pride. Horse races and foot races followed each other in rapid succession.
            There was a round of bronco busting in which Bear Heart acquitted himself with much
            glory, outclassing his worthiest rival on a foul of &quot;grabbing
            leather,&quot; and then while the enthusiasm for the good showing made by the Indian
            from the southern Reservation was at its highest pitch, Tom Burrington arose from his
            place beside his friends on the grassy plot and slipped quietly away in search of his
            horse.</p>
          <p>It was very warm. The sky of the late and cloudless afternoon was very blue. The wind
            of the plains was holding its breath so that it was very still everywhere except in that
            one tiny spot set down in the midst of illimitable, solemn, and shimmering space where a
            handful of human beings yelled lustily and gyrated foolishly and otherwise disported
            themselves as if they were of much, much consequence. They were people of the plains,
            accustomed only to God&apos;s heavens and <pb n="146" id="VAA3895-144"/>the
            limitless stretch of scenery to bound their enthusiasm, so that their isolation was not
            strikingly palpable to them, and yet they were men, so that their play was the less
            incongruous to them.</p>
          <p>There were seven entries for the roping contest, and the rough badinage that was
            without malice amongst the contestants and their friends, kept the crowd in a tumult of
            good humor.</p>
          <p>Bill Dulan, a tall, muscular, middle-aged athlete, foreman and joint proprietor of the
            I bar U ranch located near the border line, an adept with the rope and a sure shot with
            rifle or &quot;six-gun,&quot; was chosen as referee. Climbing upon the arch
            above the smaller gate of the corral, he proceeded to announce the rules of the contest.
            With a bow directed toward the group of ladies, he described a wide semi-circle with his
            broad-brimmed light hat with a fair leather strap for a band, and began:</p>
          <p>&quot;Ladies, cow-punchers, feller citizens, and Injuns, this here &apos;s
            goin&apos; to be a contest and you can bet your life it&apos;s goin&apos; to
            be fair. The I bar U outfit never plays a favorite; you can put your money on your
            favorite puncher and you &apos;ll sure collect if he &apos;s the swiftest with
            his string. Bud <pb n="147" id="VAA3895-145"/>McGonnigal of Texas is holdin&apos;
            the world&apos;s record at thirty-seven seconds and the rules here will be
            Bud&apos;s rules, &apos;Steer down and hog-tied, three feet tied
            together.&apos; No dead steers count, so look out for the broken necks or you will
            have to try again. Your throw rope and two six-foot ropes in the belt must do the
            business. Now some of you galoots splice your ropes together and run a half ring from
            the fence at the right to the fence to the left of this gate and the puncher sets his
            saddle by the gate and moves narry a peg until the steer crosses the line.&quot;</p>
          <p>Five of the contestants had cheerfully performed their part of the game, all having
            hog-tied their steers in artistic fashion, but none of them having gotten below the
            minute record. One neck was broken and the Indians had dragged off the carcass for
            beef.</p>
          <p>When the man from the north country rode up to the gate of the enclosure where the
            untamed monarchs of the range were milling restlessly, a great cheer ascended into the
            vaulted blue and went sounding over the prairie. His reputation had preceded him and
            some of his admirers even expected him to break the record of Bud McGonnigal. With his
            advent upon the field began the <pb n="148" id="VAA3895-146"/>real interest of the day.
            He was a well-built young fellow, not so large as Tom, but tough, wiry, supple, entirely
            at home in the saddle. He was apparently oblivious to the furor into which his
            appearance had thrown the crowd. He shifted his quid of tobacco carelessly and bided his
            time with the utmost unconcern, one leg thrown over the saddle horn, one hand toying
            with the roached mane of his cow horse. He was not an individual owner, but was foreman
            of a big syndicate ranch in the middle north. Sitting there so carelessly, he was the
            picture of self-confidence, sure of his ability to throw a rope, range-bred and
            consequently haughty in manner; but he lacked Tom&apos;s general popularity, on
            account, in part, of his connection with outside capital. Still, numerous friends from
            the Pierre country had followed him here--a boisterous, confident, clamorous bunch of
            rooters, who vociferously rallied to his support and promptly covered every dollar put
            up by the southern men, who were equally confident of their champion&apos;s ability
            to humble the pride of this arrogant northerner. The betting ran high and incessant. The
            honor of the range forbade that this stranger out of the north, reputed to be so
            wonderfully expert, <pb n="149" id="VAA3895-147"/>rumored to have made
            Montana&apos;s record, should set the time for the Dakota ranges.</p>
          <p>Conspicuous among the Pierre contingent was Frank LaDue, loud-mouthed, swaggering, and
            betting heavily against the man from his own country.</p>
          <p>&quot;Loyal to his home range and a man of high notions of honor,&quot; said
            Jack, in an ironical undertone.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, of course,&quot; Josephine excused him, conscientiously, though
            reluctantly, &quot;he is not a real cattleman, you know. He is only a--chopper of
            wood. So I suppose that he ought not to be held culpable for arraying himself on the
            side of his own personal inclinations.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;He is Tom&apos;s neighbor, just the same,&quot; retorted Jack,
            finding no shadow of a justification of the man&apos;s unusual conduct,
            &quot;and he derives his livelihood from the southern ranges. He has belittled an
            affair of honor among peoples to the level of a vulgar personal spite of no moment. He
            might at least have had the decency to stay at home.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care, I am glad he is betting so steep,&quot; broke in
            Louis, vengefully. &quot;Old skee-zicks! When he loses everything he &apos;s got
            and is <pb n="150" id="VAA3895-148"/>nothing but a beggarly old bankrupt, he need
            n&apos;t think he can come whining around Tom for a job. No, siree! Why, Tom would
            n&apos;t any more dream of letting him punch one of his cows than he &apos;d
            dream of flying over the moon, and if he did I &apos;d punch his head for it.
            Gee!&quot;</p>
          <p>The corral gate at the right of the champion of the north country swung back and
            instantly every eye was bent upon the opening. Out trotted a steer with his horns low to
            the ground and, catching sight of the crowd, essayed to turn and rejoin his fellows; but
            the gate swung shut, a cowboy yell went up from the crowd, and the magnificent animal,
            throwing his muzzle high in the air, started with the swiftnessof a stag for the open
            prairie beyond. As he crossed the twenty-yard line, the feet of the waiting horseman
            dropped into the stirrups with a click, his right hand sank to the throw rope upon his
            saddle, his left grasped the reins and the rowels sank into the flanks of the cow horse.
            Half a dozen swift leaps and the rope went singing through the air, the loop settling
            over the head of the terrified steer. The horse swerved suddenly to the right, fetching
            the slack of the rope down over the left side and thigh of the steer, then, as suddenly
              <pb n="151" id="VAA3895-149"/>facing the animal, he braced his feet for the inevitable
            shock, as the rider took a half hitch in the rope around the saddle horn, leaping to the
            ground as the steer landed fairly on his back. The horse began backing away to keep the
            rope tight as the cowboy sprang toward the prostrate animal, fashioning a loop in one of
            his short ropes as he ran. Dropping this over the right hind foot as it came forward in
            a kick, he swiftly took a half hitch around the right fore foot as the two met; tying
            the loose end of the rope around the other fore foot, he raised both hands aloft and the
            steer lay &quot;hog-tied,&quot; unable to arise. The stentorian voice of Bill
            Dulan announced the time, &quot;Thirty-nine seconds,&quot; and the crowd broke
            into wild cheering, friend and foe alike giving credit to the fine horsemanship and the
            excellent work of the stranger. There was nothing narrow about these men; they gave
            praise ungrudgingly where praise was due.</p>
          <p>When Tom Burrington rode up to the gate, a sudden hush fell upon the people while they
            measured him by those thirty-nine seconds. &quot;Can he do it?&quot; was the
            query of north and south alike as they gazed upon the perfect physique and careless
            smile of the champion of the southern <pb n="152" id="VAA3895-150"/>slope. Then cheer
            upon cheer went up from admiring throats as the ranchmen did homage to their hero who
            was to uphold the honor of the southern range. He rode easily, smilingly, to his
            station. If he was disturbed by a doubt as to his ability to lower the excellent record
            set, no one was the wiser by look or sign from him. He was perfectly self-contained as
            he turned his gaze toward that portion of the ground where his particular friends had
            been seated in close proximity to an umbrella. There was no umbrella visible now. It lay
            trampled in the dust under foot, while the low, reddening sun of the closing day beat
            unheeded upon the gray head of a handsome, stately woman of the city, who had arisen
            with the rush of intense feeling called forth by the appearance there at the gate of her
            big, self-reliant, smiling, splendid son. Beside her stood Josephine, her eyes bright as
            stars, the color burning in her cheeks, her lips parted. To these two, Tom doffed his
            plainsman&apos;s hat and then laughed aloud to see his small but wildly enthusiastic
            brother dragged back by the hand of Carroll as he would have rushed to him in his boyish
            excitement.</p>
          <p>During the short interval between his arrival <pb n="153" id="VAA3895-151"/>and the
            opening of the gate, the betting was renewed, eager voices calling their challenges and
            others equally loyal promptly accepting them. Suddenly, startlingly distinct, came the
            astonishing proposition:</p>
          <p>&quot;I &apos;ve got another hundred here, boys! Two to one on
            Pierre!&quot;</p>
          <p>The speaker was Frank LaDue--a close neighbor, as neighbors were in that day, of the
            Seven-up ranch. An attempt to repeat the challenge was literally drowned in the chorus
            of voices anxious to cover his extraordinary bet.</p>
          <p>The smile left Tom&apos;s lips and his eyes narrowed in the old dangerous way. He
            was dressed simply as the cowboy dresses when on duty, without the showy embellishments
            of an earlier day or the affectation of a later. His dark blue flannel shirt fitted
            easily over his broad shoulders and was left open at the throat. The inevitable
            gauntletted gloves, to protect his hands from the scorching of a possible running rope,
            were without ornament or fringe. At his belt on either side hung the short tie-rope
            peculiar to the contest. His trousers were tucked into his riding boots, that had the
            high cowboy heels to prevent the foot slipping too far into the stirrup. About <pb
              n="154" id="VAA3895-152"/>his throat was-a gay, loosely knotted, carefully adjusted
            handkerchief.</p>
          <p>The gate swung back once more and a shaggy, black three-year-old steer came through it
            with a bellow and made a break for freedom. Scarcely had its hoofs touched the distance
            line when Tom&apos;s horse was after it with the sagacity of a trained cow horse,
            while the crowd went deathly still. Tom&apos;s muscular right arm circled above his
            head, shot forward, and the noose settled over the head of the steer with a full third
            of the rope&apos;s length to spare. He had never made a better throw in his life and
            he knew it and exulted in victory in sight. The half hitch around the saddle horn had
            been taken and the tie-rope was in his hand as the horse braced himself for the shock.
            When it came, the horse went over backward while saddle and rider shot through the air
            as if projected from a catapult.</p>
          <p>&quot;For God&apos;s sake, keep the people back!&quot; cried Jack, who was
            the first to reach the motionless, white-faced form that lay stretched upon the grass.
            &quot;Symes, Bear Heart! Keep them back, I say! We must have air!&quot;</p>
          <p>It was the mother who took the quiet head upon her lap, sitting there upon the trampled
              <pb n="155" id="VAA3895-153"/>earth, but Josephine had taken one of the inert hands
            and was chafing it, softly, blindly, while Louis gave vent to his grief in wild sobs.
            But Tom was only stunned and no bones were broken and when water was brought and his
            face laved in it, he opened his eyes and gazed about in a bewildered manner, and then,
            remembering, smiled.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, I lost out. I did the best I could. Tell the boys I &apos;m sorry.
            What happened? How came I here?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;It was n&apos;t fair,&quot; sobbed Josephine.</p>
          <p>Tom raised his eyes caressingly to her face. &quot;I don&apos;t seem to
            remember just what happened,&quot; he said, &quot;but it must have been
            fair.&quot;</p>
          <p>When it was ascertained beyond doubt that Tom was not killed, not even seriously
            injured, congratulations for the unannounced winner began, and the crowd, somewhat
            subdued, commenced to disperse. Most of the Indians had already stolen away to make
            preparations for their grass dance and were even now assembling in the unfloored,
            corral-like bowery that had the heavens for its canopy, the leafy branches for its
            walls, and the grass of the prairie for its carpet.</p>
          <p>&quot;Look! Look!&quot; cried Louis, and coming to- <pb n="156"
              id="VAA3895-154"/>ward the group kneeling about the fallen champion, was Bear Heart
            carrying over his arm the saddle that had so treacherously given way at the crucial
            moment. Tom had scarcely struck the ground when a dozen riders were after the maddened
            steer as he dashed away and the rope and saddle were recovered promptly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Ugh! Waniche!&quot; grunted Bear Heart, inadvertently lapsing into the
            laconic brevity of the Sioux, as he pointed to the cleanly broken girth-strap dangling
            from the saddle, his face sternly fixed and his eyes keenly ablaze with the light of
            discovery.</p>
          <p>Tom sprang to his feet with a suddenness that set his head to spinning and almost
            unbalanced his mother and Josephine, who were kneeling one on either side of him.</p>
          <p>&quot;Let me see it,&quot; he commanded, peremptorily.</p>
          <p>&quot;Bear Heart is right,&quot; said Jack, slowly passing the saddle up for
            Tom&apos;s inspection. The break had occurred under the saddle skirt where the
            ladigo strap passes through the cinch ring--a leather-covered ring, hidden from view by
            the saddle skirt. It was a clean break--too clean--and the Indian redeeming his promise
            to the boy to watch, had discovered it, and his eye, <pb n="157" id="VAA3895-155"
            />trained by practice to note the slightest sign, had detected in the break foul
            play.</p>
          <p>&quot;What does it mean?&quot; asked Josephine, breathlessly watching the stern
            faces of the men.</p>
          <p>&quot;It means,&quot; said Tom, painfully straightening himself and placing a
            steadying hand upon Jack&apos;s shoulder, &quot;it means that some one cut that
            strap with a sharp knife, just enough so that the strain of cinching the saddle would
            not break it, in all probability, but the sudden strain of the falling steer would
            surely snap it, as it did. It means, too, that my fall was a foul and that I have
            another trial coming in this contest--if I may have your saddle, Symes.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;No, no, Tom!&quot; cried Josephine, a note of pain, too sharp and sudden
            to be disguised, ringing in her voice. His only answer was a swift look and a reassuring
            smile.</p>
          <p>&quot;You shall not do it,&quot; declared the elder woman, vehemently,
            &quot;Is n&apos;t one killing enough? You are as weak as a babe and it would
            simply be suicide, and I forbid it!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You--are too much shaken up to try again,&quot; pleaded Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;And you would only lose,&quot; argued Mrs. Burrington, desperately,
            realizing even as she spoke <pb n="158" id="VAA3895-156"/>that she was wasting words in
            attempting to change the stubborn mind of her unswerving son who had determined his
            course and would follow it even if the heavens should fall.</p>
          <p>&quot;It would have taken all your strength before. What can you do now that your
            strength is gone?&quot; she continued, rebelling hotly, but, she felt, in vain,
            against the clearly formed but yet unspoken decision of her son.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am afraid you are pretty weak yet, Tom,&quot; advised Jack, doubtfully,
            &quot;I think that you had better call it off for this time, don&apos;t you? We
            can get even later on when you are yourself again.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Will you get your saddle, Symes?&quot; was the grim answer, and Symes
            turned gladly toward his horse.</p>
          <p>&quot;What &apos;s all this fool talk about a new trial?&quot; demanded
            LaDue, touching the arm of the referee.</p>
          <p>&quot;Burrington gets a new trial. Some one fouled his traps,&quot; ruled the
            referee, curtly.</p>
          <p>&quot;The hell you say! A man fool enough to go into a thing like this with a
            faulty saddle deserves what he gets. Why, the saddle &apos;s part o&apos; the
            game. It is n&apos;t professional to be careless <pb n="159" id="VAA3895-157"/>with
            a thing like that. You know that mighty well, Bill,&quot; continued the bully.</p>
          <p>&quot;It is my decision that the saddle was tampered with to throw this contest. Do
            you catch that?&quot; responded Bill Dulan, as he turned and looked LaDue squarely
            in the eye. &quot;Tom Burrington&apos;s saddle is the apple of his eye and I
            &apos;ll bet the best string of ponies I&apos;ve got that it was in perfect
            condition the last time he looked at it, and I don&apos;t think that was very long
            ago, either, and he gets another chance.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;What right have you to change the rules, or make new ones?&quot; snarled
            LaDue, angrily.</p>
          <p>&quot;I &apos;m the referee and he gets another chance. Do you hear
            that?&quot; shouted stout-hearted Bill, as he turned his back on the grumbler.</p>
          <p>&quot;I &apos;ve looked at that harness and the gentleman is sure entitled to a
            fair chance, for he did n&apos;t have it before.&quot; All heads were turned to
            look at the new speaker and a cheer went up as they saw that it was the Pierre champion
            who spoke. They loved fair play, these plainsmen.</p>
          <p>The scattering crowd had rushed back to the corrals when it became known that Tom
            Burrington was to have another trial. His pluck and the general belief that he had been
            the victim <pb n="160" id="VAA3895-158"/>of foul play had made him more than ever a
            favorite.</p>
          <p>Again it was a black steer that was released--a hornless galloway, as wild as a native
            buffalo and as fleet as an ordinary horse. But Tom&apos;s mount was a racer. As the
            black mass crossed the line, the horse made a mighty spring that had often won for him
            as a quarter horse, and in a moment had closed up the intervening gap and was pressing
            close to the steer&apos;s side; yet Tom&apos;s arm hung by his side with the
            hondeau of the loop resting on his thumb. The vast crowd stood motionless, scarcely
            daring to breathe, as the people realized that the champion of the south, fearing
            probably for his strength, contemplated the most difficult of all throws, a foot catch.
            It was not only the most difficult, but also the most uncertain catch even for an expert
            such as he was.</p>
          <p>Suddenly the arm raised, the rope shot out, the loop missing the steer&apos;s head
            by several feet, and a groan went up from the women and tenderfeet; but the cowmen held
            their breath in admiration as Tom&apos;s stout lungs let out a yell that caused the
            steer to dodge suddenly to the right and the trick was accomplished. His shoulders
            striking the rope just above the loose-sliding <pb n="161" id="VAA3895-159"/>hondeau,
            caused the loop to swing toward him, and with the next lunge, both his front feet went
            into it. Like a flash the horse turned to the left, answering the pressure of
            Tom&apos;s knee, for he had dropped the reins and already held the short tie-rope in
            his hand.</p>
          <p>The rope tightened, with a snap like a pistol shot, as the horse wheeled and braced his
            feet. But the saddle held, and the galloway, turning a complete somersault, lay
            struggling with his front feet effectually tied and one of his hind legs over the rope
            below the hock joint. With a skill that comes only with a cool head and long training,
            Tom deftly dropped the short rope over the free hind leg and, with the rapidity almost
            of thought, put a half hitch over the other and a final tie over the two front feet
            together, and the steer lay helpless with his four feet tied together.</p>
          <p>Tom&apos;s hands went into the air and the tensely quiet crowd broke loose in a
            series of such wild cheers as the little bend had never before heard as the referee
            announced the result, &quot;Thirty-seven seconds.&quot; The world&apos;s
            record had been tied and the honor of the southern range had been upheld.</p>
          <pb n="162" id="VAA3895-160"/>
          <p>&quot;By Jove! Thirty-seven seconds with a man whose wind had been completely
            knocked out of him not half an hour before is going some,&quot; said Jack, as they
            walked back to the Agency through the fast-fading light.</p>
          <p>There was a clatter of hoofs, clouds of dust, and a bedlam-like yelling, as an
            enthusiastic crowd of cowboys swept past them, each shouting some expression of praise
            for his hero. He was a very human hero and coughed disgustedly at the choking smudge of
            dust that enveloped them.</p>
          <p>&quot;Bully!&quot; shouted Symes. &quot;Bully!&quot; he roared again,
            ecstatically, as he raced past at the end of the cavalcade. &quot;I&apos;ve got
            some two-to-ones to settle with Frank LaDue! Bully!&quot; And
            &quot;Bully!&quot; yelled Louis from his seat on the saddle in front of Symes,
            where he was doing his full share of celebrating.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am mighty glad that I won for the boys,&quot; said Tom, simply, and
            then he turned toward Josephine. &quot;It is a good country,&quot; he added.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
          <head>THE BIG GULCH</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">G</hi>IRT with the spoils of war, an abandonment of lightsome spirits,
            loose tongues, and hoarse voices, the victorious delegation from the south swarmed
            noisily on board the <hi rend="i">Susie</hi> with the first coming of dusk, and the
            stanch little boat, with the telling help of the swift current, chugged and quivered its
            rapid way down the darkening river. Their friends from the Seven-up remained in town for
            the night, but Jack and Josephine rode home through the still late hours, for at the
            Broken Key there had been no one left behind to tend the stock which had been turned
            loose to feed at will. With them rode the Indians, Rosebud and Bear Heart.</p>
          <p>In the early morning of the next day, Jack and Josephine together drove the cattle
            north-ward and across the big gulch, where a well defined cattle trail led to the grass
            lands beyond. At noon of the same day, Jack came into the living room of the Broken Key
            with stern eyes <pb n="164" id="VAA3895-162"/>and a determined set to the jaws that were
            so rapidly losing their boyish curves. He ate his mid-day dinner silently. Josephine,
            too, said little. At one o&apos;clock he put a lump of sugar in his pocket, left the
            room, went to the stable, took down his saddle and bridle, flung them across his
            shoulders, and returned to Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;Jack!&quot; she cried, in appealing remonstrance, &quot;You are not
            going to cross the river with--him?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Jack, with a half return of his old gay smile.
            &quot;It is quite in keeping, according to my notion, for him to furnish me
            transportation in order that I may lodge my complaint against him with the proper
            authorities. He has given me just cause for complaint. Surely, then, he owes me the
            means of prosecuting the same. Is not that a logical and reasonable supposition, sister
            mine? You would not want our neighbor to mutilate his free gift by not allowing him to
            put on the finishing touches, would you? It is a rare talent, Jo, that has the grace to
            accept generously. We will cultivate it, you and I.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You would make fun if you were going to die this minute,&quot; said
            Josephine. &quot;But I am <pb n="165" id="VAA3895-163"/>afraid, Jack. It seems just
            like--oh, I do not know what it seems like, but it seems awful. Why don&apos;t you
            go around by Kemah? Cannot you ford White River somewhere?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, yes, but it is much farther. I &apos;ll just take my rifle--if you
            will hand it to me--that&apos;s a good girl. It is the only gun I know anything
            about and so what &apos;s the use of hampering myself with those foolish little
            forty-fivers the gentlemen of the northern ranges affect so lovingly? If I had occasion
            to shoot at a rattler like enough I should blaze away with the butt end levelled at him.
            Who would care for Josie then? But, Josephine,&quot; he continued, more soberly,
            &quot;you need not be in the least afraid. Henry Hoffman is going to row me across
            in the skiff and in all probability I shall not see LaDue at all. I shall take a horse
            from the other side. Hence this loaf of sugar.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Let the old cow go,&quot; whispered Josephine, slipping her arms around
            the neck of this young pioneer brother of hers, whose high hopes and lofty ambitions
            would make him a cattleman of the great northern ranges by and by--if it was to be. He
            seemed to her very young in that moment and she had a choking, blind longing to <pb
              n="166" id="VAA3895-164"/>&quot;mother&quot; him as if he were a child and to
            keep the creeping shadows of an unknown trouble away from him if she could. She was two
            years younger than Jack and yet it seemed to her that she was much, much older.
            &quot;I am afraid, Jack. Don&apos;t let us quarrel with our neighbor. What is
            the use? Where will it all end? Let us go back--home, Jack, shall we?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, Josephine, if you are really afraid to stay alone, I won&apos;t go
            to-day. I will wait until the next time Rosebud comes along so that she can stay with
            you. I wish she were here now or I wish that we might both go. Suppose we do. Get on
            your bonnet and we will both go. Everything went well yesterday during our absence, why
            should it not again?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Josephine, resolutely, &quot;the cattle are feeding in
            strange places and they must come home to-night. Besides,&quot; she added,
            indignantly, &quot;why should I be afraid for myself?&quot; He had meant to make
            her indignant, so he smiled at her with caressing amusement. &quot;You know that I
            am not afraid for myself. It is you, Jack. Why do they hate you so?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; said Jack, wistfully. &quot;I always thought I
            was a pretty good sort of a fel- <pb n="167" id="VAA3895-165"/>low, myself. That is
            where you erred--you people of my &apos;ain countrie.&apos; You tried to make me
            think so--you know you did--and now I have to suffer for the mistake that was not
            originally mine. For an eradicator of self-conceit, commend me to the West,
            Josephine.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Jack, why don&apos;t you ask Tom Burrington?&quot; said Josephine,
            suddenly.</p>
          <p>A shadow came into Jack&apos;s eyes and lingered there while he gazed for a long
            moment over Josephine&apos;s bright head, beyond the great yellow river with the
            arrogant push of its channel, beyond the hills with their whispering grasses, aye,
            beyond the lonely ranges themselves--away--far away--to the South.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am afraid, Josephine,&quot; he said at last, soberly, &quot;I am
            afraid that Tom knows.&quot; Then he was gone and Josephine crept back into the
            still house to wait for the long afternoon to pass so that Jack could come home
            again.</p>
          <p>It was a long afternoon and the house seemed far lonelier to-day than any other day
            when Jack had been gone. It was a listless day, too, so that there was no work that she
            seemed to want to do. Presently she left the little low room with its ghostly corners
            and insistent silence and sat on <pb n="168" id="VAA3895-166"/>the door step with a bit
            of sewing in her hands. Here, although she could not see it, it seemed that she could
            feel the solemn rushing of the water journeying southward and to-day she let herself
            drift away upon its tawny flood and dreamed the long, Summer hours through until it
            seemed true that she and Jack and no other in all the world were gliding along with the
            current, slipping away from the sinister shadows and the mocking mysteries that were
            settling down upon the valley, so that with all its wideness and all its promise one
            must choke with the creeping shadows unless one could slip away as she and Jack were
            slipping--quietly--with no one to know--out of the gloom and into the sun-shot land of
            their own people.</p>
          <p>And then Tom stopped on his way home. His mother and Louis had gone directly to the
            Seven-up from Velpen earlier in the day, but Tom had found it necessary to visit one of
            his northern line ranches and was only now on his way home. Josephine had long since
            forgotten that she had meant to sew. Now, however, she picked up the work that had
            fallen from her idle fingers and smiled to think how far away she had been, and was
            glad, when he sat down beside her on the <pb n="169" id="VAA3895-167"/>rough log door
            step, because she was not to be alone for a little while, anyway.</p>
          <p>&quot;Where is Jack?&quot; he asked, wondering why her eyes had grown so much
            sadder since he had seen her last--only yesterday.</p>
          <p>&quot;He has gone to town,&quot; she said. And then it came to her--what Jack
            had said: &quot;I am afraid Tom knows.&quot; If Tom knew, why did he not tell
            them? A vague doubt stirred in her heart. She glanced at him quickly. The gray eyes were
            looking at her steadily, full of friendliness. How strong he was! How strong he had been
            and how quick on that day when he had drawn her away from the dark water that was
            rushing and writhing under the ice. He had not faltered once nor hesitated in that great
            hour of her peril--and his. She should like to ask him if the stealing of the cow was
            all one with that supposedly wide-spread feeling against them as homesteaders, and
            whether it was an earnest of what was to come if they remained in the cattle country.
            She should like to ask him how universal was the prejudice. He would know and he could
            tell them what to do. But if he already knew, why did he not tell them? Were she and
            Jack the ones to beg the courtesy of fair dealing? Or <pb n="170" id="VAA3895-168"/>to
            force a confidence upon one who would perhaps receive it reluctantly? Her pride
            rebelled. It might be that his interests, too, demanded that they leave the country.
            Perhaps that was what Jack meant. She had never thought of that. It was strange that she
            and Jack should be considered so formidable that it was becoming necessary to send them
            into exile--they were just two lonely young people in a strange land. What did it all
            mean? Her mouth trembled, her eyes were heavy with unshed tears, so that she could not
            see to take any more stitches. The big ranch-man who had been waiting for her to break
            the silence between them was troubled.</p>
          <p>&quot;Tell me what it is that troubles you, Josephine,&quot; he said,
            gently.</p>
          <p>&quot;It is nothing,&quot; she said, making a supreme effort to control her
            emotion.</p>
          <p>He tapped his high-heeled riding boots with his whip, restlessly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Josephine,&quot; he pleaded at last, his handsome head very close to hers
            as he bent toward her, &quot;something has happened. My girl, you look heart-broken.
            You cannot hide it from me. Tell me. Let me help you if I can. Do not forget that we are
            neighbors, you and I.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="171" id="VAA3895-169"/>
          <p>&quot;I am very foolish, Mr. Burrington,&quot; she said, quietly. &quot;I
            have been worrying about Jack--just as if he could not take care of himself anywhere.
            But somehow I cannot help thinking of him as a boy all the time and fussing over him
            accordingly. He would not thank me for it, I am sure. Mr. LaDue politely stole one of
            our cows the other day and Jack naturally objected to such high-handed procedure and has
            gone up to town to see what the law can do for us and for him. There is not the least
            cause for worry. I just got to thinking.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why did you not tell me this yesterday?&quot; asked Tom, gravely.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why should you have been compelled to give ear to our little private quarrels
            when you had so much to think about that was of more importance?&quot; she
            counter-questioned. &quot;You will stay for supper?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, rising. &quot;I must go. I have been up country
            and want to get home before dark. Josephine--&quot; he began and stopped. He wanted
            to take her in his arms and make her tell him why she cried, but the proud little tilt
            to her chin restrained him. He turned quickly and was gone. Josephine was alone
            again.</p>
          <pb n="172" id="VAA3895-170"/>
          <p>The sun was getting low when she buckled on her leggings and pinned on her big hat to
            go for the cattle. The new feeding grounds for the Broken Key herd were about one mile
            distant, just beyond the big gulch which led down from the edge of the high ridge of
            hills on the west to the river, meandering somewhat up by the hills, following the line
            of least resistance, but on the bottom cutting almost squarely across the land which
            Josephine Carroll had staked out for herself. In June, when the annual rise was at its
            flood, the overflow backed up the deep, narrow ravine for some distance but seldom as
            far as the old trail, which was a relic of the days when Dakotah pony herds held sway
            and when no white man&apos;s cattle might feed on this rich land, with its
            inestimable water front, without permission of the Government. But now on this last day
            of May, the water was comparatively low and the gulch lay safe and dry from its source
            up in the hills to the very river itself. Josephine rode slowly. The sun was still above
            the broken line of the horizon-the evenings were long and light--so that there was
            little danger of darkness falling before she had her little bunch safely corralled <pb
              n="173" id="VAA3895-171"/>unless many had strayed away. She was growing used to
            the&apos;direct sun of the plains and the white glare troubled her but little these
            days, and now that the rays were yellowing and struck her slantingly, she did not mind
            them at all, but took off her wide hat and pinned it to her saddle horn. She was cooler
            so. The prairie dogs scolded her in shrill, vigorous language as she rode through their
            village, defying her smartly, only to skurry into ignominious retreat when she passed
            near them in friendly spirit, innocent alike of the intent or of the arms of war.
            Gradually, the calm of the Summer evening came to Josephine. The day was done. It was
            over, all the anger, the hurt confidence, and the vague, uneasy groping after something
            that could not be grasped, for all the groping endeavor. Jack would soon come now and
            there would be a cheery little late supper, a talk on the door step in the sweet, wide
            outdoors of the moonlit night,--and to-morrow would be a new day.</p>
          <p>The cattle had not strayed far. Neither were they of a contrary temper to-night. They
            filed across the big gulch slowly, but of one mind. Josephine hummed a snatch of a
            Southern folk <pb n="174" id="VAA3895-172"/>song happily to herself and thought of many
            things that were of little kin to the thoughts of the day that was done.</p>
          <p>Shortly before this, a man had made his way leisurely through the heavy undergrowth to
            the northern end of the island, crossed the slough, which was lower and wetter at this
            point than farther below, on a reef of rocks, entered the mouth of the gulch and
            sauntered carelessly westward. He had not progressed far, in truth the old pony trail
            lay dusty and travelworn still some distance before him, when he heard a faint sound. He
            paused, inclining his ear to the north. He had not been mistaken. The sound was plainly
            distinguishable in the hush of the early evening. He hesitated a moment. A clod of dirt,
            loosened by the touch of heavy feet, went rolling down the trail and at the same time a
            little cloud of dust arose as the vanguard of the Broken Key herd slid down the steep
            pathway. Nearer to the trail, a clump of cedars growing from the northern side made an
            excellent hiding place. But the leader of the herd was already climbing the opposite
            incline. He heard a clear, joyous, ringing cattle call and the voice that sent <pb
              n="175" id="VAA3895-173"/>it forth on the still air was a girl&apos;s voice.
            Without proceeding any farther toward the trail, he climbed half way up the bank and
            crept into the shadow of a small hollow that had been washed out by the spring rains.
            Then he waited, and presently Josephine, softly singing her mournful, sweet melody, rode
            down into the valley.</p>
          <p>The old trail was destined to be not a lonely trail that night. It was as if the ghosts
            of the dim past, of a day when the dusky habitants made history that was never written,
            had returned for one mad revel--in memoriam. Up from the south came a horseman. He rode
            rapidly, straight in his stirrups, his hat brim blown back by the violent friction with
            the air. The little dogs fairly scampered out of sight at the first beat of his
            horse&apos;s feet on their sod without even taking time to bark at him. He had seen
            the straggling line of the herd coming home and was riding to meet it. He, too, heard
            the clear, sweet call, and saw the lithe figure of the unconscious girl ride down into
            the dim valley. The sound of the voice brought a gleam into the gray eyes, the sight of
            Josephine sent the blood racing tumultuously through his veins so that he thrilled <pb
              n="176" id="VAA3895-174"/>with the glory of it. If he spurred his horse yet more, he
            would meet her just as she reached the level again.</p>
          <p>What was that thing which moved there by the hollow? Had one of the herd strayed from
            the beaten trail? Or was it some lone, gaunt timber wolf lurking near to see if a calf
            or some weakling of the herd did not drop out of the ranks and linger to its undoing?
            The rider, still on the run, threw up his arm to keep the after-glow out of his eyes,
            while he swept the darkening hollow with the keen and comprehensive sight of the men of
            the plains. Suddenly, he knew. A great sternness settled around his mouth. His eyes
            became cold and hard as steel, while the fierce desire to kill well-nigh choked him with
            its insistent clamoring to be heard. He was a very primitive man indeed in this hour
            when one spied upon the woman whom in his heart he had chosen for his own. He drew rein
            so suddenly that his well-trained cow pony settled back upon its haunches as if with the
            intuitive expectation of the feel of the tautening rope, even though he had not heard
            the little sing of it as it cut through the air. For a moment, he hesitated. What was
            the fellow&apos;s business? Why was he hiding while <pb n="177" id="VAA3895-175"
            />Josephine rode across the ravine? Who was he? And then he turned white and cold,
            sitting on his horse out there on the grassy level, with night coming on, although he
            did not feel it, did not know it then, for his nerve was never steadier, his sight never
            truer than when he raised his rifle to the level of his right shoulder and sped the
            bullet that struck down the hand in the hollow that had steadied another gun pointing
            with deadly menace up the valley. He shot twice again in rapid succession, and then his
            horse sprang forward at the cruel jab of the spurs. When he came to the edge of the
            gulch, the man was gone, gone as if the earth had swallowed him, and there was only
            Josephine in the valley. She was white of cheek and there was a startled, hunted look in
            her dark eyes. She had unconsciously dismounted and stood trembling by her
            pony&apos;s shaggy neck.</p>
          <p>&quot;He--went toward--the river,&quot; she whispered, tremulously.</p>
          <p>&quot;Who, Josephine?&quot; asked Tom, a dangerous quiet in his voice. He, too,
            dismounted and came close to her.</p>
          <p>&quot;I did n&apos;t see him. I only heard him,&quot; she answered,
            sobbingly.</p>
          <pb n="178" id="VAA3895-176"/>
          <p>&quot;Why, Josephine,&quot; said Tom, reassuringly, &quot;I did not mean to
            frighten you like this. But it was such a fine chance--or it seemed to be, rather--that
            I shot without thinking of you, I am afraid. If I had not been such a blamed bungler you
            might have had a fine skin for your floor. He was on your land, you know, so that I
            should have been in duty bound to surrender the spoils to you. I--am not used to
            missing,&quot; he continued, with an engaging smile. &quot;It hurts my pride. He
            was at ridiculously close range, too.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, what did you shoot at?&quot; demanded Josephine, in unfeigned
            surprise and relief.</p>
          <p>&quot;A big, gray wolf, bless you, who coveted one of your fat heifers,&quot;
            returned Tom, promptly. &quot;I came back to see Jack about that which you were
            telling me about this afternoon--I could not get it off my mind--and was riding to meet
            you when that pesky rascal crept across my vision and--I missed him.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I thought it was a man,&quot; said Josephine, and then, because she was
            ashamed of her unwarranted fright, she flung up her head and looked at him defiantly,
            two red spots burning in her cheeks. But something in his face made her ask,
            doubtfully:</p>
          <pb n="179" id="VAA3895-177"/>
          <p>&quot;You are not lying to me, are you?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot; No, Josephine, I am not lying--honest,&quot; he said, unsteadily.</p>
          <p>She seemed so alone there in the valley that would henceforth be a valley of shadows
            for Josephine, and she was far, far dearer to him than he had ever before dreamed, even
            when he had tried, sometimes, to think of the cow country with her gone from it. The
            effort he made not to snatch her to him, mount and ride away with her, somewhere,
            anywhere, only with her, out of the shadows, shook in his voice.</p>
          <p>&quot;Come, Josephine, let me help you mount and I will take you
            home.&quot;</p>
          <p>He held out his hand, she put her foot into it, gave a little spring and slipped into
            her saddle. But she was not yet free. His strong arms were clasped tightly around her
            and he leaned his head against her, standing thus, dumb, while real twilight crept over
            all the land and in the valley it grew quite dark. Josephine forgot to ask him why, if
            he knew, he had not told them, and, a little blindly, let her ungauntletted hand grope
            softly through his hair as he stood looking up at her.</p>
          <p>&quot;Do you love me, Josephine?&quot; he whispered.</p>
          <pb n="180" id="VAA3895-178"/>
          <p>&quot;Let me go, Tom,&quot; she said, unsteadily. &quot;We must go home.
            The cattle will stray.&quot;</p>
          <p>She tried to unclasp his hands with earnest, ineffectual fingers--so ineffectual that
            Tom laughed, suddenly caught the little struggling hands in his, laid his face upon
            them, kissed them, held them against his breast, kissed them again, then released her,
            and they rode together out of the valley.</p>

          <p><hi rend="b">&quot;I</hi>F it had been I, now,&quot; said Jack, &quot;I
            could believe that mischief was meant. But Josephine--why, what could any one have
            against Josephine? Men do not make war on women, Tom, especially without good cause--and
            what cause has that generous-hearted girl given for such deviltry? For that matter, what
            have I done? But, with or without reason, I have been literally hounded since the day of
            my arrival. Frankly speaking, I resent it. I shall continue to resent it, and that right
            smartly. Some day, when I have gained immunity, I shall demand explanation and apology.
            Meanwhile, I am biding my time. I shall not be surprised at anything that anybody may
            attempt to do to me; but I honestly think that you are mistaken about such evil intent
            towards Josephine, Tom.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Granted that men do not war on women,&quot; returned Burrington, gravely,
            &quot;what about brutes? Can you say the same of them? You did not see what I saw,
            Jack. I think you would believe what I believe if you had seen.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="182" id="VAA3895-180"/>
          <p>It was very early. Josephine, singing happily over the getting of the breakfast,
            wondered what errand had brought their neighbor of the Seven-up so early in the morning.
            Would he say anything to Jack about what had happened last night? She did not mean about
            the missing of the wolf--of course Tom would tell that--had told it last night, in all
            probability--though she could not altogether remember. It was like him to tell that on
            himself, laughingly. Men usually sure of themselves could always afford a laugh at their
            own expense. But what had happened afterward--would he say anything about that? After
            all, what had happened? She could not altogether remember.</p>
          <p>Jack was down at the woodpile splitting wood when Tom rode into the clearing. They had
            not come up to the house at all and were talking earnestly together right there at the
            woodpile, Jack leaning against a sapling, his brown face still damp and flushed from his
            recent exertion, while Tom Burrington, still mounted, though sitting with both feet on
            one side of the saddle, absently trailed the thongs of his whip over the toes of his
            riding boots. It was obviously a grave matter--that upon which their minds were bent.
              <pb n="183" id="VAA3895-181"/>Well, it was a serious situation--hers--if that was what
            engrossed their attention. How could she ever leave Jack? He was in trouble and he was
            alone but for her--and besides, she had forgotten--how easy it was, sometimes, to
            forget--did Tom Burrington know something that he ought to tell them and would not? Even
            though he himself were free of personal blame, yet if he knew and would not tell
            them-that good honor, which makes loyalty to class an obligation that high-minded men
            may not disregard, had been offended, and that offence was always unforgivable. What
            should she say when the boys came up? But the boys did not come.</p>
          <p>&quot;You did not know the man?&quot; asked Jack, thoughtfully.</p>
          <p>&quot;I did not recognize him. It was dusky in the gulch and he had disappeared
            when the smoke of my gun had lifted. Don&apos;t you think that if he had not been on
            some devil&apos;s errand he would have made his presence known? I tell you, Carroll,
            it looks bad.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Still, he might not have known that you were a peaceful and law-abiding
            citizen. You must confess that you made your advent upon the scene in rather a startling
            and belligerent man- <pb n="184" id="VAA3895-182"/>ner. I do not know anything, Tom, of
            course, but I just cannot believe that any one would want to kill Josephine. Kill
            Josephine! Why, it is a monstrous thought. I do not believe it.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Not know me? Of course he knew me! Everybody knows me, and that is not
            sounding my own praises, by any means. To be sure he knew me. Besides, I was in the
            light on the upland while he was in shadow. He could n&apos;t help but know me.
            Moreover, if he took me for a desperate character, why did he not stay and fight for
            Josephine. Tell me that, Carroll. There is n&apos;t a man on the Seven-up who would
            sneak away and leave a Dakotah Indian woman in danger under such circumstances, let
            alone a white woman. I tell you, you must take Josephine South or else give
            her--&quot;</p>
          <p>He stopped short, while involuntarily his eyes sought and found the open doorway of the
            cabin where the figure of a girl passed once in a while and sometimes glanced his way.
            Jack did not notice the significance of the pause.</p>
          <p>&quot;I never thought of that,&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, why did he run
            from you and why did he run from Josephine? I don&apos;t know what to do, Tom. If I
            take her South, that means a general <pb n="185" id="VAA3895-183"/>break-up. She would
            not stay there unless I gave up my hold here and stayed with her. I should have to tell
            her the reason for her going back--part of it, at least--so she would never consent to
            my coming back here. I know Josephine--and there are only we two, you know. I cannot
            afford to give up. We have risked too much to pick up and leave it all--except of
            necessity. Of course, if what you say is true, I shall not hesitate a moment to take her
            away; but it is so hard to believe and I am much disposed to stay and find out for
            myself what it all means. I shall not leave Josephine alone again,&quot; he drew
            himself up a little proudly, &quot;so there is no cause for worry on that score.
            Until I ascertain the meaning of the deviltry that seems to be in the air, I shall not
            let Josephine out of my sight. You may rest assured of that. If it is as you say, I
            shall then take Josephine South and come back and put the snake-in-the-grass where his
            fangs won&apos;t count for much any more.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You will do as you think best, of course,&quot; said Burrington,
            perceiving by the younger man&apos;s attitude that the subject was closed.
            &quot;By the way, Carroll,&quot; he continued, casually, &quot;that was not
            my only object in coming to see you this <pb n="186" id="VAA3895-184"/>morning. I had
            two axes to grind, in fact. How would you feel about taking a little excursion up into
            the Westover country? I need a man and you are just the kind I want--all grit and nerve.
            Josephine could stay with mother, you know, and I&apos;d send a boy over to look
            after your stock. What do you say?&quot;</p>
          <p>Jack hesitated just a moment--for Josephine&apos;s sake; but when he thought of
            that February storm and of Tom Burrington&apos;s part in it, all doubt as to his
            course left him immediately.</p>
          <p>&quot;I say that I am your man with all my heart,&quot; said the boy from the
            South, promptly. &quot;You have found yourself a loser?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;To the tune of seventeen head of as fine horses as run on this side Old
            Muddy. They are the home ranging kind, too, and yet I have scoured the whole near
            country for them--rode two days and could not get wind of them at all until last night
            late--heard then that some one had seen them up near Westover. Now that means foul play,
            of course--home horses do not find themselves away up at Westover--unless they are
            native to the soil or are helped there--one of the two. Horses, as you probably know, do
            not wander like cattle. It will not be a pleas- <pb n="187" id="VAA3895-185"/>ure party
            by any means, Jack, and I shall not be at all hurt if you decline to go. Now please do
            not go dignified so quickly. No one doubts your nerve. I was thinking of
            Josephine.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;She need not know our errand,&quot; interrupted Josephine&apos;s
            brother, with convincing brevity. &quot;As for the rest, according to your own
            theory, she is safer surely at the Seven-up than at the Broken Key.&quot;</p>
          <p>It had come to him, suddenly, illuminatingly, who it was that Burrington suspected and
            that the quest might not be for horses alone, but one in which Tom Burrington knew that
            he, Jack, would be with him heart and soul. Perhaps--the thought brought out stern lines
            of determination about the boyish mouth--perhaps the time was come when, as he had said,
            &quot;the snake-in-the-grass would be put where his fangs would not count for much
            any more.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Then you are with me?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Do we start this morning?&quot; asked John Calhoun Carroll, calmly.</p>
          <p>It was early twilight when they rode silently up to the corral at Dave Myers&apos;s
            ranch on White River. They were seeking refreshment and lodging for the night after
            almost a full day in <pb n="188" id="VAA3895-186"/>the saddle. They had been following a
            pretty well defined trail by rumor for some time, but had lately lost it. It was folly
            to ride a blind trail by night. Dave was a good fellow and would give them the best
            accommodation he could. They would just turn their horses in with the rest before going
            to the house. There was no doubt in the world of Myers&apos;s hospitality. There
            seemed to be no one about the place. The house wore a deserted look. Still, that could
            make no difference in their arrangements. They should simply enter unbidden, cook some
            supper, and then rest their tired bodies on the object which looked the most like a bed
            among the half-breed&apos;s heterogeneous collection of makeshift house
            furnishings.</p>
          <p>&quot;Good horses he &apos;s got,&quot; said Jack, drawing rein at the
            gate.</p>
          <p>A short silence followed, during which Jack stretched his wearied limbs and longed
            heartily with the longing of a hungry boy for the supper that had yet to be
            prepared.</p>
          <p>&quot;He has, indeed,&quot; assented Tom, at last, grimly. &quot;You never
            see that brand on any other kind. I for one do not challenge his taste. The trouble is
            that the owner of that brand is not <pb n="189" id="VAA3895-187"/>the only good judge of
            horseflesh in this country.&quot;</p>
          <p>Jack emitted a low whistle of surprise and then said, with untroubled serenity:
            &quot;Well, I am right glad to find the trail again.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You are a brick, dear boy,&quot; was the older man&apos;s only
            response as he slipped from his horse and proceeded calmly to relieve him of saddle and
            bridle. This accomplished, he opened the gate and sent the horse in to rest among his
            one-time mates.</p>
          <p>&quot;Is n&apos;t this high-handed procedure a trifle risky?&quot; asked
            Jack, following suit with ready adaptability to the lead of the chief.</p>
          <p>&quot;I have not an idea at just what point the pesky rascals may decide to return
            to gloat over their lucky haul. A Seven-up concealed in the bushes would not strike them
            exactly in the light of a white flag of truce, I am thinking; and I imagine that a
            Broken Key would not have the effect of soothing syrup, either. It will be too dark to
            notice the difference in the bunch.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You are evidently not thinking seriously of quietly driving the bunch home
            now in order to save all further trouble,&quot; said Jack, with a smile.</p>
          <pb n="190" id="VAA3895-188"/>
          <p>&quot;Such a thought is certainly not weighting me down at present,&quot; said
            Tom, leading the way to the house. &quot;It seems to me that I should kind of like
            to know who it is that has such an uncontrolled hankering after the fleshpots of the
            Seven-up. Not Dave Myers--I doubt if he knows anything about this. Would n&apos;t
            you like to know, too, Jack?&quot; he concluded, with a peculiar significance.</p>
          <p>&quot;That I would,&quot; agreed Jack, heartily, his blood tingling with the
            lust of conflict.</p>
          <p>&quot;And besides,&quot; continued Tom, calmly, &quot;I counted only ten. I
            want my other seven.&quot;</p>
          <p>They took no extraordinary precaution to conceal their presence. In truth, it was not
            many minutes before a cheerful fire was rumbling in the rusty stove and the smoke of it
            was curling up into the slowly coming darkness of the summer night. While Jack, with the
            sure instinct of healthy hunger, peered into likely places for flour and cured meat and
            coffee, the more practical Tom fed the fire and put the skillet on to heat for the
            flapjacks it devolved upon him to make.</p>
          <p>&quot;If they see our fire, they will only think that Dave has returned,&quot;
            he remarked, casually, to <pb n="191" id="VAA3895-189"/>his companion, &quot;and
            they are evidently counting on Dave&apos;s not talking if he does come back, so what
            is to hinder our having a fine supper? I for one am fairly starved.&quot;</p>
          <p>At that moment, the door was quietly opened and a boy entered the room. He seemed not
            older than twelve years and his thin face went haggard with a child&apos;s dread as
            he saw who it was that so unconcernedly sifted flour over there by the table.</p>
          <p>&quot;I thought--they had come back,&quot; he faltered, standing with his back
            to the door, his hand nervously clasping the latch string behind him.</p>
          <p>&quot;Who?&quot; asked Tom, indifferently, mixing dough as if everything else
            in all the world was of little worth as compared with this work upon which he was
            bent.</p>
          <p>&quot;I--I--das&apos;n&apos;t tell,&quot; said the boy. &quot;He
            &apos;d kill me if I told.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Who would kill you, little chap?&quot; asked Tom, gently, thinking of
            another boy who was about this waif&apos;s age and who was very close indeed to the
            heart of the elder brother.</p>
          <p>&quot;He would. I--das&apos;n&apos;t tell.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, never mind. You need n&apos;t tell, little <pb n="192"
              id="VAA3895-190"/>chap, if you don&apos;t want to. You are called the White Slave
            hereabouts, are you not?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said the boy miserably.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, I do,&quot; said the ranchman, with a sigh. &quot;Boy, do you
            know me?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Then do just as I tell you to-night, and--you shall not be called the White
            Slave any longer. Do you understand?&quot;</p>
          <p>The boy shook his head.</p>
          <p>&quot;Listen then. It is I who have the upper hand now. You see that,
            don&apos;t you? You will do well to serve me to-night. In fact, boy, you had better!
            When--he--comes back, do his bidding, but say nothing about us. You understand that
            much? Well, make your choice.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think he will come to-night,&quot; said the boy, after a
            short silence. &quot;I don&apos;t think any one will come back before three
            o&apos;clock. That&apos;s why I could n&apos;t understand the
            smoke.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t lie to me!&quot; cried Tom, sternly. &quot;Tell me the
            truth. How many are there?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Who is the leader?&quot;</p>
          <pb n="193" id="VAA3895-191"/>
          <p>&quot;I--das&apos;n&apos;t tell.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, he &apos;s the one who &apos;d kill you, is he? Why are
            n&apos;t you looking for him to-night?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot; &apos;Cause he &apos;s gone.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I das&apos;n&apos;t tell.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Then the devil take you,&quot; exclaimed Tom, in exasperation.</p>
          <p>&quot;My boy,&quot; put in Jack, quietly, &quot;if you will tell me the
            truth, you will not have to work for these men any longer. I do not think you quite
            understood Mr. Burrington. Come here. Poor kid! You have no father or mother, have you?
            I thought not. Neither have I. Would n&apos;t you like to live at the Broken Key? I
            need some one to herd my cattle. You would never have to come back here, and--there are
            no &quot;white slaves&quot; at the Broken Key. If you will tell me where your
            master is and where the rest of Mr. Burrington&apos;s horses are and when any one is
            expected back here, you can go away with me in the morning and you can stay with me
            for--always, if you like. It is as Mr. Burrington says--we have the upper hand now, but
            your answering my questions may prevent bloodshed. Won&apos;t you tell
            me?&quot;</p>
          <pb n="194" id="VAA3895-192"/>
          <p>The White Slave stared at him with dilating eyes. &quot;Are you the man he calls
            Carroll?&quot; he stammered.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, he--he--&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said Jack, &quot;that he hates me--that is, if we
            are talking about the same man, and I think we are. He hates Mr. Burrington, too. But
            what difference does that make between you and me?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, I won&apos;t tell his name,&quot; said the boy, with
            superstitious stubbornness. &quot;He&apos;d hear it, someway, all right. He
            &apos;d know I told. He knows everything.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Where is he now?&quot; asked Jack, quietly. &quot;You will tell me,
            won&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know where he is. He said he was going to the dugout. If you
            know where that is, you know more than I do. He took some horses with him.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You are sure you don&apos;t know where the dugout is?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know--honest. They never tell me their
            secrets.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;When did he start?&quot;</p>
          <pb n="195" id="VAA3895-193"/>
          <p>&quot;At sun-down.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;By Jove!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;If we &apos;d only been a
            half-hour earlier!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;What direction did he go?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;He crossed White River.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;And when are the other fellows coming back?&quot; asked Jack, with a
            keen, though veiled glance at the boy.</p>
          <p>&quot;They said three o&apos;clock,&quot; persisted the boy, &quot;but
            they crossed White River, too, and I don&apos;t think they intend to come back until
            to-morrow.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;What are you doing here, then, if you are not expecting them?&quot;
            demanded Tom, suspiciously.</p>
          <p>&quot;None o&apos; your business,&quot; returned the White Slave, sullenly.
            He was afraid of the big ranch-man of the Seven-up.</p>
          <p>&quot;Tell me, my boy,&quot; said Jack, gently.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, I was to watch if anybody came. But they was n&apos;t
            lookin&apos; for no one to come. And I was to be here to feed their horses when they
            did come and cook &apos;em some grub--if I wanted to keep my liver,&quot; said
            the boy, with evident unwillingness.</p>
          <p>&quot;I know what I am going to do,&quot; exclaimed Tom, suddenly and
            determinedly. &quot;I &apos;m going <pb n="196" id="VAA3895-194"/>to run down
            the boss of this little affair. If the boy is telling the truth, no one will come back
            here for a day or two at least. It is not likely they would cross White River twice in a
            night unless there was something pressing. White River is up. I am no good at a waiting
            game; anyway. If the boy is lying, we &apos;ll string him up. Will you go or stay,
            Jack? I think it would be just as well perhaps for you to stay and watch the premises.
            Some one might come back, after all, and you could hide in the bushes and report to the
            officers to-morrow--if I don&apos;t get back. But we &apos;ll both go if you say
            the word.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You&apos;d better both go,&quot; advised the White Slave,
            shortly.</p>
          <p>&quot;You &apos;re such a cheerful liar, you know,&quot; said Tom, calmly,
            &quot;that we &apos;ll just do as we please.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I reckon I &apos;ll stay,&quot; said Jack, quietly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Good. If I don&apos;t strike any trail, I&apos;ll be back by three
            o&apos;clock. Don&apos;t take any risks. We &apos;re only scouting now, you
            know, and it&apos;s so infernally dark. Keep an eye on the kid. So
            long.&quot;</p>
          <p>He slipped out and was gone.</p>
          <p>&quot;Will you do just as I say?&quot; asked Jack, turning to the boy.</p>
          <pb n="197" id="VAA3895-195"/>
          <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the boy, with grateful submissiveness. &quot;I will
            mind you, Mr. Jack Carroll. Are you goin&apos; to hide in the bushes like Mr.
            Burrington said?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Jack, a fighting smile on his lips and a gleam in his
            eyes, &quot;I am not going to hide in the bushes like Mr. Burrington
            said.&quot;</p>
          <p>It was late when the muffled sound of unhurried horses&apos; hoofs drifted into the
            quiet room where Jack Carroll waited for the coming of some one, his blood cooled with
            the wearisome and indefinite delay. He had begun to think that Tom had been right, after
            all. He slouched back in his chair and listened sleepily to the frantic whirring of a
            lumbering June bug on the wing and the subsequent dull thud of its foolish contact with
            the wall. The light had been removed to an inner room and the kitchen was in complete
            darkness. The White Slave crouched by the window but faintly outlined by the darkness
            within. There seemed something of stealth in the approaching hoof-beats--perhaps because
            of the lateness of the hour, the stillness of all else, and because the sound was not a
            running nor a braggart sound. The steps came nearer-stopped; then startlingly close,
            grimly amusing be- <pb n="198" id="VAA3895-196"/>cause of its unconsciousness, a deep
            yawn drifted in through the window and sounded as loudly in the room as if it had
            originated there. The care-free, unthinking act was closely and harshly followed,
            however, by the firing in rapid succession of two pistol shots. The White Slave made no
            move. He seemed incapable of action until a slight shove from Jack&apos;s foot
            warned him and he rose and slipped out into the night.</p>
          <p>&quot;It&apos;s a wonder you would n&apos;t take your time,&quot;
            grumbled the man on the horse, with rough. sarcasm. &quot;I &apos;m dead for
            sleep. Here you are. Give him good water and good feed if you want your liver left
            whole!&quot;</p>
          <p>There was the sound of an opening door. The faintest light of which a cloudless,
            moonless but starlit summer night is capable of giving crept in, while outside the
            ineffectual lamps of the fireflies gleamed and darkened softly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Hell!&quot; The man still talked to the boy, who was already beyond
            hearing. &quot;It&apos;s as dark as the inside of a cow. Why the devil did
            n&apos;t you leave that light in the kitchen?&quot;</p>
          <p>He stumbled across the room to the streak of yellow that ran along the floor and threw
            open the door leading into the lighted room beyond. <pb n="199" id="VAA3895-197"/>The
            hand was a heavy one that came down on his shoulder at that moment, so that he turned
            squarely upon command and threw up his hands, however grudgingly, because there was
            nothing else to do when he felt the cold steel pressing against his neck. The boy had
            played fair. He had not told.</p>
          <p>&quot;You did that right well, Mr. Horse-thief,&quot; said Jack, approvingly.
            &quot;A clean surrender--no fuss or sloppiness of any kind. Very good. I approve of
            you.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Damn!&quot; said the man, shortly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Did Frank LaDue go directly to the stable?&quot; asked Jack,
            carelessly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Suppose you go and see for yourself,&quot; growled the captive,
            sullenly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Certainly, with all the pleasure in the world,&quot; said Jack, readily.
            &quot;You just rest quietly as you are for a minute or two while I borrow your guns
            and things, will you? I &apos;ll take the belt, too, if you don&apos;t mind.
            Now, don&apos;t be too promiscuous with your hands, please. Just a minute while I
            make a record tie with my rope. Hold your hands close to your sides,&quot; demanded
            Jack, sternly.</p>
          <p>There was no mistaking his intention should <pb n="200" id="VAA3895-198"/>there be an
            offensive move on the part of the outlaw. The sullen horse-thief, swearing softly all
            the while, nevertheless submitted to be bound hand and foot and rolled into a
            corner.</p>
          <p>&quot;All right?&quot; asked Jack, finally. &quot;If you are ready, I
            reckon I&apos;ll be movin&apos; on.&quot;</p>
          <p>He nodded to his prisoner, opened the door and passed out. All was still. There was
            nothing to be heard but the strident frog chorus from the river yonder. Presently, as he
            paused a moment, listening, he thought he heard a sound that he knew over by the
            corral--the low, expectant, grateful whinny of a hungry horse that sees his long delayed
            supper coming at last. He walked swiftly towards the corral, keeping well in the
            shadows.</p>
          <p>&quot;Throw up your hands,&quot; he cried, suddenly, in a low authoritative
            voice, to a dark shape just emerging from the corral. The hands went up while a
            plaintive voice expostulated:</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, is that you, Mr. Carroll? What you got agin me? I ain&apos;t never
            done nothin&apos; to you.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, do something for me now,&quot; said Jack, curtly. &quot;Make
            for the house and be quick about it. Keep your hands up, please, until I relieve you of
            your playthings. Now, then, hurry, will <pb n="201" id="VAA3895-199"/>you? I have an
            engagement with Frank LaDue to-night that I want to keep, so step along lively,
            please.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You&apos;ve got a long ride before you, have n&apos;t you?&quot;
            vouchsafed the prisoner, sociably.</p>
          <p>&quot;Not so long as it might be,&quot; said Jack, with brief significance, as
            they entered the house where the first sullen captive lay, grinding his teeth in
            helpless rage over the shame of this wholesale capture by one man--and him a pilgrim
            from a far-away country. The second took the affair more philosophically and grinned
            impudently into the homesteader&apos;s face. He, too, submitted without further
            fight. It was an ugly-looking gun, that, and he did not like the look in the young
            Southerner&apos;s eyes, and besides, down deep in his heart, he was a coward.</p>
          <p>Again, Jack left the room. Were there others of the gang still hanging about the
            premises or were there others yet to come? Was Frank LaDue concerned in this nefarious
            incident? He steadfastly believed so. He strode toward the dark pile of the stable
            without his former wariness. He had been so successful thus far that his buoyant spirits
            could harbor no depressing premonition of a possible reverse of fortune. It <pb n="202"
              id="VAA3895-200"/>had all been so ridiculously easy. Pure luck had played into his
            hands. He was almost ashamed of its tameness. He meant, however, to probe this affair to
            the foundation of it all. He should wring a complete confession from some one or all of
            these men if he had to resort to some torture process of mediævalism. To-night should
            determine for them whether or not this secret organization which he and Burrington had
            run down was in any way in league with that diabolical attempt at Josephine&apos;s
            life. For despite his skepticism, there lurked, down deep in his heart, the awful fear
            that what Burrington believed might be true, after all.</p>
          <p>There was a sudden, sharp report, and a bullet went hurtling by him with an ominous
            sing and hiss. Though untouched, he dropped, grateful to the kindly darkness that made a
            man prone on mother earth of little worth as a target. He lay perfectly still for a
            moment, wondering what effect the unexpected shot would have upon the White Slave, but
            trusting to his good judgment not to squeal regardless of any little gun play there
            might be. Or had the boy already told? Perhaps, nay probably, this was the arch-thief of
            all and the boy&apos;s fear of his master had been <pb n="203" id="VAA3895-201"
            />stronger than his promises to Jack. He had as yet seen nothing, but the shot had come
            from the direction of the barn, so that he was between the enemy and the house. It was a
            good advantage. The gods had surely been with him this night. He strained his sight
            houseward. If the outlaw knew that his comrades were prisoners there, he might not
            readily accept an opportunity for escape. Their brotherhood was a right loyal one. If he
            knew! Did he know? Jack began creeping back toward the house. Suddenly, a stream of
            light poured out into the night as the door was unexpectedly opened and the White Slave
            stumbled into the kitchen. But his was not the only figure thus revealed. In the outer
            circle of light loomed up the sinister outlines of a man to whose greedy gaze stood now
            unveiled the picture of the whole situation and he saw with understanding. But Jack saw,
            too, and comprehended more quickly because there was nothing in it new to him but the
            figure daubed on in the foreground, so that while there were two explosions, his was
            first and went home, while the second went far astray and was lost. It was thus Jack
            fulfilled his obligation to the White Slave. He did not doubt that the outlaw&apos;s
              <pb n="204" id="VAA3895-202"/>bullet was meant to end the life of the child who had
            told.</p>
          <p>&quot;You&apos;ve got us, Carroll,&quot;,said the last captive, lying white
            and spent upon Dave Myers&apos;s bed, after his enemy had stanched the flow of blood
            from his shoulder. &quot;Now what are you goin&apos; to do with
            us?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know you, although you are pretty familiar with my
            name,&quot; said Jack, gravely. &quot;Did you know that your den had been
            raided?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I sort o&apos; suspected,&quot; said the man, with a sour grin,
            &quot;when I made out your slim shanks comin&apos; towards me. So when I missed
            you, I made for the house just to investigate sort o&apos;, you know. I did
            n&apos;t know then that I&apos;d missed you plum but I was afraid to go very
            close to you for fear you were playin&apos; &apos;possum. Good Lord! If
            I&apos;d a only knowed there was only you, a scrawny, white-livered, stiff collar
            feller! A tenderfoot! A milk and honey boy! Damn! I supposed o&apos; course Tom
            Burrington was in here and a whole carload o&apos; off&apos;cers. I thought
            I&apos;d peek in at the winder and see what was goin&apos; on when the kid here
            saved me the trouble by openin&apos; the door.&quot; He glared at the cowering
            boy, malevolently.</p>
          <pb n="205" id="VAA3895-203"/>
          <p>&quot;What made you, kid?&quot; asked Jack, gravely.</p>
          <p>&quot;I was afraid o&apos; the shootin&apos;,&quot; said the White
            Slave, whimpering. &quot;I wanted to get under the bed. But I did n&apos;t tell
            on you, honest I did n&apos;t.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, never mind. There is just the one thing that I want to know of
            you,&quot; said Jack, turning once more to the wounded man, &quot;the rest you
            had better keep to tell to the officers; but what I want to know won&apos;t
            keep.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Fire ahead.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Is Frank LaDue mixed up in this affair?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;That &apos;s none o&apos; your business,&quot; responded the
            prisoner, insolently.</p>
          <p>&quot;I wish you would tell me,&quot; said Jack, earnestly, &quot;and tell
            me now--to-night. It is a matter of life or death. Where is he now and how does he
            work?&quot;</p>
          <p>The man laughed.</p>
          <p>&quot;That&apos;s easy. I don&apos;t know where he is now and he works
            like--a coward.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Was he with you to-night?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Now, look here, young feller; nobody&apos;s been infringin&apos; on
            your property rights, have they? Why don&apos;t you wait until your own ox is
            gored?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Somebody certainly has been infringing upon my property rights, but leaving
            that out of the <pb n="206" id="VAA3895-204"/>question now, what I must know to-night
            is, as I told you before, a matter of life or death.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, then, you can stop pesterin&apos; yourself about that. Everybody
            knows that Frank LaDue &apos;s a coward. And after to-night, I can tell him he
            &apos;d better be a-takin&apos; some notice o&apos; you instead o&apos;
            countin&apos; so much on intimidatin&apos; you. You need never worry about him
            shootin&apos;, though. He&apos;d be afraid o&apos; the dark afterwards.
            I&apos;m only tellin&apos; you what everybody knows. But he &apos;s a great
            bluffer, Frank LaDue is. He might plug your keyhole, for instance, but he&apos;d
            never follow it up. He steals from small owners and homesteaders and Injuns. He
            ain&apos;t got the courage to tackle big concerns--usually. The Injuns hate him like
            pizen and I look for trouble now most any day in that direction, and so far as I can
            read human nature, he don&apos;t love you none, nor that Seven-up fellow, neither.
            But if he has ever worked with me in anything you will never know it. The law&apos;s
            got me at last but I reckon I can keep my mouth shut about other fellers. Are you
            satisfied? I would n&apos;t have talked half so much to any other man, but you--are
            such a comical little slim-shanks to make such a haul as three big lubbers like us. I
            can&apos;t help <pb n="207" id="VAA3895-205"/>laughin&apos;--but I&apos;m
            through now.&quot; He closed his mouth stubbornly and turned to the wall. He could
            not be persuaded to speak again.</p>
          <p>The next morning, early, Tom Burrington returned unsuccessful in both his man and horse
            hunt. Mingled with his honest admiration of his tenderfoot friend&apos;s fine
            showing for his night&apos;s work was much astonishment and not a little chagrin.
            The two men started at once for Westover with their prisoners, where the latter were
            given into the keeping of the deputy marshal. They waived examination before the United
            States Commissioner, were bound over to appear at the next regular term of the United
            States Court at Deadwood, and then Tom and Jack and the little White Slave drove the
            stolen band of horses home. The real quest of both men had been in vain. This thought
            stayed with Tom throughout all the long, dusty way, that a thousand horses gone astray
            could not have taken him so far from Josephine in her hour of danger had he not been so
            sure that he was about Josephine&apos;s business. One of the outlaws had said that
            LaDue was too much of a coward to shoot. Was not shooting a coward&apos;s game?</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
          <head>THE TRAGEDY AT THE HOMESTEAD</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">N</hi>OTHING of an unusual nature had occurred during the absence of the
            two men. Tom&apos;s mother, acting upon an earnest hint from her big, gray-eyed son
            who had grown so much more thoughtful and reserved in the year that was just past, and
            who, since two short days ago, had grown infinitely older, had contrived to keep her
            guest contented within doors most of the time--an act deserving of much credit, for the
            girl loved with a great love the wide outdoors.</p>
          <p>&quot;We spent such a lazy day yesterday,&quot; confessed Josephine, smilingly.
            &quot;First we made gingerbread men, Louis and I, a whole battalion, thanks to Mrs.
            Burrington, who was generous with the dough. Then we sewed and sang and read and talked
            about you when you were a little boy, and about Jack when he was a little boy, and about
            Louis when he was a little--baby; and this morning,--now what do you suppose we did this
            morning?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I never could guess,&quot; said Tom, wondering <pb n="209"
              id="VAA3895-207"/>how he ever thought for a moment that Josephine ought to go away
            when here in his house by the side of his stately, gray-haired mother, she was so safe
            and merry and seemingly content--so dear a household spirit. Could not he, Tom
            Burrington, accounted in the range country a man of more than ordinary strength both
            physical and of the will, protect and hold what was his own? He laughed, looking at her
            thus, to think that he had ever thought that he could let her go. She should come to his
            house and to him and then let all the world watch out.</p>
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t tell, Josephine,&quot; urged Louis. &quot;He does
            n&apos;t deserve to know. He&apos;ll just let &apos;em freeze
            again.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, you have told yourself, chum,&quot; laughed Josephine, merrily.
            &quot;Besides, anybody could tell by the sunburn on your nose and the freckles on
            mine that we had been out in the sun all the morning. Well, I will tell you, though, as
            Louis says, you do not either of you deserve to know. While your mother was getting
            those pretty slips ready to take the place of the plants that froze last Winter all on
            account of somebody&apos;s unappreciative carelessness, Louis and I went down to our
            garden and hoed potatoes all the morning <pb n="210" id="VAA3895-208"/>and weeded the
            onion bed, and if you do not think of me and of my poor blistered hands every time you
            taste a potato of the future, you will be an ungrateful wretch and we shall never
            forgive you, shall we, Louis?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I do not see any blisters, my fine lady,&quot; said Tom, interestedly.
            &quot;I have you. You wore gloves. She did--did n&apos;t she,
            Louis?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Ask her. How should I know?&quot; said the boy, loyally. &quot;Do you
            expect a fellow to be for always on the look-out to see whether his women-folks wear
            gloves or not? Life&apos;s too short.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I should think that you could see for yourself,&quot; said Josephine,
            holding out her hands for inspection. They were not very large hands and they were very
            white, and Tom, not daring to touch them, but feeling the hot blood burn his face with
            the desire of it, asked abruptly:</p>
          <p>&quot;You did n&apos;t go down to the far garden, did you?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You bet we did,&quot; said Louis, stoutly. &quot;Charlie Mason has
            n&apos;t been able to do a thing down there and it needed fixin&apos; mighty
            bad. So Josephine and I worked down there all the morning and this afternoon
            I&apos;m going to teach her <pb n="211" id="VAA3895-209"/>to shoot my rifle to pay
            her for working in my garden.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I could n&apos;t help it, Tom,&quot; explained the mother,
            apologetically, as she saw the sternness creeping over the handsome face. &quot;She
            would go this morning in spite of me. They took hold of hands, the silly children, and
            just ran away from me. I could not go myself because I did not know where they went, and
            besides, I had bread in the oven.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why should I not go to the garden?&quot; asked Josephine, in troubled
            surprise. And Tom, looking long and deep into her clear, questioning eyes, did not dare
            to tell her why. The shadow of a great unrest fell over his face. He wished in that
            moment that he had asked her of Jack, yesterday, down by the wood-pile--was it only
            yesterday?--when the words of his great desire had trembled upon his lips and would have
            been spoken had he not choked them back because he knew so well that Jack would never
            give her up while this mysterious evil menaced her. But perhaps if he had tried hard
            enough, he might have convinced Jack of the entire wisdom of such a course. He wished he
            had tried. He wished he had spoken to Jack on <pb n="212" id="VAA3895-210"/>the way home
            from Westover. Jack almost believed what the horse-thief had said about LaDue&apos;s
            art of bluffing. Yet he had known that it would not be worth while to speak, then,
            because, while Jack almost believed the horse-thief&apos;s rough reading of the
            islander&apos;s character and intentions, he did not believe it--altogether, and Tom
            knew that Jack Carroll would never listen to his or any man&apos;s suit until the
            question was settled one way or the other. He might even, and probably would, only bring
            about a loss of fellowship by his undue haste. He knew all of this well, and yet--if
            Jack only would! Yes, why not? Why should Josephine not go to the garden--to his garden?
            If she could not, if the very thought of it brought the cold damp to his forehead, then
            indeed was the time come when she must go away. His dream had been the idle dream of a
            fool&apos;s paradise.</p>
          <p>&quot;There is no reason at all why you should not go,&quot; he answered,
            quietly, &quot;except that a regular den of rattle-snakes infests that locality. You
            must promise me that you will never go away down there alone.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I should think that it would be a very simple matter to kill all those
            rattle-snakes,&quot; said Jose- <pb n="213" id="VAA3895-211"/>phine, unsuspiciously.
            &quot;If I were a man, I should do it. I should think you would be afraid for Louis.
            What with wolves and rattle-snakes, I very plainly foresee an exciting, if hampered,
            future for Josephine Carroll. Yes, I promise, if you will trust Louis and his gun to me
            this afternoon,&quot; she bargained. &quot;He complains that the stern, elder
            brother never lets him take his gun out unless attended by this same tyrant. I will send
            him safely home in the morning. Is it a bargain?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;It is a bargain,&quot; agreed Tom.</p>
          <p>Shortly after noon of that same day, having first sent the White Slave out with the
            cattle, Jack was planting and harrowing corn in a field long neglected because of his
            inability to get help. He kept doggedly at the task all through the long, hot afternoon,
            while Josephine and her young guest amused themselves near by with shooting at humps of
            turned-over sod for targets, or bunches of soap-weed. Sometimes they tried their luck at
            a flock of visiting blackbirds, having no intention of really hitting anything that was
            alive. Indeed, they would have been sorely remorseful had a feathered and make-belief
            target inadvertently fallen. At least, Josephine would <pb n="214" id="VAA3895-212"
            />have been, and the boy was bound in honor to support the views of his pretty young
            hostess on this day when he was not only her guest but her sworn protector as well. Tom
            had said so and it meant something when Tom spoke. How he listened and longed for the
            warning rattle of a snake so that he might prove his position as not honorary only, but
            urgently active as well. He even threshed through the prairie grass with his chubby and
            rubber-booted legs in the vain hope of surprising the enemy in his lair, never dreaming
            of failure to kill.</p>
          <p>When the shadows of the trees had stretched themselves near halfway across the river,
            when the sun hung over the western hills and shone with a yellower light, when the frogs
            began chanting their raucous monotones, when the meadow lark&apos;s liquid notes had
            taken on a plaintive tone and the &quot;bob white&quot; of the quail, calling to
            his brooding mate, came sleepily from grass coverts, and the soft, heart-breaking lament
            of the mourning dove floated with penetrating sweetness from the depths of the island
            forest, when, if one listened, one could hear the deep, steady push of the river,
            Josephine waved a cheery good-bye to the laborer in the field, who <pb n="215"
              id="VAA3895-213"/>held his hat high to honor the passing of the blue-ginghamed figure,
            held out her hand to the boy, and the two strolled leisurely homeward to prepare the
            evening meal for the man who must work while yet there was light.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am tired, Josephine, dead tired,&quot; said Jack, after supper. He sat
            down on the threshold and leaned his head wearily against the door-casing. It was a
            characteristic attitude of his that Spring and Summer when he was tired or thoughtful.
            His eyes were lifted to the hilltops, as they had so often been before, where the light
            yet lingered, although dusk had come to the valley.</p>
          <p>&quot;Poor boy,&quot; comforted Josephine. &quot;You work far too hard. It
            was n&apos;t fair of Mr. Burrington to keep you up all last night, either. Was it,
            Louis?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;No, I suppose not, only I do wish I had been there, too,&quot; sighed the
            boy. &quot;Gee! Maybe Jack would have let me take their guns away from
            &apos;em,--maybe. What &apos;ll you bet? Would n&apos;t you, Jack? Because
            there was n&apos;t a speck of danger. You had the drop on &apos;em all the time,
            you know.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;But where the fun without any danger at all?&quot; laughed Jack.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, of course,&quot; qualified the boy, &quot;they <pb n="216"
              id="VAA3895-214"/>might have drawn so quickly as to hurt me even if you had killed
            &apos;em afterwards. Say, Jack, I wish you&apos;d let me work for you.
            I&apos;m a bully hand at makin&apos; garden and tendin&apos; to stock. You
            just ask Tom. And I could learn to plough and cultivate corn and things. I&apos;d
            love to. Maybe if you needed me, and Josephine, too, mummy would let me stay out here
            all Winter. I hate to go back to that old Chicago and that old school now that I know
            you and Josephine. Josephine makes the best biscuits I ever ate in my life. Mummy says
            it &apos;s because she was born in the South. She says you get a knack by being born
            down there. I wish our old cook had gone down there to be born. Josephine, are you going
            to have sour milk batter cakes for breakfast? I like &apos;em even better than
            biscuits for breakfast--when you make &apos;em,&quot; he concluded,
            diplomatically.</p>
          <p>&quot;Thanks, old chap,&quot; said Jack, a laugh in his eyes, &quot;but now
            that I have the White Slave to help around, I won&apos;t need your labor. However,
            you are dead welcome to stay here all the time if you like. By the way, I wonder what
            keeps the boy? It &apos;s away past milking time. Any mail, Josephine?&quot;</p>
          <pb n="217" id="VAA3895-215"/>
          <p>&quot;Lots of it,&quot; said Josephine, interestedly. &quot;The home
            papers, and letters, too, and the magazines, and I have n&apos;t read a word. Was
            n&apos;t I good to wait for you? Charlie Mason, that Seven-up cowboy, you know, went
            to town early this morning and he said he would bring our mail. Shall I light the lamp
            and read the news to you?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Please,&quot; said Jack, yawning. &quot;It seems a shame to have a
            light this fine evening, but we shall have to have the news, I suspect.&quot;</p>
          <p>Josephine arose, lighted a lamp, set it upon the table, leisurely drew up a chair, sat
            down and slipped a finger through the wrapping of a newspaper. Opposite, chin in hand,
            elbows on the table, sat the boy Louis, prepared to give his earnest attention to the
            reading of the news of a far-away country.</p>
          <p>&quot;Do you want to do something for me first, Louis?&quot; asked Jack.
            &quot;Just bring me a basin of cold water, will you? My poor feet burn like sixty.
            They are not exactly at home yet in plough shoes--never mind, Jo, don&apos;t look so
            overcome. A better time is coming. Anyway, they&apos;ll get used to it. It is only a
            question of time when my pretty feet won&apos;t have even a bowing acquaintance with
            a calf and will be too calloused <pb n="218" id="VAA3895-216"/>even for reminiscence.
            This is a world of adaptability, you know,&quot; he went on, with his old, whimsical
            smile. &quot;You are a good boy, Louis. Thank you. Gee! That feels good! Drink it
            in, poor feet, for you have to go again to-morrow. Fire ahead, Jo. So the old place is
            to be sold again. I thought Uncle Geoffrey would have to do that sooner or later. I
            would not go back, though, for all the world, would you, Jo? This is a right glorious
            country and we are here to stay. Heigho, but I am tired!&quot;</p>
          <p>He clasped his hands behind his head as he had done that night when he found Onjijitka
            sitting late with Josephine. There was a sudden, sharp report, a piercing scream,
            darkness, and the slim, tired body of John Calhoun Carroll, late a gentleman of
            Carolina, sank softly to the floor, while without many stars began to twinkle in the
            darkening sky, and drearily across the quiet country came the yelping of the
            coyotes.</p>
          <p>&quot;Josephine! I am shot!&quot;</p>
          <p>It was the boy who spoke, a great horror in his breaking voice.</p>
          <p>&quot;Where, dear? Do not be afraid,&quot; called Josephine, soothingly, as she
            groped her way around the table and took the rigid little figure <pb n="219"
              id="VAA3895-217"/>in her arms. &quot;Where, dearie, where are you
            hurt?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know, Josephine,&quot; sobbed the boy, clinging to her
            in a passion of uncontrollable terror. &quot;It came through the
            window.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;But when you screamed, where did it hurt you? Jack, why do you not come? Our
            boy has been shot. Oh, Louis, you must tell me where you are hurt. I cannot find a
            match. Jack! Jack!&quot;</p>
          <p>No answer broke the hush that followed this passionate appeal.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, dear boy,&quot; said Josephine, then, in a sweet, strained voice,
            &quot;you are not hurt at all. It is Jack. Do not sob so. I tell you it is Jack. Do
            you not see? Jack does not move. He is there by the door. I must shut that door or they
            will shoot him again.&quot; She rose to her feet unsteadily, supporting herself with
            her hand on the table. &quot;Come, Louis, we must shut the door.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;It came through the window, Josephine,&quot; repeated the boy.</p>
          <p>&quot;But I must shut the door,&quot; persisted Josephine.</p>
          <p>Very quietly she slipped forward, very quietly <pb n="220" id="VAA3895-218"/>put her
            arms around the shoulders of the boyish figure lying there so still, and gently lifted
            it wholly within, so that the bare white feet of him who had gone no longer rested upon
            the cold, hard stone of the doorway--those bare, white feet that never again would
            follow the unaccustomed harrow, or be bruised by the harsh leather of plough shoes. It
            is a glorious country, poor Jack, but the price of it was many a fair young life like
            yours and many a heart-ache like Josephine&apos;s. When Josephine had closed the
            door softly, she crept back to the boy.</p>
          <p>&quot;Get your rifle,&quot; she whispered. &quot;He is down at the
            woodpile--I saw him--and I know him--he will kill you, too, and me, Louis, if we do not
            kill him first. Quick!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Is Jack--&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes, dear, Jack is dead,&quot; she said, in a strange, quiet voice.
            &quot;Get your gun so that we may kill that man out there, and then go for
            help.&quot;</p>
          <p>Help! It was the slogan that sounded the rally to Tom Burrington&apos;s brother. It
            was then that his sturdy little soul, so peculiarly akin to that of the elder brother,
            leaped from the shackles of its own fear and never again, throughout all <pb n="221"
              id="VAA3895-219"/>the long watches of that night of terror, did he fail this girl whom
            Tom loved.</p>
          <p>&quot;Let me shoot, Josephine,&quot; he said, biting his lips desperately in
            his effort to keep them steady. &quot;You don&apos;t know how, and besides
            it&apos;s a man&apos;s work. No, Josephine, we must n&apos;t have a light.
            They saw too plainly before. They shot through the window, you know.&quot;</p>
          <p>But Josephine took the rifle from the small hands that would have clung to it, saying
            simply:</p>
          <p>&quot;I must do it. Jack would if he could--but he cannot--so I must. I promised
            Tom to take care of you.&quot;</p>
          <p>She crept again to the door, opened it slightly, turned the unaccustomed weapon toward
            the dark blur of the woodpile, and fired. The gun dropped from her nerveless hands to
            the floor.</p>
          <p>&quot;He was n&apos;t there, Louis,&quot; she said, pitifully. &quot;He
            is hiding somewhere. We shall have to stay until he goes away.&quot;</p>
          <p>She felt for a match, found one at last and lighted the lamp, which smoked
            distressingly, with its chimney scattered in fragments over the table and floor. The
            quick-witted boy hastily drew the blinds close and then Josephine, sitting upon the
            floor, took upon her lap the head of the <pb n="222" id="VAA3895-220"/>boy that was
            dead. In the half light, his face was serene and it seemed as if he smiled. It was a
            brave soul that had said he was here to stay, and now--he was already gone. But he had
            left in his stead the grace of a smile, half humorous, wholly accepting, of one who,
            however unexpectedly, had met and known and rebelled not weakly against the master of
            all the world--death. But if death be the master of all the world, why, then, as
            Josephine gazed on the still face in that solemn hour, that haunting air of mysterious
            triumph around the boyish mouth? Was it that, beyond the world, death had met its
            master?</p>
          <p>Josephine had no will to do aught but look upon that face as the time dragged heavily
            away. There was nothing else in all the world but Jack, and now that he was gone, what
            did anything matter? Only she was very glad that she had worn gloves in the garden that
            morning because now her hands were soft to touch the smooth white forehead--very white
            at the edge of the thick brown hair, but shading into tan above the closed eyes. Rosebud
            was coming to-morrow for a visit and she wondered idly what the Indian girl would say
            when she came to the ranch of the <pb n="223" id="VAA3895-221"/>Broken Key and knocked,
            and there would be no one to say, &quot;Come in.&quot; For of course she,
            Josephine, would be killed before morning. If not, Jack would come back for her. He
            would never leave his little sister alone--never. She could trust Jack. Would Onji, as
            Jack loved to call her, open the door and enter unbidden? Yes, for the key was broken
            and any one could come in who wanted to. There would be no one to keep any one out
            anyway--to-morrow. Poor little Rosebud! It would be very lonely for her in the time to
            come. There would be nowhere for her to go, any more, to have change from the slothful
            life in the home of Two Hawks. She would go back to the Dakotahs and never try to be
            white any more. But why not? It was such a lonesome world without one&apos;s own
            people. She, Josephine, could not bear it alone, so she was going back to her own--Jack
            was coming for her pretty soon now--so why should not poor, lonely, passionate,
            striving, slighted Rosebud go back and stay with her own? Two Hawks was a very good man,
            and nothing matters in all the world but one&apos;s own. Everything else is
            emptiness. One finds that out when one comes to die. But Rosebud would be very lonely
              <pb n="224" id="VAA3895-222"/>for a while. Generous-hearted Jack had been good to her,
            and she had tried to be, too. Would she cry? No, that was not her nature. She would just
            steal away again softly and go to the Seven-up, maybe, and then Tom would come and he
            was so big and strong that he would just pick them both up and lay them on the bed and
            then he would wonder where Louis was--why, where was Louis?</p>
          <p>And then it was as if Josephine&apos;s heart really broke, for she knew that she
            could not stay there any longer with the dear body of Jack; that she must no longer sit
            there and wait for Jack to come back. She knew that she must arise and go to the little
            boy who was so bravely quiet, but over whose sensitive young face hung the gray shadow
            of an awful horror. She laid the dear head upon the floor and stood up, pressing her
            hands just once against her eyes, where hot tears had sprung because the floor was so
            hard. Then she asked, steadily:</p>
          <p>&quot;Is he gone, Louis?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know, Josephine. I have not heard anything,&quot; he
            answered, his heart leaping at the sound of a human voice again.</p>
          <p>&quot;One of us will have to go and one of us will <pb n="225" id="VAA3895-223"
            />have to stay,&quot; said Josephine, in even, constrained tones. &quot;Which
            would you rather do, go or stay?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care, Josephine, honest. Which would you rather
            do?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I do not know what to do. I cannot leave you and I cannot send you.&quot;
            Her voice died away drearily.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am not afraid of Jack,&quot; fabricated the boy, &quot;and I am not
            afraid to go, either. Maybe the man is gone.&quot;</p>
          <p>Josephine shook her head.</p>
          <p>&quot;No, dear,&quot; she said, resolutely, though often the sweet voice broke,
            &quot;we&apos;ll both go. Jack is dead. They can do nothing more to him. I
            promised to take care of you, so we&apos;ll go together, you and I.&quot;</p>
          <p>With something to do, a sad courage and strength had come back to her. She did not look
            again at the quiet form, but hurriedly blew out the smoking light, took firm hold of
            Louis&apos; rifle, and held out her hand to the boy.</p>
          <p>&quot;We must climb out of the bedroom window,&quot; she said.</p>
          <p>&quot;But he shot through there,&quot; remonstrated the boy, who was never to
            forget the awfulness of <pb n="226" id="VAA3895-224"/>that shot through the window when
            the bullet had whistled past him so close that he thought it had found him.</p>
          <p>&quot;I know, but I saw the man afterwards down by the woodpile, so we cannot go by
            the door,&quot; decided Josephine. &quot;Come into the bedroom. We will get out
            at that window.&quot;</p>
          <p>Noiselessly, they crept to the bedroom window, raised it softly, and peered out. It was
            very dark--so dark that Josephine caught her breath with the thought of daring it. The
            air was still, warm, oppressive, and hard to breathe. A storm was coming. They heard the
            mutter of distant thunder following a bright flash of lightning that showed huge masses
            of black and angry clouds drifting rapidly up from the west, and that left the hovering,
            waiting gloom the murkier and the more insistent because of the brief illumination. The
            storm would break soon. They must hasten. A new thought came to Josephine. She groped
            her way to the rude closet, felt resolutely among Jack&apos;s belongings until she
            found coat and trousers, and then she quickly changed her own clothes for those that had
            been Jack&apos;s.</p>
          <p>&quot;We can run better,&quot; she whispered, &quot;and my skirt will not
            always be catching on something, <pb n="227" id="VAA3895-225"/>and maybe they will be
            afraid of me because they will think that I am a man.&quot;</p>
          <p>She pushed the boy gently aside.</p>
          <p>&quot;I must go first, chum,&quot; she said.</p>
          <p>Ah, God! What was that? Was it the guarded snap of a trigger struck into place for
            deadly readiness? And had the faint rustling of the grass that preceded it been caused
            by the stealthy haste of a man to be on time? There was no wind to disturb the grass. Or
            was it the first sigh of the storm? She climbed frantically back into the room, shot
            wildly two or three times out of the window, and then, panting with terror, leaned
            against the wall.</p>
          <p>&quot;We shall have to stay all night,&quot; she said, chokingly. &quot;He
            is out there. He won&apos;t let us get away. We must keep shooting, Louis, all the
            time. We must never stop. We must let him know that we are not utterly helpless and at
            his mercy. Have you lots of cartridges? We must not waste them. We must put some aside
            for--an emergency.&quot;</p>
          <p>They did keep shooting all the night long, just to let some one out there in the dark
            and the storm know that they were not utterly helpless and at his mercy--they, a
            stricken girl and a little child, <pb n="228" id="VAA3895-226"/>to whom the wild,
            electrical storm with its beating rain and the roar and crash of its thunder came like
            heavy cannonading from an answering enemy. They shot through the doorway, through the
            shattered west window, through the bedroom window, and then through the doorway again,
            and so the weary round--twice and thrice and countless times, till the first creeping
            gray of the early dawn outlined the hill summits and the tops of the taller trees on the
            island while the valleys and the lower thickets remained yet a menacing, haunted blur of
            black. Then hand in hand they watched at the window. The storm had been brief, though
            furious, and had long since died away. When the near thickets began faintly but surely
            to show form and substance and the light of the eastern hills took on rose tints,
            Josephine led the boy to the inner room and made him lie down to rest for an hour, and
            soon, spent with fear and fatigue, he slept. But Josephine did not sleep, and when it
            was entirely light and there was no one to be seen in all the lonely land, she awakened
            the boy. The window stood wide open.</p>
          <p>&quot;It is better--slip through this way and run, dear boy, run. You must not be
            afraid. No one <pb n="229" id="VAA3895-227"/>will dare hurt you, Tom
            Burrington&apos;s brother. It is day, too. Do you hear me? You are not to be afraid.
            Now go, dear.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Poor Josephine,&quot; said Louis, slipping his arms around her neck for a
            quick embrace. &quot;How white you are and how tired! I will run all the way, so it
            won&apos;t be long. Are you sure that you are not afraid? Had n&apos;t I better
            stay?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes, Louis, I am afraid,&quot; said Josephine, with a smile, the
            exceeding pathos of which the boy never forgot, &quot;but I am more afraid to go and
            leave you--and we cannot go together now--it is too late. You must not be seen with poor
            Josephine Carroll any more, for she is Jack&apos;s sister, you know. So please
            hurry, won&apos;t you, chum?&quot;</p>
          <p>Closing the window after the boy as he slipped away into the chill of the early
            morning, Josephine crept back to watch by Jack alone.</p>

        <div2 type="chapter">
          <head>CHAPTER XIV</head>
          <head>THE NEXT MORNING</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">J</hi>OSEPHINE was tired. A deadly weariness held the muscles of her arms
            and shoulders in a thraldom the chains of which the sight of the murderer himself
            peering in at the fatal west window could not have broken. Those firm-fleshed young arms
            had done well when the need of them had been insistent; when all night long, death had
            sat brooding over the little isolated house in the valley. But with the cool first light
            of the June morning came a relaxation of the tense muscles and a strange apathy of the
            brain which engendered a woful loss of nerve force. The time passed unaccounted for;
            time during which Josephine, sitting on the floor, stared dumbly into space; time during
            which she could not have lifted a hand in self-defence though the summons had left her
            no alternative but instant death, and though Louis&apos; rifle lay close to her
            feet; time during which the sun swung higher and higher up into the deep blue of the
            Dakota sky, and the mournful low of the milch <pb n="231" id="VAA3895-229"/>cows,
            calling Jack, beat distressfully upon her ears although she heard it not for what it
            meant.</p>
          <p>Finally she arose, mechanically changed her clothes, and resumed her position upon the
            floor. She was sitting thus when Tom came. She heard nothing of the hoof beats on the
            sod, nothing of the clamor of that wild ride nor the heavy breathing of the hard-ridden
            horse dragged to a stand-still, without the hint of a slowing-down, so that when the
            door was thrown open, she shuddered softly, bewilderedly, with an unreasoning dread of
            supernatural visitation.</p>
          <p>&quot;Josephine!&quot;</p>
          <p>Louis had told him. He knew that he should find Jack lying there dead and that
            Josephine would be sitting hopelessly and drearily close by. The sadness of that which
            he saw now with his actual eyes, he had seen with his inner vision all the way while he
            rode like the wind, triple-guised, a saint of relief, a devil of vengeance, justice
            incarnate. He had just entered the living room for the early breakfast which prevailed
            at the Seven-up in the summer-time, when the child, utterly exhausted, white with
            fatigue, tear-streaked and travel-stained, stumbled into the room from the front
            entrance. The unspeakable relief which <pb n="232" id="VAA3895-230"/>the sight of the
            broad-shouldered, flannel-shirted, keen-eyed, self-confident man who was his big brother
            brought to the sorely tried boy, was too much for his self-control and he began to sob
            abandonedly, standing by the door and making no effort to come further within. Tom
            understood then and yet he stayed a moment to listen to the boy&apos;s broken story,
            and stayed yet a moment longer to put the child in his mother&apos;s arms, and then,
            nothing short of Omnipotence could have stayed him longer. Yet all he could say was,
            &quot;Josephine!&quot; He repeated it helplessly,
            &quot;Josephine!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I am glad it is you,&quot; said Josephine, in a quiet little voice.
            &quot;I did not hear you coming. Did Louis tell you?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes, he told me,&quot; said Tom, huskily. He strode forward, seized the
            cold hands in his warm clasp and lifted her strongly to her feet.</p>
          <p>&quot;Come, Josephine,&quot; he said, almost roughly. &quot;You must not
            sit there any longer. There is too much to do. Have you had any breakfast?&quot;</p>
          <p>She shook her head drearily while the first tears that had come to her eyes since she
            laid Jack&apos;s head on the hard floor stood there now because she could not
            understand this terrible new <pb n="233" id="VAA3895-231"/>sternness of Tom&apos;s.
            What had she done that he should speak to her thus? She began to sob childishly. She had
            thought that when Tom came much of her trouble would be over because he was so big and
            capable--he would help her to bear it--and instead, he was scolding her--and why? Was it
            because of Louis?</p>
          <p>&quot;I did n&apos;t know what else to do,&quot; she pleaded.</p>
          <p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; asked Tom, sharply.</p>
          <p>&quot;About Louis, you know. I promised you that no harm should come to him and I
            did try to make my words come true. But I could not leave him, could I? I thought that
            it would be so terrible for a little child to stay here all alone with--with--And I
            could not go with him because they would have killed him, too, if he had been seen with
            Jack&apos;s sister. So I let him go alone. I am sorry. I did not mean to do
            wrong.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Josephine, if you do not keep still, you will kill me,&quot; said Tom,
            brokenly. &quot;I thank my God that you were not alone. I shall be a better man
            always for this, that He did not let you be altogether alone--even if there was no one
            to help you but a little child. My girl, what made you think of such a monstrous
            thing?&quot;</p>
          <pb n="234" id="VAA3895-232"/>
          <p>&quot;You were so cross,&quot; she said, despondently.</p>
          <p>The man gripped himself hard. She seemed so utterly helpless standing there by the
            unresponsive body of the one man in all the world who had authority over her, so young
            and fair and sweet, and yet because of her great sorrow, so far removed from his
            lover&apos;s touch, that he must crucify the imperious demands of his whole being to
            crush her in his arms and comfort her there. Had he been harsh with her? If he had, it
            was because of the fierce longing that was in him, that was so hard to control.</p>
          <p>&quot;I did not mean to be,&quot; he said, gently.</p>
          <p>&quot;I know it,&quot; she said, smiling sadly. She was stronger now and knew
            that while it was good to have him there and that he would know how to do the things
            that had to be done, yet her trouble she must bear alone--forever. She knew now that
            there was no other way. &quot;I am very tired and I did not understand just for a
            minute. Forgive me. What shall I do now?&quot;</p>
          <p>As her hint of a cry for help had been the younger brother&apos;s call to rally
            last night, so Josephine&apos;s complete dependence upon him made Tom his own man
            again now. Quietly but purposefully he went about the duty that lay before <pb n="235"
              id="VAA3895-233"/>him. Stepping into the next room, he robbed the scarcely disturbed
            bed of its upper covering and returning, spread it reverently over the body of his
            friend. Then searching for and quickly finding a big tin cup, he left the house, to
            return shortly with the cup brimming with fresh milk which he commanded her to drink.
            She obeyed, too weary to resist his dominant will.</p>
          <p>&quot;Now, Josephine,&quot; he said, earnestly, &quot;I shall have to leave
            you for a little while. Do not worry. I shall come back just as soon as I can. It will
            not take me long. Do not leave the house. You will remember that, won&apos;t you? Do
            not be afraid that anything will happen to me. I will be back in ten minutes. Do you
            understand?&quot;</p>
          <p>Yes, she understood. There was no fear but that she understood, poor Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;Must you go? Is there no other way? Must I be left alone again?&quot;</p>
          <p>He put his arm for one moment around the slight, drooping shoulders while she read the
            hard, inevitable truth in his pitying eyes, and then hastily left the house.</p>
          <p>He crossed the bed of the slough dry-shod, though with some difficulty, as the river
            was rapidly rising, and went directly to Frank LaDue&apos;s <pb n="236"
              id="VAA3895-234"/>cabin on the island. There was no one there. At least no one
            responded to his peremptory summons. He had not thought to find any one at home and yet
            he kept one hand very near to his pistol belt while he unceremoniously thrust open the
            door and entered unbidden. Convinced that the house was deserted, he was on the point of
            leaving when something over by the bed attracted his attention. He stared meditatively
            at a pair of rough, half-worn shoes, the plough and harrow kind, not the dapper riding
            boots of the cowboy, and they were caked with yellow mud not yet altogether dry. They
            interested him, these shoes, and yet he must not waste time upon them. He proceeded
            quickly to the stable and corral. There was no one there. He glanced at the sun. It was
            high time that the proper authorities be called into action and assistance rendered to
            Josephine. He longed greatly to pursue his investigations relentlessly to the inexorable
            end, when he should stand face to face with Jack&apos;s murderer. But there was
            Josephine. Too much time had been frittered away already. If only he had waited at the
            Seven-up long enough for his mother to accompany him! He gazed longingly into the depths
            of the forest to the <pb n="237" id="VAA3895-235"/>north. How close together grew the
            trees and how massive the trunks of many! He knew that most of the cowboys around
            cherished the belief that the unbranded calves from the Indian herds were systematically
            driven from the Reservation into the seclusion of this heavy timber here to remain until
            such time as the lord of the domain deemed it wise to remove them to the open. Surely
            the belief was a well-grounded one. It would give him a lively satisfaction to penetrate
            that leafy labyrinth, if only there were not such crying need of him elsewhere. But,
            after all, it would be foolhardy to attempt to run down a man--or men--in that unknown
            wilderness where a clever fugitive, forewarned, might elude one enemy for days at a time
            and all the while be silently laughing behind some gigantic cottonwood where, if the
            mood struck him, he could end his pursuer&apos;s days of searching by the simple jar
            of a little steel hammer. And then what would become of Josephine? He turned away
            resolutely and would not heed the bright-eyed, saucy squirrels that seemed, cunningly,
            to try to lure him farther and farther within the dim forest. He retraced his steps and
            reëntered the house.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am going to town now, Josephine,&quot; he said, <pb n="238"
              id="VAA3895-236"/>gravely. &quot;I shall not be gone long. You must not be afraid.
            There is no one anywhere around the premises--neither here nor on the island. I could
            not go and leave you alone until I had satisfied myself thoroughly that there was no
            one. I--hate to leave you, but as you say, there is no other way. Why, Josephine, you
            look different. Have you dressed again?&quot; he asked, doubtfully.</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;for I have found another way. I must go
            and you must stay.&quot;</p>
          <p>True. She had taken advantage of Tom&apos;s absence to change her pretty gingham
            house gown for her riding habit. She was dressed for out-of-doors even to her
            gauntletted riding gloves. She was very pale, her lips were pressed tightly together,
            and her dark eyes were haunted with shadows that were destined to come and go as long as
            life lasted; otherwise, she seemed perfectly composed and self-reliant.</p>
          <p>He did not acquiesce readily. In truth, he disputed her intention vehemently, but,
            &quot;Mr. Burrington,&quot; she asked, unexpectedly, &quot;do you believe
            that they are satisfied with Jack&apos;s death alone?&quot;</p>
          <p>He was taken completely by surprise and utterly confounded for the moment. He
            hesitated <pb n="239" id="VAA3895-237"/>in troubled doubt. Was it possible that she,
            too, was connecting the gulch incident with last night? &quot;Tell me, Mr.
            Burrington,&quot; she insisted, her eyes beginning to shine with a feverish
            brilliance, &quot;am I exempt, or is it annihilation? Tell me, for I must
            know.&quot;</p>
          <p>He bowed his head for a moment while his struggle lasted. It was very bitter for a man
            of Burrington&apos;s make to let a girl ride away into action that at best was
            fraught with peril while he remained with folded hands behind. But anything was better
            than to leave her here alone where so many things might happen. Was it not true that
            Josephine, too, was proscribed? It would be criminal inefficiency to refuse to take into
            consideration the man&apos;s probable return to complete his work. The thought was
            unbearable. Josephine would be far, far safer in the wide outdoors with a fast horse and
            a good rifle.</p>
          <p>&quot;I do not know,&quot; she said, steadily. &quot;It has come to me just
            now that I have sometimes thought you knew something that you would not tell us. Who
            knows? Maybe, if you had--&quot; she hesitated, trembling violently. &quot;But
            however that may be, I must go now.&quot; She stepped to the door and opened it.</p>
          <pb n="240" id="VAA3895-238"/>
          <p>Tom turned his haggard face away for a moment and gazed silently out of the window.
            There was a terrible pain in his heart that spread to his eyes and burned them and
            struggled doggedly for the mastery of his self-control.</p>
          <p>&quot;You are right,&quot; he said at last, quietly. &quot;It is better for
            you to go. But I shall go with you.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;And leave--him--alone?&quot; she asked, with a touch of scorn.</p>
          <p>&quot;Then you must go alone,&quot; he said, with an effort. &quot;Come, we
            have lost too much time already.&quot;</p>
          <p>His horse stood patiently at the door, the bridle rein trailing to the ground. Quickly,
            resourcefully, he shortened the stirrups. &quot;You will ride my horse,&quot; he
            said, with cold authority. &quot;He is all ready and besides he is the
            longest-winded and fastest horse on the range.&quot; He slipped his arm through the
            bridle rein and started for the river, Josephine following blindly. Arrived at the boat
            landing, they found the ferry gone; but the light skiff was there tugging away
            unweariedly at its safe moorings, rebelliously desirous of floating away with the swift
            current.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, he will just have to swim,&quot; said Tom, tersely.</p>
          <pb n="241" id="VAA3895-239"/>
          <p>Holding the boat steady with one hand, he held out the other to Josephine. After a
            momentary hesitation, she gave him her hand and stepped into the boat.</p>
          <p>&quot;You will have to sit in the stern and lead the horse,&quot; said Tom.
            &quot;I am sorry to make you do this, but he might not follow docilely, at least
            until we strike the middle of the river.&quot; He handed the reins to Josephine,
            sprang into the boat, seized the oars and pushed off.</p>
          <p>On the far shore, gravely kind despite his heartache, he lifted her into the saddle and
            fitted his own rifle across the saddle horn.</p>
          <p>&quot;Do not spare the horse,&quot; he said. &quot;Only be careful not to
            cripple him before you reach the uplands. Give him his head and he will not fail you.
            Good-bye, Josephine.&quot;</p>
          <p>Tom Burrington watched the blue-clad figure until it disappeared up the Gap; then he
            returned to the straining boat and rowed back across the yellow river to take his turn
            at watching alone.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XV</head>
          <head>THE LONG CHASE</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">O</hi>NCE safely upon the plateau surrounded only by unobstructed
            distances and the soft, rare, sun-shot atmosphere that touched her like a benediction
            after her long night of murk and horror, Josephine&apos;s fear fell away from her.
            She rode rapidly but not constrainedly. Jack would be well cared for now and she was so
            tired. There was all the time in the world and a long life to live alone. She must never
            hurry what she had to do any more because, when the things were all done, what would she
            do then? There was so much time that had to be lived through. She was stronger than she
            had been last night and knew that it was only a delirious though pleasing phantasy of a
            bewildered brain that had deceived her into the belief that Jack would come back to her.
            She knew to-day that she would have to live her life--without Jack. It would be a very
            long life, too, because she was so young and very strong. She could not remember having
            ever been really ill since the old days of the measles and the <pb n="243"
              id="VAA3895-241"/>whooping cough. She was not the kind who might pine away and die of
            heart-break. She should just have to live it out--alone--there was no help for her--the
            last of her race--just a lonely girl with nowhere to go. After a while, a long, dreary,
            barren while, she would be a white-haired, sad-eyed old woman--still with nowhere to go.
            She did not see how she could bear it--but she should just have to--there was no other
            way.</p>
          <p>And then for some vague, indefinable reason, she turned her head and glanced back over
            the road she had just come. It stretched behind her straight and level and
            rain-freshened, but she was no longer alone upon it. What was there so hauntingly
            familiar in the pose of the man riding so rapidly her way? She hesitated for a moment,
            gazing earnestly backward. His horse seemed to be clearing the ground in great leaps.
            Suddenly the truth came to her in a sickening sense of comprehension. He was the man
            with the baby blue eyes whom she had recognized last night lurking around the wood yard
            of the Broken Key--and he had dared to give chase after her on the high road. Ah, God!
            Would this terrible nightmare never end? She pressed her pale lips close to- <pb n="244"
              id="VAA3895-242"/>gether, leaned low in the saddle, and gave the horse his head with a
            whispered word in his ear as she had been wont to speak to Long Chase. Long Chase! What
            was it that Jack had said once about the &quot;long chase&quot;? She shuddered
            because it had come and she had not her own. Was it an evil omen that, when the time was
            come, Long Chase should be peacefully grazing many miles away?</p>
          <p>Yet it was a good horse she rode and he ran with head low and with long, loping strides
            that measured off the land in regular and telling distances; but the speed of her horse
            was to be of no advantage. She heard the report of a rifle and the whistle of a bullet
            as it passed in close proximity to her. She had lingered too long pondering the long,
            dreary years that stretched out before her into such an infinity of unendingness, and
            now her life was to be cut off short as Jack&apos;s had been, without time for
            reconstructing her outlook, without choice or appeal. Moreover, she was to be shot down
            in malicious, unreasoning play. Jack was a man and as such had been big game worthy the
            unremitting zeal and changeless purpose of the huntsman; but just because she was a
            no-account, friendless girl, troublesome <pb n="245" id="VAA3895-243"/>only by reason of
            her relationship to Jack, she was to be shot down in the ruthless, inconsequential way
            of the sportsman, who, after having successfully stalked his big game, picks off a
            gopher or a blue bird or a harmless owl, for no reason at all except an overflow of
            exuberant and wanton spirits. Was there any other reason why any one should desire to
            kill her? Well, and why not? The years were long--Jack was dead. Half-unconsciously, she
            drew rein. Let the end come now. It was far, far better so. She and Jack could go
            together, after all. Nothing else was worth while, so of what use this blind struggle
            for mere life--life that would be too hard to live even if she won it? Death by the
            bullet was easy--that is--it would be only a second or two and Jack had borne it. She
            could bear it, too. Why should she, a girl, presume to be the last of a race noted
            through generations for its gallant men? She heard another shot and the whir of another
            bullet.</p>
          <p>Suddenly the blood rushed to her colorless face, the insane stare of the brown eyes
            into the unrevealed mysteries of another world gave way to a warm human look of firm
            resolve, and once again Tom&apos;s horse bounded over the road making the <pb
              n="246" id="VAA3895-244"/>best run of his life and with an evil light in his eye for
            the presumptuous cayuse who had dared to gain so many leagues during the temporary
            aberration of mind of his strange rider whose slightest behest he instinctively obeyed,
            however unwillingly. Perhaps there was something in the pressure of the knees and in the
            feel of the bit that told him he must--that though his burden was light it was
            masterful.</p>
          <p>Ay! Jack was dead; but the slayer of him was not and while he lived, Josephine would
            live, too. The reaction had come. There would be time enough and to spare for her to try
            to find a way to live the long years when Jack&apos;s murderer had been made to
            drink to the bitter dregs the cup which was &quot;An eye for an eye and a tooth for
            a tooth.&quot;</p>
          <p>She had accomplished about twelve miles of her journey when she turned to find herself
            pursued. Soon the road swerved sharply around a grove of trees planted years ago by a
            man who had dreamed dreams but who had not had the courage of them and had retraced his
            way to the nearer but more limited opportunities of an older civilization. The place was
            now deserted save for birds and wild prairie creatures. On the far <pb n="247"
              id="VAA3895-245"/>side, Josephine dismounted, led the horse well within the shelter of
            the trees and tied him securely. She should have need of him--afterwards, and so there
            must be no possibility of the animal&apos;s abandoning her in a sudden fright. She
            was quite calm and made her plans collectedly, taking up her own station behind a huge
            straight-trunked cottonwood and waiting. She realized fully that her position would not
            be tenable long should she fail in her purpose. There were no more turns on the road to
            Velpen. He could see that she was not on it. It was sweet and quiet and cool here under
            the trees after the rain; and there was a home-like, woodsy smell, faint but true,
            because of the dampened foliage that had lain there many years. If he would only just
            pass on and leave her unmolested! Presently then, she would slip out and continue her
            journey to town and let him whose right it was, and whose duty, do for the murderer what
            there was to be done. But in her heart she knew that he would not pass on. The iron-shod
            feet were coming very near now. Just a moment and they would round the point. But how
            long that moment was! Long since it seemed to her that it must have passed and still <pb
              n="248" id="VAA3895-246"/>she heard and could not see. How regular and rhythmical the
            hoof-beats were, pounding along on the hardened earth whose surface only had been thinly
            affected by last night&apos;s storm. She put her free hand to her throat. She had an
            almost uncontrollable inclination to scream aloud in hysteria. Why did he not come? She
            wondered irrelevantly if her pretty hair would be found to be gray-streaked when this
            was all over. He came at last, his horse lathered with the heat of the chase. The man
            with the baby blue eyes evidently had not thought of let or hindrance, for he swung
            around the angle without diminution of speed. There was even something of triumph in the
            sweep of his unguarded curve toward the new prospective, as if insolently assured that
            now the end was very near. He glanced down the road and made a movement as though to
            stop his horse. It was at that moment Josephine shot. Not in vain had been
            Louis&apos; painstaking effort to teach his friend of his own newly acquired and
            proudly shared knowledge of firearms only the day before; for the man lurched forward in
            his saddle and fell prone to the ground.</p>
          <p>For a moment the world turned dark to Josephine and she leaned heavily against the tree
            for <pb n="249" id="VAA3895-247"/>support. She had killed the slayer of her brother!
            Would the nightmare never end? But she could not leave him out there in the road alone
            for the pitiless sun to beat upon and the rollicking prairie wind to sport with. Now
            that he was dead, a strange pity for him surged up in her woman&apos;s heart. The
            horse was standing perfectly still where he had so abruptly halted when his rider had
            fallen at his feet. Tremblingly, Josephine approached. He seemed very young lying so
            helplessly there, his eyes closed and one arm thrown out between the horse&apos;s
            feet where a step would have trampled it into the earth. Stooping, she gathered the big,
            inert shoulders within her arms, overcoming by a tremendous effort of will the sudden
            violent repugnance that laid hold of her when she remembered for whom she had so short a
            time before performed a like service. She laid him down in the shade of the cottonwood
            whose leaves were quivering and rustling one against another with a lonesome sound, and
            then with a little sob of relief she turned to her horse. But she paused irresolute, her
            hand on the bridle rein, a new horror dawning upon her face. What was it, that faint,
            far-away sound, so distant when first it arrested her <pb n="250" id="VAA3895-248"
            />attention but growing more and more distinct--so rapid, so regular, so insistent? Was
            it the beat of other hoofs upon the sod? Was Frank LaDue coming to gloat over the
            culmination of his heinous plots? Or was it a dream sound, that running, pounding,
            louder-growing, heart-clutching clamor that would break and subside into vague echoes of
            unreality only when she might struggle free from the nightmare that had haunted her all
            night? She crept close to Tom&apos;s horse for companionship, and in numbed dread
            waited.</p>

            far better, humiliation in the sight of this arrogant rancher than repudiation--here--of
            that which was the highest and best thing she had ever known. She could never speak of
            it again afterward, never stoop to explain, this she knew, but here and now it was like
            cheating the dead--the beloved dead--to even act a lie; besides she was a woman of the
            Dakotahs and it was her right <pb n="252" id="VAA3895-250"/>to mourn aloud for the brave
            who had gone. So she threw back her head with a gesture of pride and looked at the
            intruder squarely while in her sombre black eyes glowed the mysteries of the most sacred
            thing of two races met in one.</p>
          <p>&quot;He was not like any man I ever knew before,&quot; she said.</p>
          <p>This was Onjijitka&apos;s lament for the dead. Thus began and ended her public
            mourning. She had held to her racial instinct to cry aloud her grief; she had not lied
            to the spirit that was gone. Never again did she break her sealed reticence and speak of
            that which was in the heart of her heart as she had spoken to Tom Burrington of the
            Seven-up by the side of the dead man. But henceforth she was always solitary, growing
            more silent and reserved as time went on, and liking much to slip away by herself
            somewhere on the wide prairie and listen all day long, perhaps, to the whispering grass
            and the singing wind, trying to attune her mortal ear to the secrets they were forever
            trying to tell.</p>
          <p>&quot;Who has done this thing, Rosebud?&quot; asked Tom, presently, when he had
            succeeded in swallowing the lump in his throat that had suddenly thrust itself there for
            Rosebud&apos;s sake.</p>
          <pb n="253" id="VAA3895-251"/>
          <p>&quot;Frank LaDue,&quot; she answered unhesitatingly.</p>
          <p>&quot;What makes you think so?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You think so, too, don&apos;t you?&quot; counter-questioned the
            girl.</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes, I am afraid that I do,&quot; said Tom, slowly. &quot;I
            know--what I know,&quot; said Rosebud, enigmatically. &quot;Where is
            Josephine?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;She has gone to town for help.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;And you let her go?&quot; accused Rosebud.</p>
          <p>&quot;I could not help it, Rosebud. She is safer in the open than here, and some
            one had to go.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I could have taken care of her,&quot; said she.</p>
          <p>&quot;But I did not know that you were coming. I should not have let her go had I
            known.&quot;</p>
          <p>Frowningly, Rosebud gazed out at the open door and it was as if she were listening to
            something afar off. Tom watched her silently and wondered about many things in that
            brief while, but about one thing most of all. Had Jack loved this lithe-limbed,
            beautiful maid of the Dakotahs? That was something he could never know.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am afraid for Josephine,&quot; said Rosebud, at last, turning to him
            and speaking thoughtfully. &quot;What if he should take after her? He hates
            Josephine. He calls her names--as he does me. The night he stole the cow, you know, he
              <pb n="254" id="VAA3895-252"/>called her names. I heard him. I am afraid for
            Josephine.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;There was no one at home on the island,&quot; said Tom, soberly.
            &quot;I ascertained that the first thing this morning.&quot;</p>
          <p>Rosebud shrugged her shoulders. &quot;Not at home, maybe, but not far away, I
            &apos;ll warrant you. Come, let us see if the boat is still there.&quot;</p>
          <p>They left the house together, carefully closing the door behind them, and hastened down
            to the shore. There was a light wind blowing. They could hear it in the treetops. The
            water lapping the bank and sucking away the sand made a gentle, dreamy sound suggestive
            of solitude and unread mysteries. There was no other sound to break the summer
            stillness. The two stared at one another blankly.</p>
          <p>&quot;It&apos;s gone, Rosebud,&quot; said Tom at last, mechanically,
            passing his hand over his forehead to brush away an imaginary something there. But the
            girl&apos;s eager eyes were already fixed upon the opposite hills which, seemingly
            destitute of life, lay in strange convolutions beneath the blazing sun, their
            gumbo-blackened outlines softened by the shimmering distance.</p>
          <pb n="255" id="VAA3895-253"/>
          <p>&quot;Look, Tom!&quot; she cried, suddenly, in quick and burning excitement.
            &quot;There--on the hill--no, beyond the Gap--the second rise!&quot;</p>
          <p>Plainly silhouetted against the blue and sunlit sky on the highest point on the other
            side, rode a man who had not been there a moment before and who must have just
            accomplished the tortuous climb to the level. In a moment, he had disappeared from view
            behind the rim, into the broad high plains beyond.</p>
          <p>&quot;He rides like Henry Hoffman,&quot; said Tom, in a dangerously calm voice.
            &quot;LaDue is a slop in the saddle.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;But Henry Hoffman works for LaDue,&quot; said Rosebud.</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes, Henry Hoffman works for LaDue,&quot; said Tom, slowly. &quot;We
            must find another boat,&quot; he added, decisively.</p>
          <p>He glanced keenly up and down the sandy, treacherous shore. The Indian girl had no need
            to deprecate his slow, methodical reasoning now. When action was the paramount
            consideration, his the initiative, hers to follow. He explained briefly during their
            short and unsatisfactory search for another boat what he intended to do. He would cross
            the river if he had to swim it, go <pb n="256" id="VAA3895-254"/>to Ole
            Johnson&apos;s place a quarter of a mile down the river, and borrow his fast horse.
            He was confident that thus equipped, even with the handicap of lost time, he could
            overtake any horse that LaDue owned, or any horse on the range for that matter, except
            the one Josephine was riding.</p>
          <p>Half-sunken in the fine, shifting, and watery sands and considerably below the usual
            boat landing, they came suddenly upon a clumsy skiff, an ancient derelict whose days of
            adequate service had long since gone by. Nevertheless, they quickly dragged it upon the
            shore, quickly turned it upon its side and emptied it of its contents, Rosebud obeying
            the man&apos;s behests with an unquestioning faith and comprehension that boded well
            for Josephine&apos;s rescue.</p>
          <p>&quot;It leaks like the devil,&quot; said Tom, &quot;but when it is full I
            &apos;ll abandon it.&quot;</p>
          <p>He kicked off his shoes as he spoke, in anticipation of the contemplated emergency.
            Fortunately a pair of oars thrown up on the bank and forgotten these many moons were
            found to be reasonably sound and Tom determined to trust himself and his mission without
            further delay to this precarious means of transportation.</p>
          <pb n="257" id="VAA3895-255"/>
          <p>&quot;I will go with you to bail for you,&quot; proffered Rosebud, bravely.</p>
          <p>&quot;No, Rosebud,&quot; said Tom, firmly. &quot;You are needed here. Have
            you thought of the possibility of--some one&apos;s returning and attempting to burn
            the house in order to hide all evidence of the crime? You know what to do if any one
            comes. Good-bye, girl.&quot;</p>
          <p>Rosebud did not linger to see how he fared. The man out there in the condemned boat had
            little need of the girl&apos;s emotional attendance upon this play of his, either
            for moral support or to feed his enthusiasm. This was not a spectacular play to be acted
            before the grandstand or a coterie of ardent admirers whose champion he was. It was the
            play of life and death. He had need of nothing in this world but his own indomitable
            spirit, his steady nerve, his incomparable strength and--the thought of Josephine. In
            the world beyond, perhaps, he had need of much, but that did not bother Tom, because if
            he had stopped to think about how great was his need of a power far superior to his own,
            his opportunity would have been lost. So he concentrated all his faculties upon his own
            capabilities, and the Indian girl knew that he would do well. But there <pb n="258"
              id="VAA3895-256"/>was one who needed her. She glanced once at the man making his slow,
            wearisome way across the river, her eagerness and animation gradually giving place to a
            strange immobility of expression, then turned, and, abandoning the heavy sand of the
            wagon road for the greater solitude and aloofness of an untried way through the timber,
            silently and swiftly made her way back to the Broken Key.</p>
          <p>The terrible push of the current gave Tom little time to bail the rapidly filling boat.
            The water did not seep its way through infinitesimal crevices but literally poured in
            through the gaping cracks of the water-soaked and water-warped flat bottom, with a
            gurgle and a chuckle that seemed to gloat, tantalizingly, in anticipation of the
            inevitable result of this hard-fought struggle for supremacy. When he desisted for a
            moment in his effort to cut the channel as nearly as possible at right angles, he was
            carried swiftly down the river so that he lost any advantage that accrued temporarily
            from the lightened boat, as it soon filled again, and the little headway he had gained
            was more than balanced by the loss of his ability now to make an advantageous landing at
            the Gap. Meanwhile, up there beyond those <pb n="259" id="VAA3895-257"/>frowning and
            precipitous cliffs, an unprotected girl was riding furiously for her life, maybe, while
            a fiend rode in relentless pursuit. The water played treacherously around his bare feet,
            plashing back and forth with a gathering momentum, swayed by the impetus of the powerful
            and determined strokes of the oars wielded undauntedly against heavy odds. Now the water
            covered his ankles. His exertion was gigantic. He had no more strength in reserve. He
            was using it all--to the very dregs. Perspiration came out in big beads on his forehead
            and trickled down his set face. The handkerchief around his throat became damp and
            steamy and choking, but he could not spare a hand to remove it. Sunlight scintillated on
            the dancing ripples and his eyes ached with the glare of it until the green of the
            receding shore was lost to him in a blur of shimmering white.</p>
          <p>He was half way across when the hungry, ingulfing waters flowed over the sides of the
            boat and met, with the exultant kiss of the conquering, the inner waters which, like
            some warriors of Greece seons ago, who, having gained a surreptitious entrance into the
            city of their wrath, treacherously it may be, but with the fortunes of <pb n="260"
              id="VAA3895-258"/>war, opened its gates to the conquering horde, had made this
            victorious meeting possible. Tom was prepared for the triumphant embrace. He rolled
            easily into the water, away from the suction of the sinking boat, and rested for the
            fraction of a minute upon his back before striking out for the still distant shore.</p>
          <p>The odds were tremendous but he overcame them all, and accomplished his stint to the
            quieter waters that crowded against the steep, slaty cliffs, and breathed freely once
            more. Here a new difficulty presented itself and one that threatened grave results. The
            annual June rise had begun and the river was rolling high between its banks, so that
            only where the deeper ravines drew to the river was a landing practicable or even
            possible. He had drifted so far with the current that he had long ago passed the deep
            gap in the hills that gave access for crossing to the island and to the Broken Key
            ranch, and now a perpendicular wall of solid chalk rock reared itself upward, appalling
            in its significance. The wash of other rises had worn the rock almost to the smoothness
            of glass, so that there was nothing a man might grasp to stay his deadly progress down
            the river. Had he passed Ole Johnson&apos;s <pb n="261" id="VAA3895-259"/>cattle
            trail to the water course? If he had, poor Josephine! He was very strong to endure. He
            might manage to keep the greedy water out of his lungs by kindly luck and by just
            drifting until this hideous nightmare of an unbroken cliff gave way to the open country,
            but it would be too late for Josephine, far too late, poor Josephine! The thought made
            him frantic for the moment. He tore at the unresponsive surface with impotent hands and
            a maddened brain until many spots were stained with the blood of his cruel efforts. The
            uselessness of it all, however, soon calmed his desperation and, well nigh exhausted, he
            allowed himself to drift idly along, keeping himself afloat with one hand while the
            other he dragged slowly along the menacing wall, ready to clutch at the first knob or
            embrasure that offered a hold to his tingling fingers. Though how to scale the cliff,
            granted a foothold gained, was a problem of which he would not let himself think until
            the time came to grapple with it, hand to hand. There would be time enough then to find
            a way or--not to find a way.</p>
          <p>Thank God, he had not drifted beyond Ole Johnson&apos;s gulch after all. A warmth
            came back to his heart, the old fire leaped into the gray eyes <pb n="262"
              id="VAA3895-260"/>that had looked so closely upon death, and so gallantly. Once more
            it was his to shape his course and pursue it. Ah, but the feel of it was good!</p>
          <p>He bounded upon the shore, ran swiftly along the jagged way unmindful of his unshod
            feet, until he came to the longed-for gap in the hills. In the shortest time possible
            for the accomplishment thereof, he had made known his wants to Ole Johnson, a bachelor
            Scandinavian, a recluse by habit, but a humanitarian by instinct, else he never had
            given over his loved thoroughbred to such a dare-devil rider on such a dare-devil
            errand, and was in the saddle, rebelted with Ole&apos;s own cartridge belt and armed
            with his pistols, and was cutting across the sun-seared plain on the trail of the man
            with the baby blue eyes who had told him once that &quot;He must be
            a-movin&apos; on.&quot;</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XVII</head>
          <head>BURRINGTON JOINS THE CHASE</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">W</hi>HEN he came out upon the main road, he noted with a feeling of
            intense relief that the tracks of pursuer and pursued were plainly stamped thereon. The
            rain had wrought well for his peace of mind, for as yet there were no signs of
            Josephine&apos;s having been overtaken. The regularity of the hoof-prints remained
            unbroken for many a mile with no faltering of the one, as if the hand that guided had
            been suddenly struck down, and with no perceptible quickening of the other as if in a
            sudden burst of triumphant recognition of a weakening on the part of her who rode ahead.
            A hope, faintly illusive in the beginning but gradually growing stronger and more
            abiding, took possession of him--a hope that Josephine had not been taken unawares, that
            she had been on her guard from the first and had been miles in the lead before ever this
            chopper of wood had crossed the river. As for the horse she rode, there was no danger
            but that he would become infused with the spirit of <pb n="264" id="VAA3895-262"/>the
            chase at the first hint of an unfriendly presence in his rear. He had good blood in him
            and had fleetness of foot and an unusual strength of endurance without the vicious
            unreliability of the average mongrel range-bred bronco. He had also been broken and
            trained by a proud master. He now stood as an accurate exponent of the pride of man
            combined with the pride of beast. Tom could not know what manner of horse-flesh Henry
            Hoffman was astride, but he knew that this quondam cowboy had ridden away from the
            Seven-up on that never-to-be-forgotten morning when the ice went out, upon a
            rough-coated, tangle-tailed, calico pony with an antagonistic gleam in his eyes and an
            innate aversion to undue haste. These same characteristics had won for him, during his
            brief sojourn, immunity from active service, because there was no time to waste at the
            Seven-up; and so the pony had been allowed to wander and feast undisturbed upon the good
            grass lands, while the man whom he had grudgingly carried to this undreamed-of horse
            heaven, snubbed other mistaken beasts and rode them to cattle. Frank LaDue owned no
            thoroughbreds; hence the man had gained little, even granting that he had discarded the
            calico <pb n="265" id="VAA3895-263"/>pony for an uncertain mount borrowed from the
            indifferent horse herd of the islander. There were good grounds for the warmth of faith
            that Tom hugged to himself as Ole Johnson&apos;s horse ate up the distance in
            voracious mouthfuls. Little need was there of boot or spur. The tap of Tom&apos;s
            bare heel was incentive enough and to spare for the best efforts of an animal already on
            its mettle.</p>
          <p>By far the greater portion of the distance was well behind him and the breath of an
            involuntary prayer of thanksgiving had but just escaped his undemonstrative lips when
            two riders appeared before his strained gaze--perhaps a mile ahead of him--perhaps more.
            They were much too far removed for him to see the muscular play of the cruel struggle
            for more speed when their speed was already so great they seemed to be skimming over the
            way like birds. After his set-back in crossing the river, he had not dared to believe
            that he might over-take them. Surely Josephine had loitered on the way, and as surely
            for some purpose that he could not fathom, Henry had lingered, too. Why? He did not wait
            for an answer to the half-formed question in his mind, but, digging his heels once more
            in the animal&apos;s sides, he bent his <pb n="266" id="VAA3895-264"/>head, and the
            horse that had seemingly been already doing its best sprang forward with a new impetus,
            so that the light breeze which had come out of the north after the storm pressed like a
            strong wind and finally lifted his heavy hat from his head and deposited it upon the
            road far behind. He let it lie where it fell. One of those figures ahead had much
            advantage in the lead. It was Josephine, of course; but could she maintain it? At any
            moment might not the man cut short this ghastly play by means of a bullet? He tingled
            with the dread of the sound of a shot, and then caught his breath sharply with the fear
            that he might not hear it should it occur, but the wind was with him and Josephine still
            rode unhampered and with a fine grip of herself.</p>
          <p>My God! Had it come? The report of a rifle came floating back upon the wind. Josephine
            still kept her seat, but all at once she seemed to be losing ground. Had she or the
            horse been hit, or had he overestimated the horse&apos;s endurance? Just two short
            miles beyond the grove of trees lay the town on the bluff side, and behind--less than a
            mile now--so close that if he only had his rifle its carrying power might even now put a
            sudden end to this terrible strain--so close <pb n="267" id="VAA3895-265"/>that if he
            failed in his mission he should simply turn stern, accusing eyes to the distant sky,
            curse the grinning fates that tantalized, and die-rode the man who loved her with his
            whole strong heart. But what could his strength avail her now? The man would certainly
            shoot her before he could get close enough to stop him. He noticed that she again seemed
            to be gaining. &quot;Oh, Josephine! Josephine!&quot; he breathed, not realizing
            that he spoke aloud, so great was the stress of his effort and the fear of what might at
            any moment now stay her in her gallant race for life. &quot;If you can only keep up
            a little longer I may be able to help you.&quot;</p>
          <p>He heard another shot and saw Josephine disappear around the grove. As Henry neared the
            turning point, Tom, with the forlorn hope that the staring distance would carry the
            sound of it to the ears of the man who was about to follow into the blankness beyond the
            trees and warn him that he was not alone with his fell design, seized his pistol, so
            ineffectual at that distance, and shot rapidly many times into the face of the wind, nor
            did he desist until Henry, too, had disappeared from sight. For the first time since the
            precipitous wall, whose foundation had been bathed <pb n="268" id="VAA3895-266"/>in the
            turbulent waters of the June rise, had presented itself immutably to his impotent hands,
            utter hopelessness laid hold of him coldly.</p>
          <p>He drew in his horse somewhat when he came to the turn, for it seemed to him that he
            could not bear to see what he dreaded had come to pass. But the way opened before him,
            straight, sunny, deserted, save for a runty calico pony that grazed by the wayside. How
            many, many times in the years gone by had it stretched before him thus and yet--In the
            momentary bewilderment that preceded comprehension, a rifle shot rang out sharply in the
            waiting silence. He heard the bullet whistle purringly past him, felt against his
            bronzed cheek the slight, cool breath of the displaced air, and with the quick
            conclusion that Henry Hoffman lay in ambush for him, he jerked his horse back upon its
            haunches simultaneously with the act of again seizing the pistol that had been returned
            to its holster; but at that moment a slim, girlish, blue-clad figure with dishevelled
            yellow hair, a white face, and wide, appealing eyes ran out from somewhere among the
            trees and stood panting before him.</p>
          <p>&quot;Did I kill you?&quot; There was a sharp agony in her voice.</p>
          <pb n="269" id="VAA3895-267"/>
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t I look very much alive?&quot; asked Tom, with a little
            unsteady laugh of relief as he threw himself from his horse. &quot;I feel alive, I
            assure you, very much so in fact. Oh, yes, my hat! No wonder you were alarmed. I must
            look sort of savage and no mistake. Why, I left that back a ways. I had n&apos;t any
            real use for it, you know. You will perceive that I have dispensed with all
            superfluities of dress,&quot; he continued, glancing deprecatingly at his bare feet
            and talking just to try to talk away the woe in her eyes. He was breathing heavily from
            his late exertions. &quot;And so it was you, little woman, and not Henry, after all,
            who had it in for me. Who ever would have thought that you desired my blood?&quot;
            he rallied her, softly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t!&quot; she besought, so sorrowfully that he desisted and
            was silent. &quot;Why have you left Jack?&quot; she accused, suddenly, calling
            him to account unshrinkingly because of a revival of that old suspicion that there had
            been something he ought to have told them. She took firm hold of her self-control so
            that she should betray no sign of weakness before this man who might, if he would, have
            prevented Jack&apos;s murder. &quot;You have broken your promise. I did wrong to
            trust <pb n="270" id="VAA3895-268"/>you. Your leaving him is in keeping with--other
            things that you have done. Why are you here? Why do you not go on your way? We do not
            need you--Jack and I.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I left Rosebud in charge at the Broken Key,&quot; said Tom, steadily,
            though he bowed his head to conceal the pain that gripped him at this second
            manifestation of aversion and suspicion. &quot;We thought that you were in great
            danger because we saw Henry Hoffman taking your trail. So I came and she stayed. What
            has become of Henry?&quot; he asked, dully, his eyes straying for a moment to the
            calico pony feeding by the roadside, flecks of foam still lurking about his neck and
            flanks.</p>
          <p>&quot;I killed him,&quot; said Josephine, in a sort of calm despair.
            &quot;I slipped into the woods there and hid and waited and when he came around the
            corner, I shot him. He is dead. I dragged him in there out of sight--he was very heavy
            and he killed Jack, but I had to do it, did n&apos;t I? There was no other way. So I
            carried him there--but oh, I did hate him so and when I had to put my arms around him, I
            shut my eyes tight to keep from shooting him again. He is in there now. He is so
            helpless. I shot him, you know. He is lying <pb n="271" id="VAA3895-269"/>down on the
            wet grass and his blue eyes are closed--they were just like a baby&apos;s, were
            n&apos;t they?&quot; she questioned irrationally.</p>
          <p>Tom could not speak, but he took the cold hands in a strong, warm clasp and held them
            thus.</p>
          <p>&quot;And then I heard some one else coming. I thought at first it was a
            dream,&quot; she continued, &quot;it sounded just as things sound in a dream.
            But after a while, I knew that it was not a dream and it came to me all of a sudden that
            it must be Frank LaDue. I do not know why it was not Frank LaDue, do you? He hated Jack
            so. It must have been LaDue--but it was not--it was you--and so I shot at
            you.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;But you did not hit me at all, Josephine,&quot; said Tom, quietly.
            &quot;Your bullet lies out there on the prairie somewhere. It is a lucky thing for
            me, I am thinking, that Louis has his limitations as instructor in the canny art of
            firearms. Come, show me where you laid him.&quot;</p>
          <p>She withdrew her hands quickly from his grasp and led the way to the place where the
            blue-eyed boy lay. Upon reaching the spot, she turned away in a strong revulsion of
            feeling, for the man had struggled to a partial sitting posture and <pb n="272"
              id="VAA3895-270"/>was leaning against the same cottonwood tree that had sheltered
            Josephine while she waited for those other footsteps to come nearer. He was pale from
            loss of blood but composed and almost apologetic in his attitude of feeble reproach.</p>
          <p>&quot;Gee! But you can shoot, girl,&quot; he said, glancing dubiously at
            Burrington, as they approached. &quot;Or were you aimin&apos; at me?&quot;
            he questioned, jocularly. &quot;I &apos;ve known women folks before that could
            hit almost anything they were n&apos;t aimin&apos; at. What made you do it,
            girl? What have I ever done to you? Ain&apos;t you Jack Carroll&apos;s sister?
            Why, we&apos;re neighbors, did n&apos;t you know that? Considerin&apos; that
            fact, it wasn&apos;t just white for you to treat me like this--now, was
            it?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Shut up, Henry, will you?&quot; interrupted Tom, sternly. &quot;We do
            not want any of that nonsense. It won&apos;t do you any good and you are only
            wasting breath. We know all about everything. Just keep still, will you?&quot;</p>
          <p>He knelt as he spoke to ascertain the amount of injury the man had sustained.</p>
          <p>&quot;Sure thing, Tom, if you say the word. But I certainly would like to know why
            the girl&apos;s got it in for me.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="273" id="VAA3895-271"/>
          <p>&quot;You--you--were following me,&quot; accused Josephine, chokingly,
            &quot;and you shot at me.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you ever believe it,&quot; protested the man, earnestly.
            &quot;I was just ridin&apos; to town to see Boss Frank. I was ridin&apos;
            like the devil, I admit that, but that &apos;s just my way. I was raised a cowboy,
            you know. I just shot to attract your attention, so you would stop and wait for me. I
            never dreamed I was scarin&apos; you. Why,&quot; he continued, turning to Tom,
            &quot;many a time I &apos;ve seen her about the island or crossin&apos; that
            big gulch on their place, drivin&apos; the cows home, singin&apos; purty-like to
            herself, with the sunset on that yeller hair.&quot; His cheeks flushed and he
            brushed his arm before his eyes. &quot;Frank always said it wasn&apos;t a
            woman&apos;s work,&quot; he concluded abruptly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why did you kill Jack?&quot; demanded Josephine, suddenly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Is that boy dead?&quot; he asked with intense agitation.</p>
          <p>&quot;You ought to know. You killed him,&quot; said Josephine, steadily.</p>
          <p>&quot;I do not know what you have against me,&quot; said Henry, slowly.
            &quot;I never chased you and I never killed your brother. I was coming to town to
            see Frank about haulin&apos; some wood over <pb n="274" id="VAA3895-272"/>to the
            Agency. I never killed nobody in my life--never killed nothin&apos; but just coyotes
            and the likes of them.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;It will be better not to say anything more now, Miss Carroll,&quot;
            advised Burrington, formally, as he arose to his feet. &quot;Leave him to me. I will
            take care of him. It will be better for the sheriff to come here for him. He is in
            pretty bad shape. You will have to go on alone after all; but nothing can hurt you now.
            See Sheriff Dennison the very first thing. Tell him to bring three or four men with him.
            You must remain in Velpen. Go directly to the hotel when you have seen the sheriff and I
            will send my mother in to you as soon as I get back. I will go with the officers to the
            Broken Key and come back with Jack. It will be far better so. You will mind me,
            won&apos;t you?&quot; he asked, with something of appeal struggling through the
            business-like formality of his directions.</p>
          <p>She shook her head, springing into the saddle seemingly without seeing his
            out-stretched hand.</p>
          <p>&quot;I tell you that you must,&quot; he said authoritatively. &quot;It
            will be far better so. Your long ride would count for nothing, as we are coming directly
            back. You are worn out and--you will <pb n="275" id="VAA3895-273"/>need all of your
            strength. If--you do not trust me, I will let the men go to the Broken Key alone. You
            will stay?&quot;</p>
          <p>She looked at him for a moment, silently, then turned and slipped out into the road and
            he knew, with an irritating sense of his utter powerlessness to control her, that she
            would return with the men who were to come to bear John Calhoun Carroll within the
            sheltering arms of the law, which had struck, for him, too late.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>
          <head>THE BROKEN KEY DESERTED</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">A</hi>LL that was mortal of the young Southerner was to be taken back to
            the old home and laid to rest in the ancient burial ground where so many generations of
            his people were sleeping. Geoffrey Goodman, the last of kin on the mother&apos;s
            side, was to meet the sad little procession at Sioux City. So Josephine had arranged and
            so her plans were carried out.</p>
          <p>When the spring wagon that was to carry Josephine and the Burringtons to Velpen was
            driven down through the Gap on the opposite shore and a vibrant hail had sounded to the
            waiting ones in the claim shanty of the Broken Key, Rosebud arose from her posture of
            silent, gloomy dejection by the table, which was still strewn with the papers and
            magazines that were never to be read, and glided wordlessly toward the open door. In her
            movements, there was a haunting, new hint of the gait of the women of the Dakotahs, the
            burden bearers of their race. Hitherto, her step had always been unusually elastic and
            untrammelled. Josephine followed her.</p>
          <pb n="277" id="VAA3895-275"/>
          <p>&quot;I wish you were going with us, Rosebud,&quot; she said, resting her right
            arm around the Indian girl&apos;s shoulders. &quot;Won&apos;t you change
            your mind and go?&quot;</p>
          <p>Rosebud shook her head. Her dark hair was braided, an unusual mode for it of late, and
            fell below her waist in two long plaits.</p>
          <p>&quot;The mother of the Seven-up goes with you. There is no need of Onjijitka, the
            Indian girl.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I do need you, Rosebud,&quot; said Josephine, soberly. &quot;Do you
            forget how few my friends in Dakota are? I shall miss you when I get on the train. I
            shall look for you and you will not be there. It will be very lonely for me,
            Rosebud.&quot;</p>
          <p>The girl hesitated. There were just the three present. Tom had gone down to the landing
            to get the boat in readiness. It was hard for her to speak her thoughts to Josephine
            alone--impossible in the presence of the stately mother of Tom, however kindly the elder
            woman&apos;s attitude toward her had always been. Her habit of repression, inherited
            from many generations, prevented any manifestation of feeling and held her outwardly
            unresponsive to Josephine&apos;s appeal.</p>
          <p>&quot;Onjijitka is sorry,&quot; she said at last, slowly, <pb n="278"
              id="VAA3895-276"/>&quot;but she cannot go. Is Josephine Carroll coming back to the
            plains country?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I do not know. I do not think so,&quot; said Josephine, with a little
            shudder. &quot;You are changed, Rosebud. I cannot understand why, but somehow you
            seem different. Oh, I wish, I wish that you were coming South with me,&quot; she
            cried, suddenly, throwing her arms around Rosebud&apos;s neck and kissing her
            passionately. &quot;You knew him, too! Do not forget me, Rosebud! Maybe I shall come
            back. Good-bye! Good-bye!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot; Good-bye, Josephine,&quot; said Rosebud, but still she did not go. There
            was something else she must say if she could. She shifted her position uneasily. Mrs.
            Burrington was watching her curiously. She tried to appear stolidly indifferent to the
            parting because of this frank inspection and she tried to make herself go and leave
            unsaid that which something was forcing her to say.</p>
          <p>&quot;We must go, Josephine, dear child,&quot; said Mrs. Burrington, at last.
            &quot;Tom is waiting.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You are right,&quot; replied Josephine, strangely loath to go and leave
            Rosebud standing there alone, although she could not have explained <pb n="279"
              id="VAA3895-277"/>any reason for the feeling of reluctance. &quot;We must go.
            Good-bye, Rosebud.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Good-bye, Josephine,&quot; said Rosebud, and then it came, slowly and
            with difficulty, what she had so long wanted to say. &quot;If you will come back to
            the Broken Key, I will leave Two Hawks and come and live with you. I will do the
            man&apos;s work--the ploughing, the planting, and the harvesting, the milking and
            the riding to cattle. You, Josephine, you can keep the house--pretty. I--I--cannot bear
            to think that cobwebs will grow over the door of the Broken Key.&quot;</p>
          <p>She did not wait for an answer but slipped away and soon disappeared into the timber,
            her moccasined feet gliding forward, catlike, as she pursued her way--not in the
            direction of the outlying hut of Two Hawks, who had established himself practically on
            the very borders of the Reservation and who, under the constant and untiring promptings
            of his educated step-daughter, was attempting to farm in an easy, shiftless
            fashion,--but right out into the heart of the illimitable and shimmering prairie, where
            the spirits of the ancient Sioux still lurked in the rustling grasses, and the sighing
            winds, and the white clouds that drifted sometimes caress- <pb n="280" id="VAA3895-278"
            />ingly over the sunny plains where they used to dwell.</p>
          <p>&quot;What a strange girl Rosebud is,&quot; said Mrs. Burrington. She closed
            the little square window carefully and drew the blinds close. &quot;Why do you
            suppose she refused to go to Velpen with us?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I do not know,&quot; said Josephine, dreamily. &quot;I am grateful to
            her for her offer. It would be a great sacrifice on her part. The sisters at Notre Dame
            have written to her to come back there and help teach the young children. She had almost
            decided to do so. I do not know what she will do now. She is different, don&apos;t
            you think so, too? I wish that I had asked her to come sometimes and--sweep down the
            cobwebs from the door. I think she would have done it for me. Come, let us go, Mrs.
            Burrington,&quot; she continued, restlessly. &quot;It is so sombre in here with
            the blinds drawn. Oh, please, throw away those flowers first--they would be so dead if I
            should ever come back. We are ready now, are we not?&quot;</p>
          <p>They closed the door behind them and locked it.</p>
          <p>&quot;Jack never locked it--poor Jack,&quot; whispered <pb n="281"
              id="VAA3895-279"/>Josephine, blindly. &quot;Good-bye, Broken Key. You will never
            be the same any more.&quot; Then she turned and walked resolutely away down the
            narrow trail to the wagon road.</p>
          <p>Tom accompanied her to Sioux City. He did not ask her permission. He went, despite the
            keenness with which he felt her late and wholly unexpected attitude of suspicion toward
            him, simply because it seemed as if he were the only one to go. The Broken Key was an
            isolated claim. The Carrolls had formed few intimate friendships; but it was generally
            understood that a close bond of mutual liking existed between the household of the
            wealthy Seven-up and the aristocratic young Southerners. People took it for granted,
            therefore, that Tom Burrington would do all there was to do. He had no choice but to
            bury his pain and his pride for the time being and to assume, as unobtrusively as might
            be, the responsibilities of the sad journey. And Josephine? If he went against her will
            she gave no sign. She was alone. This man had professed to be Jack&apos;s friend.
            Jack had trusted him--stay--had Jack trusted him altogether--without reservation and
            without question? From her heart she believed so and yet--Jack had said, <pb n="282"
              id="VAA3895-280"/>&quot;I am afraid, Josephine, that Tom knows.&quot; Thinking
            thus, she cried her old cry, &quot;If he knew, why did he not tell us?&quot; and
            it was an exceedingly bitter cry now. But she could not forbid his attendance upon the
            body of his friend just because, without real foundation even, she had begun to mistrust
            the motives that had actuated him in his constant friendliness toward both her and Jack.
            Would she have forbidden it if she could? Because of the relief that she experienced on
            account of the grave, helpful way in which he went about the performance of his
            self-imposed duties, and with a fine perception held himself personally aloof from her
            companionship, she wished, from the bottom of her heart, that she might banish once and
            for all that disquieting, constantly recurring suspicion, fight it as she would, that
            Tom knew something that might have saved Jack&apos;s life had he told it in time.
            She was grateful for the comfort his masterful presence gave her, and she tried hard not
            to ask herself that bitter question--but she could not altogether forget.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Burrington had been compelled to let the train slip over the rails eastward bound
            leaving her standing upon the platform alone. There <pb n="283" id="VAA3895-281"/>was
            Louis and there were manifold duties besides which claimed her divided but scrupulously
            honest attentions. When she climbed into the wagon for her return journey to the
            Seven-up, she felt very lonely and like an old woman, and longed unaccountably for
            companionship; even the companionship of the Indian girl, upon whom she had looked with
            such curious aloofness but yesterday, would have been thrice welcome to-day.</p>
          <p>&quot;Drive home quickly, Charlie,&quot; she ordered, &quot;but do let us
            go by way of White River.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, White River &apos;s on a gallopin&apos; rampage,
            ma&apos;am,&quot; said the cowboy, emphatically. &quot;There won&apos;t
            be any crossin&apos; there for two weeks, anyway. There ain&apos;t no other way
            but just to go by Frank LaDue&apos;s and cross at the ferry.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;If we must, we must,&quot; said Mrs. Burrington, resignedly. &quot;I
            had hoped not to pass anywhere near there--not to-day. The look in that girl&apos;s
            eyes will haunt me as long as I live. But there, hurry along. What has to be, has to be,
            and Louis is crying his heart out this minute for that boy who is gone. Hurry along, do,
            please, Charlie.&quot;</p>
          <p>At Sioux City, the little party was met by <pb n="284" id="VAA3895-282"/>Geoffrey
            Goodman, who immediately assumed charge of all the arrangements and Tom
            Burrington&apos;s further services were not required. He watched the train glide
            away from the station of the &quot;jumping-off-place,&quot; as Jack had dubbed
            it once in happy raillery, his lively fancy so naming it because here was reached the
            limit of through train service, and more especially because here came all who would take
            the trail for the northwest country, and then he turned away with a heavy heart.</p>
          <p>Josephine&apos;s plans reached their culmination when a gray-haired man and a
            lonely girl, accompanied only by a handful of gentlefolks, representatives of other old
            and failing families, and a scattering of white-headed colored people, former retainers
            who had spent their youth in the service of the grandfather of this generation, and
            perhaps by the brooding spirits of the dead, stood within a green-walled enclosure where
            ivy and Virginia creeper ran riot, where the crepe myrtle with its luxuriance of pink
            blossoms made spots of pretty color in restful contrast to the varying shades of rank
            green, where there was no jarring insistence of the ostentatious new to caricature the
            solemn slumber of centuries, and watched the <pb n="285" id="VAA3895-283"/>laying away
            of the last male Carroll. He had hearkened to the lure of the great West that was
            opening to the steady progression of the American people and had fallen by the way, an
            uncanonized martyr to civilization, the costliest thing on earth, next to the sin of the
            world.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XIX</head>
          <head>HENRY CONFESSES</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">W</hi>HEN Burrington returned to Velpen, the cowboy Mason, with a led
            horse, was waiting for him.</p>
          <p>&quot;Put the beast in the stable, Charlie, will you, and then ride on out home.
            Tell mother that I shall not be there for two or three days. I have business that will
            keep me in town for at least that length of time. Keep things going, boy. So
            long.&quot;</p>
          <p>He turned and walked up the inclined street with long, rapid strides. It seemed
            strangely desolate, uncommonly crude, despite the glory of the late sunlight that shone
            slantingly, warmly, and cheerfully, upon the side to the east and filtered through the
            crevices between the western line of wooden buildings; despite the unusual number of
            saddled bronchos standing patiently in front of saloon and hotel, and the
            service-scarred buckboards wedged in alongside. The news of the tragedy had gone forth
            to the surrounding country where the farmer and the homesteader held sway and had
            re-crossed the river and pene- <pb n="287" id="VAA3895-285"/>trated into the very heart
            of the range country, as well, so that the little border cow town was crowded with the
            curious, the interested, the knowing, the inquiring, the condemnatory, the neutral, and
            the quietly elated; for there were those who resented heartily the west-of-the-river
            encroachments of the homesteader. These were all met together to try the culprit, to
            judge him, to hang him or to imprison him for life, or may-hap to release him; and
            during the procedure of the mock trial, whiskey flowed profusely and cigarettes were
            rolled and consumed, seemingly in the twinkling of an eye. But the unusual air of
            excitement rampant in the street, and the unaccustomed noisy hilarity that issued from
            certain popular places of resort and which was engendered by the sociability which in
            turn traces its source to much strong whiskey, affected the young ranchman depressingly,
            and in his heart was a poignant yearning for the girl whose absence made the coming
            evening and all that it shadowed drearily sad, unspeakably lonely.</p>
          <p>He had not gone far when he met Dennison, the sheriff.</p>
          <p>&quot;How is your prisoner?&quot; he asked him, abruptly.</p>
          <pb n="288" id="VAA3895-286"/>
          <p>&quot;Pretty well, considerin&apos;.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;He will recover?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Sure thing. A little flesh wound is all that ails him. He &apos;s the
            halest and heartiest deader ever I saw, damme. And the girl thought she had done for
            him. If that ain&apos;t sure a good one!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Has he said anything?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You mean about things--in general?&quot; asked the sheriff, with
            provoking elaboration.</p>
          <p>&quot;I mean about the shooting,&quot; said Tom, curtly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Not a word. He &apos;s glum as a buckin&apos; broncho whenever the
            subject &apos;s broached and as uncommunicative as a mischief-hatchin&apos;
            Injun.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;May I see him to-night, Dennison?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Should n&apos;t wonder. Don&apos;t believe he &apos;s
            hankerin&apos; to see you, though, Tom. I don&apos;t, for a fact.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Has he expressed himself to that effect?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, no, I can&apos;t say that he has, exactly. He used to outride for
            you, did n&apos;t he, before he went to choppin&apos; wood?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;He was in my employ for almost a year. He was a good hand at cattle. Shall we
            go to the jail now?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Ain&apos;t you goin&apos; to get no supper first?&quot; <pb
              n="289" id="VAA3895-287"/>asked the leathery-skinned Sheriff Dennison, in
            surprise.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am not hungry and it is getting late. It may be that a conversation with
            Henry will whet my appetite. Come, shall we go there at once?&quot;</p>
          <p>A few minutes later Dennison closed the ponderous door of the jail upon Burrington with
            the good-natured remark, &quot;Time unlimited,&quot; and sauntered leisurely
            away. The failing light that made its way through the barred window fell dimly upon the
            room and its occupant. The prisoner was lying flat upon his comfortless couch and he did
            not look up at the sound of the closing door nor the sheriff&apos;s parting words of
            gratuitous permission for an indefinite stay. Tom approached the prostrate figure.</p>
          <p>&quot;Hello, Henry,&quot; he said, in a friendly greeting.</p>
          <p>He had determined, for the best interests of the cause upon which he was henceforth
            bent, to suppress in himself all weakening and dangerous dwelling upon thoughts of
            &quot;the long chase&quot; during the present conversation, and had fortified
            himself well for the coming combat of his wit against the other&apos;s taciturnity
            and of reason <pb n="290" id="VAA3895-288"/>against his own personal inclination, which
            was up in arms to do physical violence to this mockery of a man who lay there before him
            so sullenly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Hello,&quot; vouchsafed the prisoner, laconically.</p>
          <p>&quot;How is the gun-shot?&quot; asked Tom, drawing the only chair in the room
            to the bedside and seating himself. &quot;It is healing nicely, Dennison tells me.
            Do you suffer much, Henry?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Enough,&quot; was the ungracious response.</p>
          <p>&quot;Tell me all about it, won&apos;t you, Henry?&quot; asked Tom, coming
            to the point with the intuitive perception that something lay heavy on the young
            fellow&apos;s mind. There was a hunted look in his eyes and he fingered the coverlet
            restlessly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why should I? You ain&apos;t no friend o&apos; mine,&quot; said
            Henry, bluntly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Do not be too sure of that,&quot; said Tom, slowly. &quot;Maybe I
            don&apos;t exactly love you. I do not think you really expect that, after all that
            has happened. But you know me pretty well, do you not? I am capable of befriending a man
            without loving him. You are pressingly in need of a friend, my boy, don&apos;t you
            realize that? Did I ever play you dirt while you were at the Seven-up?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You sure never did,&quot; protested the prisoner, <pb n="291"
              id="VAA3895-289"/>earnestly. He propped himself up on his pillow after giving his
            supposedly unwelcome visitor this assurance and turned haggard eyes upon him for the
            first time. &quot;You were always square with us boys,&quot; he added,
            gratefully.</p>
          <p>&quot;I always meant to be and--mean to be. You are pretty young, are you not? I do
            not believe that you are a day over twenty-one. I cannot promise you the leniency of the
            court, Henry, but I think that you will do well to make confession. I think that your
            age and evident contrition and--willingness to do all that is in your power to help
            along the cause of justice, even to the giving up of yourself as an earnest of your
            sincerity, will be taken into consideration. I say this to you in all honesty. I am
            telling you nothing that I do not have faith in, myself, and my years and experience are
            many more than yours.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why are you takin&apos; all this trouble? If you think I am guilty, why
            do you want an easy sentence for me?&quot; asked Henry, unexpectedly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Because I believe that there is one more to blame than you are.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;What if I tell you that I did n&apos;t do it--and I did
            n&apos;t--&quot; said Henry, feverishly. &quot;You <pb n="292"
              id="VAA3895-290"/>could n&apos;t do nothin&apos; to me then. How could you
            prove that I done anything that I never done, I&apos;d like to know? You
            &apos;re just workin&apos; me to give myself up. It shows how plumb weak you are
            on evidence against me.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Do you want me to tell you what I shall do?&quot; asked Tom, rising.
            &quot;Well, I will tell you, since you ask me. I am a pretty good witness against
            you, Henry, myself. I shall begin by telling the court and the jury about that little
            affair in the gulch, you know.&quot;</p>
          <p>He paused to note the effect of his unexpected onslaught. The prisoner sat straight up
            and in his answer was a quick and burning excitement.</p>
          <p>&quot;My God, Tom! That was a gray wolf you shot at!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;How do you know?&quot; asked Tom, coolly, well pleased at this
            unmistakable corroboration of his suspicion as to the identity of the man in the
            gulch.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, I met the wench in the woods the next day and she told me,&quot; he
            lied, unconvincingly.</p>
          <p>&quot;And what ails your wrist that you keep it bound up so carefully?&quot;
            pursued Tom, relentlessly. He did not fail to note the glance of startled rage which
            Henry bestowed first upon <pb n="293" id="VAA3895-291"/>the challenged wrist and then
            upon his questioner. &quot;You evidently have some foundation for that seemingly
            random shot about the gray wolf,&quot; continued Tom, thoughtfully. &quot;I did
            n&apos;t see you that morning down at the woodpile when I explained the subterfuge
            to--Mr. Carroll.&quot; He could not bring himself to speak the old, familiar
            monosyllabic name &quot;Jack&quot; in this presence. &quot;But doubtless you
            were there somewhere in hiding. Well, I shall embellish that tale some, Henry. I shall
            tell how I saw Josephine Carroll go down into the valley--&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t, Mr. Burrington,&quot; interrupted Henry, huskily.
            &quot;I can&apos;t stand it. I&apos;ll see the sun on that girl&apos;s
            shinin&apos; hair just before she went down into the valley to my dyin&apos;
            day. She was singin&apos; along soft-like to herself--I could hear her just as
            plain--the evenin&apos; was so still. When I heard the first sound of
            rollin&apos; dirt that the leader of the herd had dislodged when he started down the
            path, I knew the time had come and I crouched down in a little side washout and waited.
            The first heifer was well-nigh up t&apos;other bank before she came to the edge of
            the gulch. Oh, Lord! She was purty! Her yeller hair was so bright and her hat was off
            and she was singin&apos; <pb n="294" id="VAA3895-292"/>so soft and sweet. I never
            wanted to kill a woman, nohow.&quot; His voice trailed off into mournful bitterness.
            &quot;I don&apos;t know why in hell I ever said I would. I must have been crazy.
            Anyway, I just could n&apos;t do it when the time come. Why, I ain&apos;t a
            plumb brute, Mr. Burrington. I--just could n&apos;t kill that purty girl
            ridin&apos; down that steep bank so unconscious-like and singin&apos; so soft.
            She was n&apos;t lookin&apos; for foul play. Why should she have been? She had
            never done any harm to anybody. Not a mite in all the world--and I just could
            n&apos;t do it. I tried--I tried hard--I was afraid not to. I tried three or four
            times. I pointed my rifle at her true all those times, but I could n&apos;t pull the
            trigger. If she&apos;d glanced my way--or stopped her singin&apos;--or showed
            any scare--I might have done it, but she did n&apos;t do any of those things. She
            just kept on her way so purty and unsuspectin&apos; and I could n&apos;t do it.
            I&apos;d lower every time. But I had to do it, so I tried again and--this time I
            pulled.&quot; In the deep dusk, Tom clenched his hands while perspiration started
            from his body till he prickled with the damp heat of it. &quot;But--someway--I
            don&apos;t know how it happened--I done it so quick--I slipped a finger in between,
            and the <pb n="295" id="VAA3895-293"/>hammer could n&apos;t reach the cap of the
            cartridge through my finger, so there was n&apos;t any concussion after all. Then
            you came, and I slipped away and crossed the rock reef back to the island.&quot;</p>
          <p>He seemed exhausted by his impulsive recital and lay back on his pillow, breathing
            heavily. Tom was silent a moment, waiting for him to recover; then he asked,
            gravely:</p>
          <p>&quot;Why did you shoot Mr. Carroll, Henry?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I had to,&quot; said the young fellow, &quot;there was no other way
            out of the mix-up.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why did Frank LaDue want him out of the way?&quot; asked Tom,
            searchingly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Ask him,&quot; said Henry, with a prompt return to his former attitude of
            dogged reserve. Tom changed his tactics immediately. He had already discovered that the
            most satisfactory results from this interview were to be derived from keeping in close
            touch with the subject of Josephine.</p>
          <p>&quot;I cannot understand, Henry,&quot; he began, meditatively, &quot;why,
            if, as you say, you had thoroughly made up your mind that you could not, under any
            circumstances, make away with the life of a woman, you yet gave such monstrous, <pb
              n="296" id="VAA3895-294"/>inhuman chase to Josephine Carroll so soon afterward. It
            strikes me as rather an anomalous proceeding in view of your recent and reiterated
            declaration.&quot;</p>
          <p>The man hesitated for a moment; then he put this question to his interlocutor,
            suddenly, unexpectedly: &quot;Will you give me your word of honor that you
            won&apos;t give him away--if I tell you all about it?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you tell me--without the promise?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Not one word,&quot; returned Henry, sullenly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Then I promise--until you yourself release me from the pledge.&quot;</p>
          <p>The simple promise needed no bolstering of words. Henry asked for none, but proceeded
            at once:</p>
          <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care for myself--you&apos;re dead on to me; besides, I
            can&apos;t get that yeller-haired girl out of my mind. But he--Frank--why, he
            &apos;d kill me if he knew I &apos;d told on him. I don&apos;t know how he
            came to get such a hold on me. I met him for the first time soon after I went to the
            Broken Key to help out while he--Carroll, you know-was laid up with a broken leg. I wish
            to the Lord I &apos;d never set eyes on him! I wish <pb n="297" id="VAA3895-295"/>to
            the Lord I &apos;d never a-left the old Seven-up. The Carrolls&apos; cows took
            to strayin&apos; over to the island and I run across him one day when I was over
            there lookin&apos; for a runaway heifer. He asked me where I was from and seemed
            nice and friendly. When I told him I was a sort o&apos; rollin&apos; stone and
            had been in lots o&apos; places since I was knee-high-to-a-grasshopper, he said if I
            ever got tired o&apos; my job at the Seven-up, why, he had a good place for a likely
            feller like me that would pay more than herdin&apos; cattle. We talked considerable.
            I remember his goin&apos; on a good deal about settlers comin&apos; in and
            spoilin&apos; the ranges for the cattlemen. That sounded all right to me, for they
            were makin&apos; the same sort o&apos; kick down in Texas, where I started from,
            and they were talkin&apos; the same sort o&apos; stuff all along the line.
            I&apos;ve even heard you sort o&apos; cuss the luck yourself, Tom, though you
            always &apos;lowed it had to come. And then he began on Miss Carroll. He asked me
            what I thought o&apos; her, and asked me was n&apos;t she a bold jade, though? I
            thought he was just foolin&apos;, but it seemed as if he &apos;d begun to hate
            the girl even then. He sure hated her a plenty.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, Henry?&quot;</p>
          <pb n="298" id="VAA3895-296"/>
          <p>&quot;You &apos;ll have to ask him, Tom,&quot; said Henry, evasively.
            &quot;I never understood exactly. He was always talkin&apos; about
            spoilin&apos; the ranges. That was all bluff, though. He did n&apos;t give a
            tinker&apos;s damn whether the ranges was spoiled or not, or how many homesteaders
            crossed the river, providin&apos; they did n&apos;t get too neighborly and
            settle down so close to him as to interfere with his plans. That range howl was pure
            bluff. I did n&apos;t even know he had any cattle at first. I think he was mad, too,
            because them Carrollses were gettin&apos; all that nice bottom land. He seemed
            possessed to keep people off &apos;n it. I reckon he thought he &apos;d get it
            sometime himself by some hook or crook. He was always callin&apos; the girl names
            because she was tryin&apos; to do a man&apos;s work. And then when she
            &apos;d got the evidence agin him about rustlin&apos; that there milch cow, I
            thought the man &apos;d lose his mind he was that mad. And then he began on me.
            Frank &apos;s a bad man, Tom. He &apos;s a devil. I wish I &apos;d never
            gone to work for him. He never let up on me. I &apos;m a foolish sort o&apos;
            feller, and I always want to do what anybody asks me to; it always seems as if that
            &apos;s what I want to do, too, what they want me to do, specially while I
            &apos;m talkin&apos; <pb n="299" id="VAA3895-297"/>to &apos;em. I
            don&apos;t seem to know how to get around it.&quot;</p>
          <p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
          <p>&quot;Come!&quot; said Tom, impatiently.</p>
          <p>The door was opened slightly and the jailer&apos;s head was thrust into the
            room.</p>
          <p>&quot;Hey, Tom! The old man&apos;s back and wants to know if you &apos;re
            goin&apos; to talk there all night? Ain&apos;t you most through?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Tell Dennison that we are almost through and that he need not
            worry,&quot; said Tom, briefly.</p>
          <p>&quot;You ain&apos;t afraid?&quot; asked the man facetiously.</p>
          <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Tom, more curtly than before.</p>
          <p>&quot;Shall I bring a light?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
          <p>The door banged shut.</p>
          <p>&quot;He said he&apos;d give me half the island and a team and wagon
            beside,&quot; went on Henry, wearily, &quot;if I &apos;d
            exterm&apos;nate the whole bunch. He said he&apos;d go up for sure, for cattle
            stealing, when the court came round--the girl had the evidence--and he wanted me to put
            plasters over their mouths before then, so &apos;s they could n&apos;t blab.
            When I asked him why he did n&apos;t do it himself, he said they &apos;d jump on
            him right away, but that no one would ever think o&apos; me. He said if they <pb
              n="300" id="VAA3895-298"/>did that, he had a stand-in with the sheriff and
            nothin&apos; would happen to me. He talked that stuff, day after day, till I
            promised--seemed as if I &apos;d go plumb mad if something did n&apos;t happen
            to stop his everlastin&apos; dingin&apos;. I was to do away with the girl
            first--he hated her so. I was to do it at the gulch. But--I could n&apos;t.
            Gosh-all-hemlocks! but he was mad when he came back from Westover and found I had
            n&apos;t done it. So at last I promised to go to the house and shoot &apos;em
            both. He went to Velpen that night so&apos;s he could prove an alibi or something
            like that, and just as it was gettin&apos; dusk I crossed over and crept up to the
            house and peeked in at the west window. There was the girl again with her yeller hair
            piled on top o&apos; her head and she had on a big blue apron--&quot; his voice
            faltered. &quot;Seems as if I can&apos;t never get away from seein&apos; her
            movin&apos; around so sweet and lovin&apos;-like. I could n&apos;t do it
            then. She sat down after a bit. Seemed as if she was goin&apos; to read the paper. I
            could n&apos;t see her no more then--she was too close to the wall, I guess. The kid
            was settin&apos; on the other side o&apos; the table, and I could see him all
            right--and the brother--I could see him plain--he was settin&apos; on the door step
            bathin&apos; his feet-- <pb n="301" id="VAA3895-299"/>and--and--oh, it was
            awful.&quot; He paused for breath. He was growing weak from the strain of his woful
            story.</p>
          <p>&quot;Tell me only the most important things to-night, Henry,&quot; said Tom,
            gently. &quot;Leave the rest for another time.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;It seemed as if I could n&apos;t do it,&quot; continued Henry,
            deliriously. &quot;I tried five times. One time he looked right at me, it seemed
            like, with his big tired eyes, brown like the girl&apos;s. I was five feet back and
            in the shadow, and I know he did n&apos;t see me, really, but I could n&apos;t
            any more have pulled the hammer with those eyes lookin&apos; toward me than I could
            have shot myself right that minute. Once a screech owl startled me--I thought at first
            it was a spirit. The other times, I just could n&apos;t do it. But at last I did. I
            shot true and straight right through the window, and he never said a word. He just fell
            over easy-like and lay still. I never killed nothin&apos; before,&quot; he said,
            pitifully, &quot;but just critters and coyotes. I ran around to the woodpile to see
            if I could n&apos;t muster up nerve enough to shoot the girl through the door, but
            when she came--I--could n&apos;t. I went back to the island and I guess I did
            n&apos;t know just what I was doin&apos;. I did n&apos;t strike the <pb
              n="302" id="VAA3895-300"/>road and went plungin&apos; along through the mud and
            water--there was back water from the rise--and finally I heard some shootin&apos;. I
            thought I was done for, but I got into the house all right. I could still hear the
            shootin&apos;, and, Tom, I heard that shootin&apos; all night long. I never went
            back--I stayed right there in the house, but I suppose she thought I was
            hangin&apos; round, and that plucky girl just kept shootin&apos; all night long,
            and it was so dark and it rained after a while, and she was all alone with just the kid.
            She never stopped till it got light. I got scared then to have Frank come back and find
            her still alive--he &apos;d have so much rather it had been her &apos;stead
            o&apos; him if only one was gone; so after a while I picked up my gun and started
            back, but then I saw you ridin&apos; like the devil, so I knew she must have sent
            the kid. I went back and changed my shoes--I could n&apos;t ride in those things,
            and I thought maybe I &apos;d have to bolt. When you came over to the island, I was
            hidin&apos; in the timber, and when I saw Josephine ridin&apos; off alone,
            I--took after her. I was afraid o&apos; what Frank would say when he came back. I
            was afraid he &apos;d kill me. But, Tom, I don&apos;t believe I &apos;d have
            done it,&quot; he continued. &quot;I don&apos;t believe I could <pb n="303"
              id="VAA3895-301"/>have brought myself to have done it, after all. I was n&apos;t
            trying to hit her when I shot.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I believe you, Henry,&quot; said Tom, with grave kindness. &quot;You
            are worn out. I will leave you now. But I will come again in the morning. Don&apos;t
            you worry. I always knew, Henry, that there was some one more to blame than you.
            Good-night.&quot;</p>
          <p>True to his word, he came again in the morning. He was bent upon obtaining release from
            his pledge of yesterday. It was a gigantic undertaking. Henry was possessed of a
            strange, unreasoning fear of his employer, coupled with a stubborn loyalty that held
            strongly to the opinion that treachery to an accessory was the meanest kind of meanness.
            But Tom persevered and finally, after much useless argument and persuasion, he said,
            very seriously, that Frank LaDue at large was a constant menace to the life and
            well-being of Josephine Carroll, and at the mention of her name Henry was as a child
            again. He gave his permission to act, readily, almost eagerly. Without this permission,
            Tom Burrington would have held the confidence as sacred as if sealed with the seal of
            the Roman Confessional. As he arose to depart, the intensity of relief de- <pb n="304"
              id="VAA3895-302"/>picted upon his face was so great that he seemed years younger and
            he strode to the door with much of the old spring in his step. When he reached the door,
            he heard his name called in a hesitating, apologetic sort of way and turned quickly,
            dreading a recall of the promise that insured him power to prosecute his hearty desire
            to put the arch-offender where he could no longer offend and where justice would be
            meted out to him as he had measured.</p>
          <p>&quot;Say, Tom,&quot; Henry was saying, confusedly, &quot;it ain&apos;t
            as if I was gettin&apos; off, myself, by givin&apos; him away. I
            couldn&apos;t do that. I know I&apos;m in for it. I ain&apos;t
            tryin&apos; to get off by turnin&apos; agin him. You know that, don&apos;t
            you? But I reckon the real reason for his not wantin&apos; any one round was because
            of the use he put that there island to. It will bear investigatin&apos;, for sure.
            And there &apos;s a dugout there, almost under the Carrolls&apos; noses, where
            you&apos;ll find the rest of your horses--if you &apos;re quick about it.
            You-all have been mighty slow. I should n&apos;t wonder if that young Injun buck,
            Bear Heart, the one who &apos;s after Rosebud, you know, had got ahead o&apos;
            you, after all. He &apos;s been on the trail for some time and she &apos;s been
            helpin&apos; him. Them Injuns ain&apos;t <pb n="305" id="VAA3895-303"/>got no
            use for Frank. You-all ain&apos;t been very smart, and that &apos;s a
            fact.&quot;</p>
          <p>Tom went directly to the State&apos;s Attorney; a complaint was filed and a warrant
            issued for the arrest of Frank LaDue, of LaDue Island, on the charge of murder.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XX</head>
          <head>THE END OF THE LONG CHASE</head>
          <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>HREE weeks later, toward the close of a long, warm afternoon in
            mid-summer, Tom Burrington was riding musingly homeward over the Seven-up trail. He had
            that day received a letter from Josephine Carroll in answer to a formal, business one of
            his own which he had written to her shortly after her departure. In it, he made brief
            mention of the temporary care he had assumed of the Broken Key stock and added that,
            subject to her approval, of course, he had so arranged it that they should graze with
            the Seven-up herds until such time as she should have made her plans for their ultimate
            disposal. He was also taking care of the White Slave, the boy whom Jack had befriended.
            &quot;Do not be too hard on the boy,&quot; he wrote. &quot;He is very young.
            He heard the shooting and hid in the woods all night. He was afraid to go home with the
            cows and afraid to go anywhere for fear of meeting some of the old gang whom he had
            turned against.&quot; He had pre- <pb n="307" id="VAA3895-305"/>sumed to act thus
            without her authority because she had left so hurriedly that there had been neither time
            nor opportunity to make definite provision for their welfare during her absence. What
            were her plans concerning the two claims? It would be well for her to come to some
            decision within a reasonable length of time or they might be jumped and her rights
            contested. They were considered desirable claims, and it was very probable that they
            would not be allowed to stand tenantless long unless she blocked any future trouble by
            conforming strictly to the letter of the law in regard to homesteads, the sooner, the
            better. As she doubtless knew, her brother had lived upon his quarter section a
            sufficient length of time to permit her, as sole heir, to commute and obtain a patent on
            his land without its in any way interfering with her own homestead rights. She could
            then, if she so desired, have a shanty erected and live upon her own claim. Meanwhile,
            he awaited her commands concerning her immediate business affairs and especially in
            respect of her concurrence or non-concurrence in the steps he had taken for the
            temporary relief of the Broken Key stock.</p>
          <p>It had been a cold letter, perhaps, under the <pb n="308" id="VAA3895-306"
            />circumstances, but he had so disliked to do what he had been compelled to do without
            her permission and under the ban of her displeasure. His pride had rebelled heartily,
            but he could not help himself. There was no one else to be responsible for the effects
            the dead boy had left, and Jack had been his friend, and--he loved her--Josephine. He
            loved her so much that nothing she could do or say now could dispossess that great love,
            though, of course, now, he could never tell her so. That time was past. The time had
            come when he was looking upon the canvas face to face, and she was not there. But he
            loved her, and because of that he had swallowed this much of his pride that he must
            suffer her probable misconstruction of his motives in order that when she was ready to
            take up again the burden of living that would be hard enough for her, poor Josephine,
            for a long weary while, she might find that she had not been altogether alone and that
            she might take up her burden without, at least, the handicap of the neglect or
            mismanagement of the material things of her life. After all, was she so much to blame
            for having thus taken her stand alone, accounting all against her because the plots
            formed in opposition to her and hers had been conceived in <pb n="309" id="VAA3895-307"
            />such utter darkness and mystery, and had arrived at their infamous growth in such
            profound secrecy, and yet withal had so pervaded the very atmosphere she breathed and
            had so hemmed her about on every side that she could have no power to discriminate and
            say: this man is and that man is not my friend? Was she so much to blame then? In his
            heart he knew that an unfriendly feeling toward the Carrolls as homesteaders had rankled
            in the breasts of many of his fellow cattle-men. He knew that this feeling of hostility,
            powerful because men of power held it, was catered to and promulgated by popular favor,
            and that it was this that had made it next to impossible for Jack to get native help to
            assist him in farming his land and thereby establishing a position with which the people
            were so thoroughly out of sympathy; but he also knew in his heart, that, though most of
            the cattlemen would have been honestly relieved and more than glad had young Carroll
            lost heart and found it advisable to relinquish his claim and try his fortune elsewhere,
            and even might not have been above assisting him to this wise conclusion in divers
            innocent ways, there was not one among them who would have dreamed of adopting the <pb
              n="310" id="VAA3895-308"/>extreme measure for ridding the country of his presence; and
            that they were few who were not inexpressibly shocked and indignant at the tragic
            outcome of their dissatisfaction. Not at the doors of the cattlemen could the terrible
            tragedy be laid; but could Josephine know this? Could she be brought to believe it?
            &quot;It has come to me that you knew something that you would not tell
            us,&quot; she had said. Was the suspicion unnatural in the light of circumstances?
            He had known that their coming was unwelcome to the majority of the ranchmen--but so had
            Jack, in the end. Could he have dreamed that Jack&apos;s life would be the price? He
            had known that pluck, endurance, tact, and a never flagging patience on the part of the
            young homesteader would finally win for him immunity and place, that no arbitrary means
            would be taken for his expulsion. Could he have dreamed of the miserable LaDue
            complication? Ah, but ought he not to have dreamed of it? Had he not heartily disliked
            the very thought of the man&apos;s nearness to her the first time he had ever seen
            Josephine? Had he ever respected LaDue or given him the credit for an atom of integrity?
            Thus he blamed himself harshly and he had been sore beset between his love, his wounded
              <pb n="311" id="VAA3895-309"/>pride, and his own feeling of personal blame when he had
            written that letter, coldly, perhaps. And she had answered thus: <text>

                  <p>I thank you for taking charge of the Broken Key stock and am sorry that my
                    thoughtlessness made it necessary for you to put yourself to so much trouble on
                    my account. Since you have been so good, however, I shall further tax your
                    generosity by asking you to continue your supervision until I have come to some
                    decision as to my future course. I shall try to decide soon, so that I may
                    relieve you of what, I am afraid, must be an unpleasant task--the caring for the
                    interests of a homesteader. Forgive me if I am harsh. Indeed, I am grateful. It
                    is only that I cannot see the light.</p>
                  <p>You ask me if I intend to go back. I will let you know as soon as I know
                    myself. I do not think, however, that I shall ever go back. I cannot bear to
                    think of it--and I am afraid. My brother&apos;s murderer is still at large.
                    The interests of the cattlemen are seemingly in direct opposition to such a step
                    on my part. I have no friends to help me. I am alone, and I am a woman, and I am
                    not strong enough to fight it out. If my brother were here, I should never give
                    up--never--to the arrogance that would deny me my right; but he is gone, and so
                    what is the use? Like him, I am very tired and it is not worth while.</p>
                  <p>In a few days at most I hope to be able to <pb n="312" id="VAA3895-310"/>give
                    you instructions as to the disposal of my stock. My uncle joins me in thanking

          <p>Cold, too, this letter of Josephine&apos;s, and still doubtful of him; but was she
            so much to blame? As she had said, &quot;I cannot see the light.&quot; Ah, well,
            what she thought could make no difference as to his part in life henceforth. That part
            was to bring under the noose of the law Jack&apos;s murderer, who was still, as
            Josephine had said, at large. This thing he would do if it took him until his
            life&apos;s end; for Jack&apos;s sake, for Josephine&apos;s sake, for his
            own sake, for the honor of the cattle country. So he threw up the head that the coldness
            of Josephine&apos;s letter had bowed in sadness and rode on.</p>
          <p>He had dwelt incessantly ever since it had been discovered that Frank LaDue was not at
            home on the island, and, furthermore, that painstaking search had failed to disclose his
            present whereabouts, upon that chance remark of Henry Hoffman&apos;s, that Frank
            LaDue had boasted of a &quot;stand-in&quot; with Sheriff Dennison, and he won-
              <pb n="313" id="VAA3895-311"/>dered if it could be true. The thought had chafed him
            unutterably.</p>
          <p>There was a new man at the ferry. The boat had been found several days after the
            tragedy some distance below Ole Johnson&apos;s place, drawn up securely into the
            slack water of an indentation that cut into the sandy drift below the chalk-rock bluffs.
            With what object in view the owner of it had made so unusual a landing, one that smacked
            so strongly of a desire for concealment, was not easy of divination, especially when one
            took into consideration the idea conveyed by Henry Hoffman&apos;s assertion that
            LaDue rather courted publicity than otherwise for his movements immediately antedating
            and during the night of the shocking tragedy. But the boat was there, and however
            awkward and inadequate its service, there was an urgent need of it on the old trail, and
            the patrons of the road were agreed that it must be returned to its accustomed quarters.
            It was a ticklish undertaking thus to tamper with the effects of a vindictive outlaw,
            but there was no hesitation and but little precaution in the performance of it. As Ole
            Johnson said with a fine unconcern:</p>

          <p>&quot;Let him shoot and be damned, the skunk, and we &apos;ll ferret him out by
            the smell of his powder,&quot; and the rest had ratified the defiance with hearty
            unanimity.</p>
          <p>So the boat was rowed laboriously back against the high-water current and lodged again
            at its old moorings, where another surprise awaited the neighbors, who had thought they
            knew the big, fair, reticent, self-centred Norseman, for he volunteered good-naturedly
            to be within hail on certain days of the week to assist the crossing of the ranchmen who
            lived on the other side. He was waiting for Burrington now, leaning contentedly against
            the bank and chewing tobacco with a serene indifference to any possible danger that
            might be lurking for him anywhere about because of his cavalier handling of another
            man&apos;s goods.</p>
          <p>&quot;Nothing doing, I suppose, Ole?&quot; asked Tom, lightly, as he mounted
            his horse after their slow and wearisome crossing.</p>
          <p>&quot;There is nothing doing, no,&quot; acquiesced the Norseman.</p>
          <p>&quot;Nevertheless, Ole, I think you had better keep a pretty sharp
            lookout,&quot; advised Burrington, seriously. &quot;He has an ugly disposition
            and <pb n="315" id="VAA3895-313"/>would doubtless find a real sport in potting both you
            and that tub full of holes in mid-stream if the notion struck him.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You think he is about this place?&quot; inquired Ole, with phlegmatic
            unconcern, as he prepared to make himself comfortable under a shady elm. The water had
            long since crept up to the timber line so that he had not far to go.</p>
          <p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; said Tom, gloomily. &quot;Where is he then? Are
            n&apos;t you going back to-night, Ole? It is late.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I&apos;ll wait a bit. Them Injuns are somewhere on the island--Bear Heart
            and that half-breed girl of Two Hawks. They seem to be hanging round most of the time.
            The girl told me to wait a little while.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Funny,&quot; thought Tom. &quot;I wonder why Rosebud is going back
            to-night.&quot;</p>
          <p>The sun was very low when Tom rode slowly past the little log house whimsically called
            the Broken Key. The day had been insufferably hot. Even yet the heat radiated in warm
            waves from the generous earth which would continue to give of its fulness long after the
            sun had gone down. But it was not like the glare of the zenith-riding sun of mid-day.
            Tom took off his heavy hat to <pb n="316" id="VAA3895-314"/>cool his moist, red-creased
            forehead and flicked it thoughtfully back and forth before his heated face. How deserted
            it all looked! Deserted and forlorn! The weeds had grown so rankly around the woodpile
            in the three weeks as almost to hide its weather-stained grayness and lonesome look of
            disuse, and the path leading to it was well-nigh obliterated by the crowding phalanx.
            The encroachment unexpectedly stopped short at the rude lattice where Josephine had
            planted her sweet peas and which, instead of having been choked out of existence, had
            already begun to blossom. Tom did not wonder how the flowers received water and
            attention. He took their presence altogether for granted in the masculine way that
            evinces no curiosity until the wonted has been suddenly blotted from his vision; but he
            did wish that Josephine might have been there to see this fructification of her
            undismayed effort on the untried soil. And then upon his brooding spirit fell a strange,
            new depression fraught with vague forebodings of evil to come and a man&apos;s grief
            for the empty house that had sheltered for a little while within its rough exterior a
            bit of fair life now passed from it forever. The blinds were drawn at the closed
            windows, shutting out <pb n="317" id="VAA3895-315"/>the heartless day from view of the
            dead ashes of the hearthstone. Nothing could ever make it the same any more. There was
            no sign of life anywhere while the evening deepened and the windows shone with a ghostly
            reflection as the sun sank at last behind the hills, and when Tom rode away from the
            reverie-haunted melancholy that must abide there forever, his eyes were wet because of
            many things, but principally because of the inevitable sadness of the brief play of the
            Broken Key, played too soon and ended so irrevocably.</p>
          <p>About a mile beyond, he met Rosebud. The girl arose spectrally from a clump of plum
            trees bordering a ravine by the roadside and advanced to meet him.</p>
          <p>&quot;You are to go back at once,&quot; she said, abruptly. She carried a gun
            and looked brave and determined.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Tom, in astonishment.</p>
          <p>&quot;You are not to ask why. Won&apos;t you take my word for it and go back to
            Velpen at once?&quot; she asked, hurriedly. &quot;You can trust
            Onjijitka.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I have n&apos;t a doubt in the world as to that, Rosebud,&quot; said
            Tom, heartily, &quot;but you might as well understand right now that I shall not
            stir <pb n="318" id="VAA3895-316"/>one step until you have satisfied my
            curiosity.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Ole Johnson is still at the landing,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I told
            him to wait. He thinks I am going back, but I was thinking of you when I told him to
            wait. If you hurry, you will find him there, and he will take you across.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Come, Rosebud, tell me what it is all about,&quot; demanded Tom,
            peremptorily. &quot;You have news of LaDue, have you not? For God&apos;s sake,
            don&apos;t waste time. What is it?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;If you would only go--for Josephine&apos;s sake,&quot; insisted
            Rosebud, forlornly, knowing that she was beaten, but clinging desperately to her
            overwhelming desire that he should turn back.</p>
          <p>&quot;I can better stay--for Josephine&apos;s sake,&quot; said Tom,
            gravely, as he dismounted. &quot;If you convince me that I do right to retrace my
            steps, why, I will surely do so. Is n&apos;t that fair, Rosebud? I shall not stir
            until I know what it is all about.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You--you--men are all so stubborn,&quot; said Rosebud, with angry scorn.
            &quot;You will never listen to reason. It is the same way with Bear Heart. He could
            have given LaDue up more times than once, but no--he must be forever trailing him to
            find out about the Indian cattle <pb n="319" id="VAA3895-317"/>he stole. He says he will
            kill him himself when he finds out about them. Foolish Bear Heart! What does that matter
            since those calves are scattered all over the world by this time and he never will get
            them back? But Two Hawks is getting old, and he listens to the young Bear Heart, and so
            what can Onjijitka do?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You can tell me, Rosebud,&quot; prompted Tom, with gleaming eyes. He had
            struck the long-sought trail at last.</p>
          <p>&quot;Tom,&quot; she began, her present impetuosity in striking contrast to her
            former air of reluctance, &quot;Bear Heart heard Frank LaDue boast last night that
            he was going to waylay you to-day on the road from Velpen. He said that you were the
            cause of all his trouble, and that if it were not for you Dennison would not dream of
            arresting him. He said that it was none of your business, and that he intended to put a
            plaster over your mouth this very day, to pay you for your interference. So I am here to
            tell you and to beg you to go back before it is too late. He was to go to the island
            between seven and eight o&apos;clock and to wait for you there, but you are earlier
            than he planned for. He will be coming along soon now. Do go! How can you
            hesitate?&quot;</p>
          <pb n="320" id="VAA3895-318"/>
          <p>&quot;Rosebud,&quot; asked Tom, irrelevantly, &quot;where did Bear Heart
            see LaDue?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;That is Bear Heart&apos;s secret,&quot; said Rosebud, steadily.
            &quot;But I have his permission to tell you that he has at last found the dugout,
            and that your horses are still there and have been well cared for. So you see LaDue
            still has friends, even though you have sent three of the gang to the penitentiary. I am
            also to tell you that Bear Heart will drive your horses home to-night. What you have
            asked is, as I have said, Bear Heart&apos;s secret.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Maybe you are right,&quot; said Tom, with intense disappointment, and
            giving little heed to the news of the discovered dugout. He had long thought that Frank
            LaDue was only a common horse thief and cattle rustler, and the absolute proof of it
            interested him but little now. His mind was bent on something graver than thieving. So
            had it been bent when he rode to Westover, outwardly seeking his own stolen property--in
            reality trailing the man who, he believed, meant no good to Josephine Carroll.
            &quot;I am afraid, though, that it looks bad for Bear Heart. Tell him that it looks
            mightily like complicity to me and will look so to others, and that it might <pb n="321"
              id="VAA3895-319"/>go hard with him if his unlawful knowledge is found out on him. I
            should be sorry. I always thought he was a good Indian.&quot;</p>
          <p>Up went the girl&apos;s proud head and her dark eyes flashed defiance.
            &quot;Bear Heart is a true son of the Dakotahs,&quot; she said, haughtily.
            &quot;It is only when we marry with the white men that our young men
            steal.&quot;</p>
          <p>It was a scathing rebuke, and it went home, for with his fair mind and unprejudiced
            judgment, Tom knew that much of what she said was true.</p>
          <p>&quot;Forgive me, Rosebud,&quot; he said, simply. &quot;I was
            wrong.&quot;</p>
          <p>He vaulted into his saddle.</p>
          <p>&quot;You are going back?&quot; she implored, hopefully.</p>
          <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Tom, with great deliberation, &quot;I am going forward
            to meet my friend LaDue.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I hoped,&quot; said Rosebud, despairingly, &quot;that he would pass
            first. I was ready for him. I was going to kill him. He is a desperate man. He is also a
            coward. He will not meet you in the road like a man. He will lie in hiding by the way
            and shoot you in the back. I had to plan that way--to hide in ambush but that is because
            I am a <pb n="322" id="VAA3895-320"/>girl and a Dakotah, and he is a big strong man and
            would kill me as he would a snake before I could even know what he was about. So I hid.
            And he will hide. Tom, you must listen to me!&quot; she cried, passionately.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, my girl,&quot; said Tom, laughingly, &quot;what would Bear Heart
            think if he knew that you were planning cold-bloodedly to put out of existence this man
            whom he considers his own just prey? Did you really mean to do it? Bear Heart will never
            forgive you, notwithstanding that his heart is set upon you.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I could not help that.&quot; There was much dignity in the simple
            rejoinder.</p>
          <p>&quot;But we are wasting too much time,&quot; exclaimed Tom, suddenly.
            &quot;It is getting late. You must go home, Rosebud. I have taken command of this
            affair, and I bid you go home, and go at once. I shall ride on and meet our
            man--provided his words were not a vain boast, as I am much inclined to believe they
            were. You need not be afraid that he will waylay me. He has too much to answer for
            already. Besides, he does not dare to touch Tom Burrington of the
            Seven-up.&quot;</p>
          <p>He smiled, deprecating his own self-esteem.</p>
          <pb n="323" id="VAA3895-321"/>
          <p>&quot;Promise me that you will go home, Rosebud,&quot; he said.</p>
          <p>&quot;I will go,&quot; she said, soberly.</p>
          <p>He started forward, but came back before he had gone far.</p>
          <p>&quot;You said you would go home, did n&apos;t you?&quot; he asked,
            doubtfully.</p>
          <p>&quot;I said I would go,&quot; she responded, enigmatically.</p>
          <p>He started again, stopped, and turned around in his saddle.</p>
          <p>&quot;I have your promise?&quot; he called, confidently.</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, and he rode away.</p>
          <p>Rosebud stood still in the road and watched him as he cantered up a little knoll and
            disappeared behind its yonder slope. Then she smiled--a ghost of a vanishing smile.</p>
          <p>&quot;He killed Jack,&quot; she said to herself, whisperingly, and with the
            rifle held firmly in her arms, she returned to the roadside, slipped down into her old
            position among the plum trees and resumed her vigil.</p>
          <p>Tom had gone but a short distance when, turning a sharp bend where the trail swerved in
            order to take advantage of a capacious &quot;draw,&quot; he was suddenly
            .confronted by the outlaw, Frank <pb n="324" id="VAA3895-322"/>LaDue, with a revolver
            handily in play, who seemed to have been awaiting his nearer approach.</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, it &apos;s you, is it, Frank?&quot; said Tom, pleasantly.</p>
          <p>&quot;You are right there, pard, it&apos;s me,&quot; said LaDue,
            significantly.</p>
          <p>&quot;You have been causing your friends some uneasiness by your long-continued
            absence,&quot; said Tom, smilingly, but with a watchful eye.</p>
          <p>&quot;Specially you, I presume?&quot; asked LaDue, with an impious grin.</p>
          <p>&quot;Especially me,&quot; acquiesced Tom, imperturbably.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, here I am,&quot; boasted LaDue, grandiloquently. &quot;Now,
            what are you goin&apos; to do about it? You don&apos;t seem to be
            makin&apos; no great shakes o&apos; palaverin&apos; over the prodigal-
            weepin&apos; on my neck and killin&apos; the fatted calf. Maybe I &apos;m
            dull, but I sure don&apos;t read the signs that way.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;If I had read--some signs as easily as you read these, Frank, one who is gone
            might even now be here in my place before you to teach a dastardly coward how to fight
            fair.&quot; Tom&apos;s voice vibrated with passionate scorn.</p>
          <p>&quot; Look a-here, Tom Burrington, I don&apos;t stand for no more
            callin&apos; names. D &apos;ye understand? <pb n="325" id="VAA3895-323"
            />You&apos;ve trailed me long enough and I&apos;ve turned. This ain&apos;t
            been none o&apos; your business from the start, but you insisted on gettin&apos;
            into the round-up without permit, so now you&apos;ll have to stand for your share of
            the shift. Nobody asked for your interference, damn you, Burrington! What is it to
            you--what has it ever been to you, I &apos;d like to know--a private quarrel I had
            with my own enemy? Do you think you &apos;re God A&apos;mighty that you must
            have a hand in workin&apos; over the ethics o&apos; this here cattle country?
            Well, you ain&apos;t. If it had n&apos;t been for you and your
            everlastin&apos; bigotry, I would n&apos;t be sneakin&apos; round the outer
            edges o&apos; civilization now and eatin&apos; snakes and toads, for all it
            &apos;d matter to you. Fortunately my diet does n&apos;t depend upon you or your
            movements. I have a friend or two yet who &apos;ll stick to me long after the
            coyotes are pickin&apos; your bones--for I am goin&apos; to kill you, Tom
            Burrington, I &apos;m goin&apos; to shoot you just as I &apos;d shoot a
            pesky rattler that disputed my right o&apos; way. No, don&apos;t move your hand
            that way, damn you, Tom. You ain&apos;t got no more use for a gun than a poor little
            homesick doggie has. Yes, I killed Carroll, I ain&apos;t any call to lie about
            it--&apos;specially to you. I &apos;m glad I killed him. I &apos;d do it
            again <pb n="326" id="VAA3895-324"/>if I could. I only wish I &apos;d done it
            sooner. I wish I &apos;d killed him the night o&apos; the blizzard like I
            started out to do. You &apos;d found him with a bullet through his head if I
            &apos;d only been sure o&apos; finding him in the storm. And I wish
            you&apos;d a&apos; been killed outright when your saddle broke at the
            ropin&apos;. I only planned your defeat because you were gettin&apos; a little
            too high-headed for your own good, so to speak, and thought you were big enough to carry
            those land-grabbers on your own shoulders; but it &apos;d a&apos; saved a heap
            o&apos; trouble since if you &apos;d never got your breath again. You
            &apos;ve been so smart ever since that you thought you could overturn and
            reconstruct the whole moral plan o&apos; the cow lands. But you can&apos;t.
            It&apos;s a bigger proposition than tyin&apos; a steer with the women
            lookin&apos; on and clappin&apos; their fool hands. This ain&apos;t a
            woman&apos;s country, my friend. You&apos;ve got to go it alone. I have only one
            regret. As I said, this ain&apos;t no woman&apos;s country. If I &apos;d
            only killed that miserable girl before she got away, I would n&apos;t ask for
            anything more. I tried to--it ain&apos;t my fault that I did
            n&apos;t--hell!&quot;</p>
          <p>This exclamation was called forth by Tom&apos;s unexpected move. Maddened to
            desperation by this last, this venomous attack upon Josephine, <pb n="327"
              id="VAA3895-325"/>he had suddenly dodged down behind his horse&apos;s head and
            slipped from the saddle, dragging his revolver from its holster during his sliding
            transit to the ground. Almost simultaneously with his violent outcry, LaDue fired, but
            he was disconcerted by the unexpectedness of Tom&apos;s action and missed. Before he
            could fire a second time, Tom&apos;s arm shot out in front of his horse, and the
            young ranchman dealt death fairly and truly to the slayer of his friend so that he fell
            from his saddle without a word and lay in a still bunch upon the road, his boots
            trailing in the dust of the vanishing cattle trails.</p>
          <p>&quot;It had to be,&quot; whispered Tom, his face set in lines of great and
            stern sadness. &quot;It was his life or mine.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;It is well,&quot; said a soft, even voice at his elbow. &quot;I
            should have done it, but it is well. I told you that he had murder in his
            heart.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Rosebud! I thought you had gone home!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I am going now,&quot; she said, and glided away straight into the heart
            of the trackless and darkening wilderness.</p>

          <p><hi rend="b">T</hi>HERE were two things in the letter Rosebud wrote soon after this
            that arrested Josephine&apos;s aimless drifting along in the present and called her

          <p>&quot;And now that Frank LaDue is dead, Henry Hoffman safe for probably a twenty
            years&apos; imprisonment, and the island no longer a runway for stolen cattle,

            to light and have made it impossible that any future unlawful proceedings find a
            friendly cover there, there is peace along the river, and decent people can walk out in
            daylight once more without being in dread of what may be lurking behind every tree in
            the valley that surrounds them or every turn in the road that lies before them.
            Ruffianism is dead in Kemah, Josephine. It died with the arch-fiend, Frank
            LaDue.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="329" id="VAA3895-327"/>
          <p>This word from Rosebud caused all fear for her own life, should she ever again listen
            to the lure of the West, to fall away from her, and the lifting of the blanket horror
            was an unspeakable relief to her, even though she might never return to take advantage
            of the freer air that would grant her life without hampering and dread conditions. It
            was a good word. Rosebud went on:</p>
          <p>&quot;He made a cloak, Josephine, of the unfriendly feeling in the cattle lands
            toward homesteading, entertained by the stock-raisers in general, and which even
            amounted to bitter animosity in some quarters, but he was not in league with them at
            all. They would not stoop to make a tool of such a brutal and treacherous villain as
            Frank LaDue; but he assumed the cloak of their resentment to hide his baser designs in
            running you out of the country, and I think he trusted too much in the strength of this
            resentment, Josephine. I think that he thought it was so great and so bitter as to
            condone his fault and to win for him exemption from prosecution, even if his guilt was
            discovered; especially, since he had relieved them of all trouble and had spared them
            blood-guiltiness. But he miscalculated and was led far astray. There was even talk of
            lynch law, Jo- <pb n="330" id="VAA3895-328"/>sephine. The stockmen had absolutely
            nothing to do with Jack&apos;s murder.&quot;</p>
          <p>But it was what followed in Rosebud&apos;s letter that roused her fighting Southern
            spirit from its lethargy and sent her to repacking her trunks in the old purposeful
            way:</p>
          <p>&quot;It is true, however, that they were opposed to your settling west of the
            river. By what right were they so insolently opposed? But they were and are. Yet it is a
            free country, and there is room for all. They make of themselves an allied band for
            present gain and selfish personal aggrandizement and rule by force and arrogance. It is
            as lawless in principle as when lesser men band together to steal horses or cattle. If
            you will come back, Josephine, I will gladly come to you as I promised, and we, you and
            I, just two girls, will fight it out together. Your land is too fair to loose, too rich
            in promise, and to stay away--that is just what they want you to do, with the exception,
            perhaps, of Tom Burrington of the Seven-up. We will force these insolent men to
            acknowledge the justness of our position and wrest our right from the greed that would
            withhold it.&quot;</p>
          <p>The Indian girl had touched the right chord. <pb n="331" id="VAA3895-329"/>Gone forever
            were the dreamy dwelling in the past, the indecision of the present, and the shrinking
            dread of the future. It was living again to feel the blood of a fighting ancestry
            pounding through her veins once more. Jack had died for a principle. He had vindicated
            it with his blood. Should it count for naught? Should she let the land for which he had
            given his life slip away from her control because she, the last of the Carrolls, lacked
            the courage and resolution, the high faith and lofty pride to uphold the standard of
            right against might which had fallen from Jack&apos;s hands only when he had bought
            its immortality with his life&apos;s blood? Must the red-stained banner be let to
            trail in the dust of cowardice and inaction for want of a consecrated standard-bearer,
            or left for others to bear it again into the heart of the contemptuous and overbearing
            cattle lands? No, no! Not when it was Jack who had been the sacrifice. She could and
            would rise to the greatness of the trust. She not only should keep his land from
            slipping back into the general description of unoccupied government lands and thereby
            hold it beyond the reach of hovering land hawks, but she should also snatch her own
            claim from their talons. These two things she should <pb n="332" id="VAA3895-330"/>do if
            her own life paid the price. She hated herself for her former shrinking, cowardly
            inaction, and indecision. In August, the six months of grace given her before she must
            go to live upon her own claim would be expired. It was high time she was about the
            business of having her house built and preparations under way for the care and comfort
            during the long siege of the coming Winter of her stock, of herself, and of Rosebud. So
            she wrote to Rosebud without the loss of a day and asked her to open the Broken Key and
            to meet her at Velpen upon a certain day in August with Long Chase. She also wrote a
            brief note to Tom Burrington, thanking him again for his kindly forethought and care,
            and asking him to return the Broken Key stock by a certain day in August, on which date
            Rosebud would take up her residence at the Broken Key in readiness for her,
            Josephine&apos;s return. These two letters written and despatched, Josephine went
            quietly about the task of packing her trunks for her second flitting.</p>
          <p>It was on a cool, sunny, bracing day in early August that Ole Johnson, with neighborly
            accommodation and with infinite patience and labor, crossed the river with his wagon and
            heavy team <pb n="333" id="VAA3895-331"/>to move the household effects from the log
            cabin of the Broken Key to the tiny frame shanty that had suddenly sprung into existence
            on the quarter north. The loaded wagon was creaking and swaying along the level grassy
            way at the foot of the hills, with the big blonde Norwegian trudging by the side, when
            Louis Burrington, on horseback, cantered up to the door of the dismantled cabin and
            emitted a &quot;Hello, the house!&quot; with much strength of youthful lungs and
            a resultant joyous shrillness of intonation. It was not his first visit by any means,
            not understanding, and therefore wisely not accepting, the new status of strained
            civility between the once so familiar houses of the Seven-up and the Broken Key.</p>
          <p>Josephine came to the door with a broom in her hand and with her pretty hair tucked
            into a dust cap.</p>
          <p>&quot;We are too busy for a social chat, chum,&quot; she said, smiling a
            welcome, &quot;but &apos;light and come in and oversee this tremendous affair of
            moving, won&apos;t you? By and by, you may saddle and bridle Long Chase for me and
            escort Rosebud and me to our new domicile, and I will make you a cup of tea and you will
            be the first guest <pb n="334" id="VAA3895-332"/>to receive hospitality dispensed from
            the new abode. Will you like that?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Good for you, Josephine,&quot; cried the boy, jumping from his horse and
            accepting her further invitation with alacrity. He followed her to the house and would
            have sat down upon the door step but, bethinking himself, flushed hotly and choked up,
            while tears swam in his blue eyes. He sat down on an empty box, hurriedly. Josephine,
            too, shuddered a little, but she said very gently:</p>
          <p>&quot;Never mind, honey, we won&apos;t think of it any more, you and I. Tell
            me, what have you been doing since I saw you last?&quot;</p>
          <p>Rosebud, who would not leave Josephine alone on this last day, now took advantage of
            the boy&apos;s presence to strike across the country on the trail of the slowly
            moving wagon, so that she might be on hand to help with the unloading and perhaps be in
            time to give the house a little home touch here and there before Josephine came. Two
            Hawks had put forth no objection to his step-daughter&apos;s change of residence. He
            was fond of her in his lazy, uninitiative way, but she tried him sorely because of her
            pride and her strange unrest. He was therefore frankly re- <pb n="335" id="VAA3895-333"
            />lieved and enjoyed to the uttermost the respite from the discontent and the unflagging
            persuasions to a cleaner, more ambitious life with which, in truth, he had been beset
            since the day he had married the mother of this strange, dreamy, passionate creature;
            but if she had troubled his easy and phlegmatic nature in those earlier days, he counted
            it as of little worth as compared with the later time when these young and untried
            gentlefolks had come out of the South to let loose the devil of reform in his tepee. So
            Two Hawks was weakly glad. As for Bear Heart, Bear Heart of the unconquerable soul, his
            man hunt ended, he went back to the wide plains, drew his Blanket about him, and bided
            his time.</p>
          <p>&quot;It would have been a lot easier for you to have gotten a wagon from the
            Seven-up than for Ole Johnson to have to cross his on that clumsy boat,&quot; said
            Louis, judicially.</p>
          <p>&quot;You are right,&quot; replied Josephine, laying aside her dust cap and
            ruffling up her bright hair with her hands.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why did n&apos;t you?&quot; demanded Louis, discontentedly.</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, because Mr. Johnson is my nearest neighbor and he was good enough to
            offer his services,&quot; <pb n="336" id="VAA3895-334"/>explained Josephine,
            tranquilly. &quot;Had n&apos;t you better go for my horse now?&quot;</p>
          <p>But Louis did not know that he was treading upon dangerous ground and blurted out in
            surprise:</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, you are not half ready, Josephine! You can&apos;t ride in those
            calico duds, you know. I &apos;ll have Long Chase here in a jiffy when you are ready
            to lock up. Tom &apos;d have offered his services quick enough, too, only I
            think--mind, it&apos;s only a think, Josephine--but I think that Tom thinks you
            &apos;re mad at him. He never said anything,&quot; continued the boy, loyally,
            &quot;I just think. Gee! If our friend Ole had had to depend on the boat Tom had
            when he went after Ole&apos;s fast horse, I guess he would n&apos;t be so flush
            scattering favors around so free and easy,&quot; he ended, grumblingly.</p>
          <p>&quot;What boat are you talking about?&quot; demanded Josephine, stopping short
            on her way to change the &quot;calico duds&quot; to which the boy had put forth
            such lofty objection. &quot;What kind of a boat did your brother use?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;A leaky old tub so full of holes that it sank when Tom got to the middle of
            the river,&quot; explained Louis, with unction.</p>
          <pb n="337" id="VAA3895-335"/>
          <p>&quot;What did he do then?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Swam, of course. Did n&apos;t Rosebud tell you about it? Come to think of
            it, though, I guess she did n&apos;t know, herself, what a time Tom had. She helped
            him find the boat, but she &apos;d gone back when Tom&apos;s troubles began.
            Gee! Tom&apos;s a strong swimmer! I &apos;ll bet anybody but him &apos;d
            have drowned two or three times over before he got across. But, gee! That was easy
            compared with what came after!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, what did come after?&quot; demanded Josephine, with some
            impatience.</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, the current was so strong, he just drifted and drifted down the river,
            and when he finally did manage to get across--what do you suppose?&quot; He paused,
            impressively. &quot;Well, sir, he had gone past the Gap, and there was n&apos;t
            any place to crawl out at, &apos;cause there were just bare bluffs that stuck right
            down into the water. Now what do you think of that? So he just let himself float along
            till he came to Ole&apos;s. But he scratched his hands all up till they bled a
            lot--trying to get out, I guess. Gee! He was a sight when he came after
            mother.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;That is why he was barefoot, I suppose,&quot; she said, musingly.
            &quot;I wondered about it afterward.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="338" id="VAA3895-336"/>
          <p>&quot;You see, he said he kicked off his shoes before ever he got into the boat
            &apos;cause he knew he &apos;d have to swim for it sooner or later. I wish I was
            as brave as Tom,&quot; he added, ingenuously.</p>
          <p>&quot;I think that it was very foolhardy of him to take such a serious risk,
            knowing as he did, that his boat was absolutely untrustworthy,&quot; said Josephine,
            gravely.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, it was for you, you know,&quot; argued Louis. &quot;I
            can&apos;t much blame him, I must say. A fellow &apos;d be a chump who would
            n&apos;t do a lot more than that for you, Josephine,&quot; he said,
            affectionately.</p>
          <p>&quot;Thank you, dear boy,&quot; said Josephine, quietly, and slipped into the
            inner room. Was the whole world in a conspiracy to force her to believe that Tom had
            been true? First there was Rosebud, drawing a strict line, and unwaveringly adhering to
            it, between the desire of the stock-raisers and the deed of the ruffian, LaDue. If it
            was true that Jack&apos;s murder had been without the consent, the knowledge, or
            even the acquiescence of the cattlemen, then had she indeed mis-judged her
            brother&apos;s friend, and the attitude of accuser that she had assumed toward him
            could have no justification in what had seemed like <pb n="339" id="VAA3895-337"/>the
            working out of the will of the master mind by the hand of an inferior. If, as Rosebud
            believed, LaDue had not even the excuse of doing as he had done with the fanatical idea
            that he was acting with the tacit consent of the ranchmen, but had made use of their
            disaffection as a cloak to hide his own infamy, hoping then to curry favor with which to
            ward off prosecution, then, indeed, how could her brother&apos;s friend have
            foreseen the terrible tragedy? There was Rosebud, too, with a few telling words, making
            the inestimable part Tom had played in obtaining Henry&apos;s confession and his
            incomparable heroism in going forth to meet and arrest, alone, a desperate outlaw at
            bay, afterwards slain in self-defence, stand out in the light of their real greatness.
            And now here was Louis, in his innocent prattle, telling of yet other great things that
            had been done for her by a cattleman, for her who was a homesteader. Had her quick
            woman&apos;s suspicion been ignoble, after all? When, dressed for riding, she
            returned to the boy, she asked straightforwardly:</p>
          <p>&quot;Why did not Mr. Burrington tell me about these things, Louis?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Men don&apos;t brag, Josephine,&quot; replied Louis, airily.
            &quot;Just the same,&quot; he added, plaintively, <pb n="340" id="VAA3895-338"
            />&quot;I do wish I had n&apos;t promised not to tell you about the gulch. My
            telling would n&apos;t so much matter. I &apos;m not a man--yet. But
            Tom&apos;s so squeamish about some things. However, I promised, and so you need
            n&apos;t ask me to tell because I am not going to. Are you all ready,
            Josephine?&quot;</p>
          <p>It was late Fall before she saw Tom Burrington. He came riding over to the new
            homestead one still day in November when the haze of Indian Summer rested lightly and
            dreamily over the gaunt outlines of stripped wood and hill and plain.</p>
          <p>&quot;I could n&apos;t bear it any longer,&quot; he told her, gravely, as
            his big figure crossed the threshold of the tiny house where she and Rosebud were so
            intrepidly working out the details of their resolution. Unlike the cabin of the Broken
            Key, this house was built away from the timbered district, up on the grass lands just
            under the hills, and commanded a far outlook down the valley. Josephine had a dread of
            the woods of late, and so had builded in the open.</p>
          <p>&quot;Rosebud is out with the cattle,&quot; said Josephine, nervously.
            &quot;She will be sorry to miss you.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I did not come to see Rosebud. I came to <pb n="341" id="VAA3895-339"/>see
            you, Josephine,&quot; said Tom, unequivocally. He would not sit down, but stood
            straight and determined before her.</p>
          <p>&quot;Before you say anything,&quot; began Josephine, earnestly, &quot;I
            want to ask you something. You must tell me the truth this time, Mr. Burrington. Nothing
            but the truth will count now. You did not shoot at a wolf that time--in the gulch. Tell
            me, what did you shoot at?&quot; She lifted her great, serious, brown eyes to him,
            questioningly.</p>
          <p>&quot;I shot at a man, Josephine,&quot; he responded, simply.</p>
          <p>Josephine began to tremble violently, uncontrollably. She had grown very pale. She
            had been trying hard to prepare herself for this revelation ever since Louis&apos;
            innocent half-betrayal on that day when he had ridden over to help her and Rosebud move;
            but this indisputable proving of the brutal truth found and left her for the moment
            completely unnerved. She had been so light-hearted that evening riding down into the
            gulch. And now to think what had lurked for her in that shadowed little washout up on
            the western wall! She had been so unconscious of any hostile presence, and new to think
            what might have been! She shivered again and again.</p>
          <pb n="342" id="VAA3895-340"/>
          <p>&quot;Who was the man?&quot; she asked, tremulously.</p>
          <p>&quot;Henry Hoffman.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Did you know him?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Not then. I found out for sure afterwards. Who told you,
            Josephine?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Never mind that now. No one told me. I have been thinking, that is all. And
            you think he was going to kill me?&quot; she asked with an effort, though she was
            fast regaining self-control.</p>
          <p>&quot;I thought so--yes. He told me afterwards, in his confession, that he never
            could have done it. Sometimes, I believe that he spoke the truth, Josephine, and that he
            never could have done it.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Did Jack know?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Yes, I told him. He did not believe it.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Then you did not keep anything back from my brother--he knew
            everything?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I think he knew everything that I knew.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;And yet he stayed?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;And yet he stayed.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I wish you had told me, Mr. Burrington,&quot; said Josephine, wistfully.
            &quot;If you had told me, Jack might be here to-day,&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;It was so horrible, Josephine,&quot; he said, &quot;and we could not
            be sure. It was Jack&apos;s wish as well as mine that you be not told.&quot;</p>
          <pb n="343" id="VAA3895-341"/>
          <p>Never again was this subject of what might have been mentioned between these two. Many
            things might have been different had they foreseen or had they had a better
            understanding then of some signs that were so easy to read--afterwards; but they had not
            foreseen and they had not understood, so they tried to forget.</p>
          <p>She held out her hand. &quot;Will you forgive me?&quot; she asked, simply.
            &quot;I was altogether wrong. Let us be friends again.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why, Josephine,&quot; he stammered, his face flushing, suddenly,
            &quot;why, Josephine, I--I--forgive you? Why, I love you. Did n&apos;t you know
            that? I came to tell you. Look at me, dear, and tell me that you love me and that you
            will come to me. Do, dear.&quot;</p>
          <p>She did look up, all her heart in her honest eyes.</p>
          <p>&quot;I do love you, Tom, but--&quot; she began, when Tom kissed her and the
            pressure of his lips upon hers silenced what she would have said further. His pulses
            were leaping, his eyes shone.</p>
          <p>&quot;You must leave this lonely shack at once--to-morrow--or next day--next week
            at the very latest,&quot; he whispered, holding her close, &quot;and come to the
            Seven-up with me. We are all ready <pb n="344" id="VAA3895-342"/>for you there--oh,
            Josephine, Josephine, I love you so!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You must let me finish what I started to tell you a moment ago,&quot;
            said Josephine, resolutely.</p>
          <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Tom, releasing her and folding his arms as if that
            were the only way he could trust himself to keep them to himself. &quot;Proceed.
            What were you going to say when I interrupted you so rudely?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Jack,&quot; she continued, steadily, &quot;had set his heart on our
            possessing this tract of bottom land on the river. I shall not disappoint him. We
            dreamed many dreams together, Jack and I. He did his share toward bringing about their
            fulfilment. I have mine yet to do. A little while ago, I shrank from my part. It is
            different now. I shall live on my land as Jack lived on his until it is mine. I shall
            have earned it twice over, I think. I think that no one can find fault with me and call
            me a land-grabber when I--bring it to you. We paid for it with blood. Let no one think
            to cheat me out of what has been so dearly bought.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;No one would wish to do that, Josephine. The stock-raisers are
            horror-stricken over-- <pb n="345" id="VAA3895-343"/>what happened. We have done some
            grumbling, it is true, in regard to homesteaders in general, for settlement means that
            we can no longer let our large herds roam where they will; it means that we will no
            longer have thousands of acres of free pasture; it means that we will have to give up
            the vocation that we love so well. But however much the stock-raisers have disliked to
            see the homesteaders come into the country, they have never thought of taking arbitrary
            means to keep them out. The feeling against homesteaders that exists in the cattle
            country had nothing to do with what happened. No one would wish to deprive you of your
            homestead, Josephine, but you cannot live here alone. You must marry me now. Let the old
            claim go. You have Jack&apos;s--that is enough. No, Josephine, I cannot consent to
            your staying here alone,&quot; he said, with a new ring of authority in his
            voice.</p>
          <p>&quot;I am not alone,&quot; she answered, with unchanging purpose,
            &quot;and Rosebud is faithful.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;At least you will commute in eight months?&quot; he urged, realizing the
            utter futility of further effort to turn her from her inflexible purpose.</p>
          <p>&quot;Let us not cross the bridge until we get to it,&quot; she said, demurely,
            with which unsatisfactory <pb n="[]" id="VAA3895-344"/>statement he was forced to be
            content for the time being.</p>
          <p>&quot;Just two girls alone,&quot; protested Tom, returning to his original
            plaint, unreconciled. &quot;I cannot bear to think of it.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;You will come to see us sometimes, won&apos;t you, Tom?&quot; she
            asked smiling.</p>
