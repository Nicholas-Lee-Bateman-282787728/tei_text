            <p>The attitude of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> toward the development of the West is a striking manifestation of the clearness of
                    vision and soundness of judgment which made him the leader of his contemporaries and the founder of
                    the American nation. It is also significant as a tie which binds us, of the interior of the
                    continent and of a state formed nearly two decades after his death, to the great Virginian whose
                    career is too often associated solely with the thirteen original states. In the commemoration of the
                    second centennial of the birth of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it is fitting and proper to recall that he not only won independence and founded a
                    nation, but that he saw the path of its destiny and worked effectively to promote its progress
                    therein. "The Winning of the West" was half of the Revolution and the development
                    of the West was to be even a larger part of the task of the new-born nation.</p>
            <p>From the time when Jamestown was established, the area of settlement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> moved westward at a rate ordinarily stated as fifty miles a generation. The Washington
                    family was part of the seaboard westward movement. Augustine <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> developed an estate at Wakefield on the lower Potomac, now being carefully restored as

                    introduced in the English world twenty years afterward, George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    Even before the maturity of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, however, occupation of land by more mobile families had proceeded to the foothills of
                    the Appalachian Mountains. Here necessarily the westward movement paused, held back by the
                    difficulty of traversing the mountains and by the double menace of the French and Indians beyond the
                    mountains. The breaking down of these barriers was the first great step toward the occupation of the
                    interior of the continent.</p>
            <p>In this task, circumstances and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own character brought him to leadership in his early twenties. He was chosen
                    by Governor Robert Dinwiddie to take a message to the commander of the vanguard of the French that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> claimed the land west of the mountains, a warning to the French to keep out of the
                        <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>. This was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first trip across the mountains to the West. He secured the services of an
                    experienced woodsman, Christopher Gist, and in the winter of 1753-1754 performed his mission,
                    surmounting difficulties and dangers, the record of which is preserved in one of the journals in
                    which he recorded briefly the bare facts of his career. On the west side of the mountains, he had to
                    go up the Allegheny River to Venango (the present <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>), then
                    up French Creek to its source where stood Fort Le Boeuf (the present Water-ford, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>). Here he delivered his message to the French commandant, Le Gardeur de St. Pierre. His
                    return overland was even more dangerous and arduous than his trip out. During this ten weeks of
                    anxiety and hardship <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    successful and, like all good farmers, from time to time he extended his holdings, adding to his
                    inheritance and to the estates brought to him by his wife. He became one of the largest landholders
                    in the country. With his interest in the West, it was only natural that he should acquire large
                    tracts of western land. The first opportunity to do this came with the proclamation of Governor
                    Dinwiddie of February 19, 1754, promising to <placeName>

            <p>A great deal had to be done, however, before title could be secured to any land under the

                    had to be made. Each of these seemingly required the personal supervision of the claimants or their
                    representatives and involved endless difficulties. <placeName>

                    of claimants, assessed costs and went to no end of trouble to bring the matter to a successful and
                    satisfactory conclusion. In 1771 he wrote that ten of the largest tracts, containing 60,000 acres,
                    to be given to the officers and soldiers, had been surveyed. The cost of surveying was

                            largest Tract I now have (composing a full moiety of my quantum) as every inch of it, from

                            whole country, I should have fixed in this Survey, but because I thought (after the Land

                            received from Mr. Blair (clerk of the Council), to believe, that your Lordship is desirous
                            of being fully informed how far the grant of land solicited by Mr. Wallpole and others will
                            affect the interest of this country in general, or individuals in particular, I shall take
                            the liberty (being pretty intimately acquainted with the situation of the frontiers of this
                            dominion) to inform your Lordship, that the bounds of that grant, if obtained upon the
                            extensive plan prayed for, will comprehend at least four fifths of the land, for which this
                            government hath lately voted two thousand five hundred pounds sterling, the purchase and
                            survey of! and must destroy the well grounded hopes of those, (if no reservation is made in
                            their favor,) who have had the strongest assurances, which government could give, of
                            enjoying a certain portion of the lands, which have cost this country so much blood and
                            treasure to secure.</p>
                        <p>By the extracts, which your Excellency did me the honor to enclose, I perceive, that the
                            petitioners require to begin opposite to the mouth of Scioto, which is at least seventy or
                            seventy-five miles below the mouth of the Big Kanhawa, (and more than three hundred from
                            Pittsburg,) and to extend from thence in a southwardly direction through the pass of the
                            Ouasioto Mountain, which, (by Evans's map, and the best accounts I have been able
                            to get from persons, who have explored that country,) will bring them near the latitude of <placeName>

                            </placeName>. From thence they go northeastwardly to the Kanhawa, at the junction of New

                            patented. From thence they proceed up the Green Briar to the head of the northeasterly
                            branch there-of, thence easterly to the Allegany Mountains, thence along these mountains to

                        <p>These, my Lord, are the bounds of a grant prayed for, and if obtained, will give a fatal
                            blow, in my humble opinion, to the interests of this country. But these are my sentiments as
                            a member of the community at large; but I now beg leave to offer myself to your

                            They seem fully impressed with the political as well as the commercial advantages, which
                            would result from the accomplishment of these great objects, and I hope will embrace the
                            present moment to put them in train for speedy execution. Would it not, at the same time, be
                            worthy of the wisdom and attention of Congress to have the western waters well explored, the
                            navigation of them fully ascertained, accurately laid down, and a complete and perfect map
                            made of the country; at least as far westwardly as the Miamies, running into the <placeName>

                            to a very important post for the Union. The expense attending the undertaking could not be

                    friend, Thomas Jefferson, in the ordinance of 1785, which provided for geometrical division into
                    square townships and sections, with-out reference to natural features. This system has been such a
                    convenience that it is difficult now to understand how one could prefer the irregularities and

                    </placeName>, with his wide experience and vision, sensed the great problem of western settlements,
                    that of communication. How could settlers get their produce to market? Two possibilities were
                    apparent in the last quarter of the eighteenth century: eastward to the Atlantic seaboard, and
                    southward down the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. There was also danger that the West might separate itself entirely from the states to

                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>

                    Perhaps the location of his own lands along this line of communication influenced his judgment. But
                    that his public policy was dictated by his private interests, as is some-times asserted, is a gross

            <p>His own utterances make his position clear. At one time he said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            that trade well established, and it will be found to be no easy matter to divert it, and
                            vice versa. When the settlements are stronger and more extended to the westward, the

            <head>Internal Improvements without a Policy (1789-1861)</head>
            <byline>By VICTOR L. ALBJERG</byline>
            <p>Few domestic issues attracted greater attention during the early period of American history than did
                    the question of internal improvements. Judged by the space devoted to it in the <hi rend="i">Annals
                        of Congress</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Debates in Congress</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Congressional
                        Globe</hi>, it was of paramount interest. Evaluated according to the amount appropriated, it
                    occupied a position of much less significance. The first session of the seventieth congress
                    appropriated almost twice as much for the improvement of a single harbor as did all of the
                    congresses prior to the Civil War for all purposes of internal improvement.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    During the period from 1789 to 1861, although the amount of debate in Congress on appropriations for
                    lighthouses and fortifications was almost of no consequence, more money was actually appropriated
                    for each of these than was granted for internal improvements.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The policy of
                    internal improvements was, therefore, more important for what it might have become than for what it
                    was. It was finally adopted as a system, but not until after it was no longer keenly needed. After
                    the Civil War there was no real opposition to the federal government's aid in the
                    construction of roads and harbors, but by that time there were other agencies which were in a
                    position to furnish transportation facilities.</p>
            <p>Congress displayed a lack of policy toward internal improvement from the very beginning of its
                    consideration of that subject. In the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> proposed that Congress should have the power to construct canals so that the old
                    provinces could keep in touch with the western settlements. This motion was rejected by a <list type="footnotes">

                    that Congress would become too powerful if it were allowed to exercise such a function. The
                    intention of the Constitutional Convention was, therefore, to deny Congress the right over internal
                    improvements. Yet, Congress eventually brushed aside all constitutional restraint and exercised the
                    very powers which the framers had intended to deny.</p>
            <p>It was generally conceded when internal improvement legislation was approached that Congress had the
                    power to construct roads and canals and improve harbors within the territories where there was no
                    state sovereignty, but that it had no similar rights within the states. Under this interpretation of
                    the Constitution the first appropriations for internal improvements were made within the
                    territories, when three sections of land were granted to Ebenezer Zane for the cutting of a trace
                    from what is now Wheeling, West <placeName>

                    for the construction of roads in the Northwest Territory.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Likewise, the first
                    federal appropriation for the improvement of a river was made within the territories. On February
                    15, 1819, Congress appropriated $6,500 for the "Survey of the Tributaries of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>".<hi rend="sup">6</hi> But the policy of confining appropriations to the
                    territories was abandoned almost as soon as it was put into operation, for in 1806 Congress extended
                    the operation of its power to the states but only after it had secured permission from the state
                    through which the improvement was to be made.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> State sovereignty was not to be
                    violated.</p>
            <p>The War of 1812, through an undeniable necessity, had accustomed the people to a greater reliance
                    upon the federal government, and they had come to look upon it as the proper instrumentality by
                    which their welfare should be promoted. Consequently in 1826, Congress harmonized its own
                    convictions with the popular desires when it appropriated federal money for the improvement of the
                    Savannah River.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> This was the first appropriation within a state without

                    not until 1822 that the national legislature seriously challenged his policy by passing of the Tolls

                    works of internal improvement provided that these were "national not state, general not
                    local". Such a definition permitted an elastic interpretation soothing to executive logic
                    and conscience. The result of this message was the passage of the Survey Bill in 1824 which created
                    a board whose duties it should be to determine projects which complied with the President's
                    criterion. This body interpreted liberally the term, "national". Consequently,

            <p>Never did a cause secure more enthusiastic support than that given to internal improvements by John
                    Quincy Adams. In his inaugural address he was convinced that because of internal improvements the

                    derive their most fervent gratitude to the founders of the Union; that in which the beneficent

                    While the earlier presidents had held the use of powers not specifically granted to be
                    unconstitutional, Adams declared that the exercise of powers "is a duty as sacred and
                    indispensable as the usurpation of powers not granted is criminal and odious".<hi rend="sup">23</hi> With that conception of the Constitution added to his native ardor for roads
                    and canals he did not lessen the gratitude of the "unborn millions" by appointing

                    of Engineers created in 1824 surveyed cities for improvement and furnished Congress with information
                    which it used as a basis for legislation. During Adams' administration more money was

                    the exercise of the power which would have compensated for his vacillation. While Jackson had been a
                    member of the Senate he had voted for six internal improvement bills, three of which were opposed by

                    candidacy and obtain western support had truckled to it (internal improvement policy) for a while
                    and had now taken a decided stand against it",<hi rend="sup">29</hi> while Calhoun had
                    "turned his back upon it", and "Webster had silently given it
                    up".</p>
            <p>The bolts of Jackson's thunder against internal improvements were, however, much less
                    destructive than their detonations indicated. The joy of the strict constructionists must have
                    vanished before their chief left office, for while he had been most emphatic in his denunciations of
                    internal improvements he had also been most liberal in extending federal aid. Practically one third
                    of all the federal money spent for internal improvements from 1789 to 1861 was raised during the
                    eight years of Jackson's administrations. Yet, by his Maysville veto, he had stemmed the
                    tide of federal appropriations for roads and canals, rivers and harbors. In 1831 the House committee
                    on internal improvements reported bills which called for $104,243,740.71.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Had Henry Clay been President, the fondest hopes of the enthusiasts for internal

            <p>It was during the presidencies of Adams and Jackson that Indiana profited most from federal
                    assistance which was limited to the gift of five per cent of the land sales in the state, and aid in
                    the construction of four major projects. Receipts under the five per cent sales began pouring into
                    the treasury of the state in 1820 and continued until 1856 when the total amount from this source
                    reached $620,352.92.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Three-fifths of this sum was spent for roads

                    of transport and communication between the East and the West. The total cost of its construction was

                    persistent agitation was carried on by Indiana's representatives in Congress with a view to
                    the cutting of a canal that would unite the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> with <geogName>Lake
                        Erie</geogName>. A beginning was made in 1824 when Congress granted a strip of land 320 feet
                    wide through the public domain for the construction of the pro-posed canal. This offer was, however,
                    rejected by Indiana and new efforts were made to secure federal assistance which resulted in the act
                    of March 2, 1827, which donated a canal route and the alternate sections to a depth of five miles on
                    each side of the canal. Four subsequent grants of land were made which brought the total land

                    administrations. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren professed to have accepted the policies of Jackson. Nevertheless he approved
                    internal improvement bills of purely local concern.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> He placed his signature to
                    river and harbor bills, making larger appropriations than any that had been passed before his
                        administration.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Tyler did nothing to clarify or formulate a policy, but
                    Polk when he entered the White House pursued a course strikingly in contrast with that of John
                    Quincy Adams. While the latter had invited and encouraged such legislation, Polk with one exception,
                    and that was a military road bill for the army during the Mexican War, vetoed every internal
                    improvement bill which was submitted for his consideration.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> He interpreted the
                    Constitution more strictly on this subject than any of his predecessors had done or any of his
                    successors were to do. On the last night of his term he went to his office armed with a veto for any
                    internal improvement bill which Congress might pass. During his administration the internal
                    improvement enthusiasts lost more ground than they had gained in almost half a century of agitation.</p>
            <p>But the vacillation continued. On August 30,1852, Fill-more placed his signature to a river and
                    harbor bill which provided for the expenditure of a larger sum than did any other measure passed
                    before the Civil War.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> He granted what Polk had been unwilling to allow. Pierce
                    attempted to reverse this policy by vetoing five river and harbor bills on the ground of
                    unconstitutionality. After almost sixty years of continuous agitation Congress found itself for the
                    first time sufficiently united on this question to pass all of them over the executive veto. Not
                    only had the Presidents failed in executive leader-ship, but they had been contradictory in their
                    interpretation <list type="footnotes">

                    internal improvements, while the national legislature did little to compensate for executive
                    deficiency. There was always a strong opposition which supported the Presidents in denying to
                    Congress the power to execute a system of internal improvements. Even the staunchest state rights
                    men were willing to compromise their convictions for appropriations within their own states. Senator
                    Branch of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName>, emphatically denied the right to Congress to make internal improvements, but when an
                    appropriation for improvements within his own state was included in the river and harbor bill for
                    1825, he confessed that he would not let a morbid sensibility prevent his accepting the boon.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Whereupon Senator John Chandler of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> cried: "Help, Lord—the Mighty Man Faileth; this was the first bone
                    held to the gentleman and he bit".<hi rend="sup">44</hi> There were others less frank but
                    equally susceptible. The Democratic Convention of 1835 included a resolution in its platform denying
                    to Congress the right to effect internal improvements yet each year saw the national legislature
                    violate the party pledge. Presidential candidates were either evasive or irresponsible. In 1848 the
                    Democratic Convention declared "that the Constitution does not confer upon Congress the
                    power to commence and carry on a general system of internal improvement". In accepting the
                    platform of 1848, Cass declared he adhered to it as firmly as he approved it cordially. Yet, when he
                    had been in the senate he had voted for every internal improvement bill that had come up.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> It is not so surprising that some of the abler men of the day were out of
                    sympathy with such lack of consistency and absence of policy. When the constitutional objection was
                    brought against a bill for internal improvements in 1852, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> in his last speech on this subject asked how long it would be "before the
                    people would rise up en masse and trample down your little hairsplitting distinctions about what is
                    national and state and demand what is fair and just." Seven years later Stephen A. Douglas
                    in exasperation declared that "this whole system has proved a failure".<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>David was one of twelve sisters and brothers, and he speaks of them all as loving books and poetry.
                    He speaks of his father as being of brilliant wit and well educated for a farmer. There is a touch
                    of poetic beauty in the description which he gives of his life after his father had migrated to

                            study law, and offered me the use of his books for that purpose… and on the first
                            day of January 1829, I commenced studying law. During that year I studied eight hours per

                    </placeName> as a member of the Legislature during the session of 1833-1834. He felt that it was

                    irregularities among those gentlemen who were in politics that disgusted him. He was elected Judge
                    of the tenth Circuit Court of Indiana in 1838 which place he led for fourteen years. He moved to <placeName>

                    law at Indiana University. In regard to this he states: "My connection with the university
                    was highly advantageous to me, as it brought me [into] intimate [contact] with that great and good
                    man, Dr. Andrew Wylie, and with other learned men." During that time he picked up a good
                    deal of learning and studied Latin without a teacher.</p>

                            first-rate. Judge McDonald was one of the kindest men that ever lived, and if the members of
                            his class had been his own sons he could not have taken more interest in them,—in
                            his class room a strict disciplinarian; outside, a boy with us…. The Judge every

                            be at home tomorrow evening." We knew that this meant a dozen or more village girls

                            was not an orthodox Methodist, and because my wife was no Methodist at all." Mrs.
                            McDonald was a Presbyterian. dge McDonald held Unitarian beliefs, though he was a member of
                            a Methodist church.</item>

            <p>On December 28, 1858, McDonald visited the Supreme Court rooms. He recorded his first impressions:
                    "After sitting there a while, the judges marched in headed by the Chief Justice. They wore
                    black gowns. The impression the first sight of them gave me was that of weary, worn out, feeble old
                    men whose places would be rather in chimney corners than here." The Hoosier attorney was
                    then seeking the privilege of practising before the federal courts. In regard to this, he wrote of
                    the outcome: "Mr. Richard Thompson moved the ad-mission. The Chief Justice assented. I
                    walked forward looking as big as possible. The clerk swore me—charged me
                    $6.50. I paid it—took my seal and license—and went to

                            giving all my efforts to my profession. I have not been much of a politician and while I
                            concede that politicians ought to be preferred in politics, I claim for those who have
                            followed the law only a like preference in judicial office. I am too modest to mention my

                            Hendricks was called in. He had a long talk with the President about me. Then I was called
                            in. The President said he had thought of making me judge in McLean's place. This he
                            said was at the request of Bishop Simpson. Afterwards he said he had thought seriously of me
                            when he appointed Smith, and also when he had appointed White. He said he cared nothing
                            about recommendations: He said in fine, everything from which I might infer that he would
                            appoint me without promising it directly. I feel sure he will do it. Yet the doubt and

            <p>Senator Henry S. Lane was, of course, interested in the appointment of a federal judge for the
                    Indiana District. When Judge McDonald first encountered Lane, he did not get much comfort from him.
                    In regard to the attitude of the Senator, McDonald records: "He says he has recommended
                    several of us to the President for the judgeship and now having done his whole duty, he says he
                    leaves it to the President to do his!!!" Several days passed after Hendricks had taken
                    McDonald to see Lincoln with no developments. Meanwhile Judge James Hughes, once a bitter enemy but
                    now a close friend of McDonald, was without success constantly making attempts to see the President.
                    On Monday, December 12, Lane was privileged to carry good news to his able but anxious constituent:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">

                            spoke thus "The President sent for me this morning. I went. He asked me if there
                            was any good reason why McDonald should not be appointed as Judge? I answered, none in the
                            world. Then said the President, I will appoint him."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>On the way home, the car in which Judge McDonald was riding left the track, broke loose from the
                    train and turned over. This accident occurred during the night and great confusion reigned for
                    several minutes. No one was seriously injured. McDonald and his fellow passengers succeeded in
                    getting out of the car and, having successfully avoided other dangers, were soon on board the train
                    again, which had returned to the scene after running a short distance down the line. McDonald <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In 1868, about a year before his death, Judge McDonald declared that he considered his appointment as
                    District Judge the "most fortunate circumstance" in his life. For ten years, he
                    had practised his profession in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These were strenuous years, and his work had become a heavy burden. As Judge, he
                    promised himself "many happy years of easy work and leisure." He lived but little
                    more than four and one-half years after his selection to the District Judgeship, however, years of
                    hard labor, ill-health and other afflictions.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In April, 1866, he was taken with some form of spinal disease which sadly affected him. Sometimes he
                    was unable to attend to official business and never without suffering. He died on August 25, 1869,
                    of what would today be called typhoid-dysentery. Medical science could now have controlled it
                    readily. He not only performed the arduous duties of his judicial station, increased fourfold after
                    the passage of the Bankrupt Law, but actually engaged in the formidable task of revising and
                    preparing his judicial opinions in important cases for publication. When urged to desist from this
                    great labor and take a journey for his health, he showed impatience and declared his duties were not
                    burdensome and that he was not at all overworked. He had learned to work so incessantly that the
                    briefest respite from labor seemed to him like idleness. He loved his profession with a devoted love
                    and revered the memory of great men who had made that profession illustrious. In his hours of
                    relaxation he would turn with fondness to the names of great lawyers whose memory he tenderly
                    cherished.</p>
            <p>At the funeral of Judge McDonald, his friend and law partner, Albert G. Porter, gave a sketch of his
                    life. "Delicacy", declared Mr. Porter, "does not compell us to suppress
                    the mention of any vice. His life was stainless." The father of the Judge died when the
                    latter was fourteen years of age. His last words to the boy were, "My son, be a good
                    man." He kept the injunction laid upon him. The corner stones of his character, as listed
                    by Porter were: "Integrity, Honor, Magnanimity, <list type="footnotes">

                    persuasion, perfect in the seeming absence of that art, the power of winning juries and leading them
                    to adopt his own conclusions, he never, though he did not aspire to the distinction of an orator,

                    courtesy, especially to young lawyers, who practised before him.</p>
            <p>The committee selected from among the lawyers who practised before Judge McDonald's Court

                    was a work designed for the use of those local officials, so important in that day, justices of the

                    several times. Whether regarded as a Circuit Judge, a professor of law, a practising lawyer, a
                    writer, or a federal District Judge, David McDonald was a distinguished man. His success was the
                    more remarkable when it is remembered, "how without teachers he became a scholar; how
                    without books of his own, he became an adept in literature, and how by his energy, talent and

            <p>During a period of years, embracing the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth
                    centuries, a great many families left <placeName>

                    </placeName> for the Old Northwest. A number of them settled in southwestern <placeName>

                    </placeName> and in adjacent areas of Indiana. Among these colonists were several of the Whitakers.
                    A sister of William Whitaker came to Clermont County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1797. A few years later she married Boaz Thorp, also from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName>. They came to Indiana Territory at about the time of the breaking out of the War of
                    1812. Not later than 1813, they settled in the Whitewater country in what is now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, near the present line between that County and <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>This Thorp family was among the first to locate in this neighborhood. The original family to occupy
                    land in the same congressional township was one by the name of Simonda who arrived in 1811. The
                    tradition is that there were three children in the Thorp family when they built their Indiana cabin
                    home of the usual type. The father proceeded to subdue the forest and cultivate the virgin soil. He
                    produced a comfortable living for his family. The land entered by Thorp, as described by the owner
                    and occupant of the same tract in 1895, lay near Simonds Creek, a half-mile northwest of the present
                    town of <placeName>

            <p>In the fall of 1814, as accurately, perhaps, as the date can be known, the Thorp family was stricken

            <p>The mother's grief was great and her lamentations attracted attention from the Simonds

                            <placeName>
                  <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, which he repeated to a citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in which he claimed that he was a guest in the Thorp home when the little daughter was
                    carried away. The Rev. Sharpe was a pioneer Methodist preacher, riding the Whitewater Circuit at the
                    time, according to his own testimony. He remembered the event as having occurred either in 1813 or
                    1814.</p>
            <p>The bereaved father, Boaz Thorp, spent several years in a protracted search for his missing daughter.
                    He traveled over a large area in the guise of an Indian trader, visiting Miami and Pottawattomie
                    tribes in their villages and encampments. The long quest proved unfruitful, but the family continued
                    to hope that some day the lost daughter might be found. To get away from scenes that stirred up such
                    sad memories, the family, after some years, moved to a new home in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette County</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>After the lapse of many years, Mr. and Mrs. Thorp were led to believe from information received that
                    their daughter was still alive and with the Miami Indians in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> country of north-central Indiana. Thither they went in the hope of finding the object
                    of their affections. They were rewarded by finding the daughter, now grown to womanhood, near
                    Ashland, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash County</region>
                    </placeName>. She was the wife of a Miami Indian, Captain Dixon. She was identified by a scar on her
                    body, which had been caused by the dropping of a coal of fire from the mother's pipe when
                    an infant. The young woman was questioned, but showed not even the faintest recollection <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-028-3-042"/> of her early child life at the frontier home in the Whitewater country.
                    Neither did she manifest any desire to leave the people among whom she had lived.</p>
            <p>Captain Dixon was a profligate, dissolute, and thriftless character. The daughter of Boaz Thorp was
                    said by her white neighbors to be a kind and affectionate wife and mother and polite towards her
                    neighbors. She made some exertions to educate her children. In 1850, or near that time, Captain
                    Dixon, in a drunken row with a Pottawattomie Indian, who used a heavy garden hoe as a weapon of
                    defense, suffered a fractured skull. He died the following day. A party of his tribe hauled his body
                    home on a sled. Shortly before or after his death, his wife ended her strange career by her own act.
                    She committeed suicide by drowning herself in the Mississinewa River at the mouth of Grant Creek,
                    about a half-mile distant from her Indian home.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <byline>By CHRISTOPHER B. COLEMAN</byline>
            <p>The September number of the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi> is devoted to history in the
                    high schools under the title of "High School Number." The Society is making a
                    special effort to co$oUperate with the teachers of history in the schools of Indiana and
                    to enlist them in its membership. It is extending to them the privilege of membership from
                    September, 1932 to December 31, 1933, sixteen months, upon the payment of the regular dues of two
                    dollars for one year.</p>
            <p>There is no reason why the Indiana Historical Society should not for this state, occupy the position
                    that the American Historical Association does for the country at large. It ought to be the clearing
                    house for historical activities in the schools as well as among men and women in other walks of
                    life. The word "Indiana" in the name of the Society ought to be construed
                    geographically rather than topically. While Indiana history is naturally emphasized and given more
                    attentian than any other field, the program of the Society ought to include the general field of
                    historical reading, study, and teaching. To an increasing extent, such subjects are being included
                    in meetings of historical societies in the state.</p>
            <p>The "High School Number" of the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi> can be
                    secured without cost at the Historical Bureau, 334 State House. It should be read by all teachers of
                    history, especially those in the high schools of the state.</p>
            <p>The new State Library and Historical Building is progressing rapidly, It is on the southwest corner

                    work has been carried to the top of the third floor, nearly the height of the finished building. The
                    contract calls for completion of the building in July of 1933. It will house the State Library, the
                    Historical Bureau, Public Archives, and the William Henry Smith Memorial Library of the Indiana
                    Historical Society.</p>

                    she wrote many years ago concerning Morgan's Raid. Mrs. Coffin, then Miss Morrison, had

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> when Morgan's Raid threatened that town. Among the many incidents recalled
                    were the saving of securities from the bank by hiding them in private houses, the preparation of a
                    bounteous lunch for the home guards drilling in the town square which was served instead to
                    Morgan's men, the filling of an empty cistern with goods from the neighboring store and
                    labelling the store "for rent," and the hiding of a Captain Thomas. There are not
                    so many survivors of the time of Morgan's Raid now living that the recollections of such
                    persons as Mrs. Coffin can be overlooked.</p>

            <head>DIARY OF TAYLOR N. SNOW, HOOSIER FIFTY-NINER</head>
            <byline>By ARTHUR HOMER HAYS</byline>
            <p>
                    <hi rend="i">Introduction</hi>
                </p>
            <p>The memory book and diary of Taylor N. Snow stands as a tribute to the character of the man. This old
                    book, bound in sheepskin, now dog-eared and worn with use, was found in 1862 abandoned to the
                    fortunes of an old trunk. The latter reposed on the site of an old, unused camping place near the
                    point where the overland trail to old Fort Hall in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="idu">Idaho</region>
                    </placeName> and that to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> separated. Exactly where this camping site was located no living man knows.</p>
            <p>The finder and preserver of this document was Benjamin F. Hawes, who, after spending some time in the
                    Boise Basin gold fields of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="idu">Idaho</region>
                    </placeName>, returned part way over the old trail to meet his wife, Margaret, and his brother,
                    Fletcher A. Hawes, who were coming from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, to join him. From that day to
                    this, the old book has been preserved as a memento of that journey.</p>
            <p>Just how the old diary came to be in that old trunk may never be known. Benjamin F. Hawes, for years
                    a cattleman in the beautiful Bruneau valley of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="idu">Idaho</region>
                    </placeName>, is dead. His wife is also dead. Fletcher A. Hawes, the brother, was killed by Indians
                    during the Bannoch war. Even they knew nothing of the history of the document between the last
                    entry, August 15, 1859, and the date of its finding. This leaves much that cannot be explained. We
                    read in the diary, July 31, 1859, that the Fort Hall road was passed on that day. Also, that the
                    diarist reached the Humbolt on August 6, and was still moving westward along that stream up to
                    August 15. The Hawes family came southward from Fort Hall. How did the diary find its way back to
                    the place where it was found in the trunk? What became of Taylor N. Snow? What led him to abandon
                    the diary, his companion through so many hardships?</p>
            <p>From the diary we find that Snow lived in Indiana until early in the year 1859, when he entered the
                    long, dangerladen trail into the trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> West. His diary tells a story of hardship and heroism of interest to every
                    Hoosier—to every <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-028-3-046"/> American.</p>
            <p>In reading words written by a hand long dead, one is inspired to reverence. Here we find set down the
                    innermost thoughts of a sensitive soul, a soul wafted here and there by the breezes of an unkind
                    fate, seemingly against his will. Many of the lines written in the old book are
                    sacred—too sacred, perhaps, for living man to read.</p>
            <p>Taylor N. Snow was a lover of literature, and appears to have treasured in his mind the lines of such
                    poets as Shelly, Burns, Dana, and Moore. These, he quoted freely, evidently from memory, judging
                    from certain imperfections of punctuation and spelling. An amorous being was the diarist for he
                    speaks much of love. He was a philosopher, an observer of life, which, like many another man, he
                    tried vainly to interpret. He was at heart a poet but a poet without technique. He left behind
                    several of his efforts.</p>
            <p>Why Taylor N. Snow left Indiana is unknown. It may have been to get away from the
                    "call" to enter the ministry. Such is intimated in his diary. It may have been a
                    love affair that sent him forth. One of his rhymes, which he inscribed to Miss M. E. C., indicates
                    that he was a disappointed lover: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Farewell! Mary farewell! forever I will leave you for to weep For our vows of love are broken
                            And I am going to the Peak</p>
                        <p>Farewell! Mary farewell! forever Tho that word is hard to speak Your [You're] the
                            one that broke those vows And I am going to the Peak</p>
                        <p>Farewell! Mary farewell for ever You another's hand may take For you left me all
                            alone And I am going to the Peak</p>
                        <p>Farewell Mary farewell forever Alas w'll soon our parting take No more I'll
                            claim you for my own For I am going to the Peak.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>It may have been the spirit of adventure that called him away from home. The student of history will
                    recall that the Panic of 1857 had reached its height in the Middle West about <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-028-3-047"/> 1859, sending men out in search of the rainbow's end. And too,
                    these were the days of conflict over slavery in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. The Lincoln-Douglas debates were fresh in men's minds, and the whole slavery
                    question was nearing armed conflict. The Civil War was in the offing. Added to this was the lure of
                    gold. The yellow metal had been discovered in the west. For ten years men had been going to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> by the thousands, and news of rich finds fired the heart of youth. In 1858, a rich
                    strike was made at Pikes Peak, and the following year, gold seekers started for the new field.
                    Before the end of a year, a government had been set up, and a new Territory to be called
                    "Jefferson" proposed to Congress.</p>
            <p>And so we find Taylor N. Snow declaring that he was "going to the Peak", ready to
                    join a vast army of seekers after adventure and wealth. While at Des Moines, he attempted to express
                    his purpose in verse. In three stansas, he said "Farewell to Indiana and to the girl he
                    left behind." His plans changed, however, and he did not go to <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName> but pressed on toward <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The girl left behind, Miss M. E. C., was evidently Mary Ellen Carskaden of Tarricopee, Indiana, whose
                    name and address appear elsewhere in the book where he kept his diary, in a list of some hundred or
                    more names with addresses. The spirit of abandon to pleasure seen in the last mentioned poem was
                    that of the moment only for the diarist was a serious man, given to things worth while.</p>
            <p>Snow was a young man of some standing at home. An older friend who controlled a scholarship in one of
                    the Universities of the State, probably the State University at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, offered it to him in September, 1857. He probably did not take advantage of this
                    opportunity to go to college. He must have served as township trustee in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren County</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1854, since he left behind a copy of a contract with a Sophia Sailor to teach a
                    term of school, the contract being signed "Taylor N. Snow". He likewise left among
                    the records of his memory book rules for the conduct of children in school, a list of subjects for
                    debate, and nine rhyming stanzas in relation to parts of speech.</p>
            <p>It is not possible to determine the age of Taylor N. Snow when he started on his western adventure,
                    but he must have been more than thirty years old. He stayed in Des Moines, <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-028-3-048"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, for several weeks before taking the trail for the gold country. The diary covers the
                    period from May 5 to August 15,1859. At the latter date, the entries cease. From that day forward,
                    the writer of this foreword has no information relative to the diarist. What became of Taylor N.
                    Snow, some reader of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> may be able to reveal. The
                    entries in the diary, show the growing difficulty under which he kept his journal. At first he used
                    ink and pen, writing carefully under evident conditions of leisure and ease. But upon the hard
                    trail, we can picture him near the camp fire, writing on his knee or on the
                    ground—perhaps on the tire of a wagon wheel. Careful writing gives way to hastily
                    scribbled lines; for danger lurks near in the night. Indians are camping in the shadows. Ink and pen
                    are gone. Only the stub of a pencil remains. The diary stops abruptly with the entry of August 15.</p>

                        high time that its origin and definition should be generally known; before that section of the
                        public lands was regularly surveyed—many families located and were called
                        squatters—the surveyor on finding one of these would ask who's here, and
                        place the name on their map—the question became so familiar, that on the first view
                        of the smoke of a cabin, the exclamation of another "who's here"
                        became equally so, until its eventuated in the general term of Hoosiers.</p>

                    being received with high favor, and which is selling at a high price even in the midst of an
                    unprecedented depression. The new book carries the title, <hi rend="i">Beveridge and the Progressive
                        Era.</hi> It will appeal strongly to Indiana readers.</p>
            <p>This piece of writing by Mr. Bowers is in the nature of a new venture on his part. In his earlier
                    volumes, he was presenting men and events as the champion of Republicans over against Federalists,
                    Democrats against Whigs, and Democrats against the Radical Republicans of the period of political
                    reconstruction or "age of hate." In the Beveridge treatise, he has been led to
                    study a recent era with a view to giving due credit to a leader who was not a Democrat though he was
                    by no means a regular Republican. The effort has been good for the author, and, in respect to
                    partisan bias, he has shown substantial improvement. With his acquired experience as an invesigator,
                    his facility as a writer, and his productive zeal, readers of American history can only desire that
                    he will continue to write. One hope is yet indulged by students who are primarily interested in
                    getting at the truth—that Mr. Bowers will become as anxious to write history in a spirit
                    of detachment as did his sincere friend, Albert J. Beveridge, when preparing his volumes on Lincoln.
                    The new book by Mr. Bowers is a publication of the Houghton Mifflin Company which retails at
                    $5.00.</p>

                    occupies over sixty printed pages.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the diary which extends to July 18, occupies a little more than a hundred pages. In
                    these entries, the artist furnishes matter pertaining to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> of that day. He journeyed to the Territory "to satisfy a visual
                    craving—to see at first hand the natives, their villages, their custumes, their utensils,
                    their dances, their feasts, their ceremonies—rather than to learn how the Great Father at <placeName>

                    at a few cents an acre." To this comment Miss Heilbron adds: "It is just possible
                    that the artist's overwhelming interest in the natives accounts for the fact that the
                    emphasis in his diary is on Indian life and that the treaties of 1857 are neglected."</p>
            <p>The printed diary is accompanied by illustrations which are reproductions of the sketches by the
                    pencil of Mayer. These add much to the value and interest of the book for the reader. This small

            <head>Comment</head>
            <p>Americans who experienced an appreciable period of mature life before the age of the automobile, the
                    movie and the airplane are fast growing old. Among men and women who reached maturity in the
                    eighties or nineties and who have never become fully accustomed to the things of the new era, there
                    is a feeling that there has been a good deal of loss. Admitedly, it is better to live. in a day of
                    individual communion sets, sanitary drinking fountains, comfortable clothing, outdoor activities,
                    electric washers, and cleaning and pressing establishments. No one wants to drink from the common
                    cup at the town pump again, or wear a frock coat at his daily work, or return to the wash-board and
                    soft soap, or buy crackers out of the barrel where the cat sleeps–all agree that it is
                    well that those days are gone forever. It is however, only natural that reflective individuals whose
                    days of manhood or womanhood have been about equally divided between the older and newer regime
                    should often feel sorry for a generation of men and women, now rapidly coming into control, who were
                    born into a world of speeding cars and movie performances that succeed each other in a never-ending
                    series, to which has been added the radio to furnish distraction for all leisure time not taken up
                    in whizzing over pavements or looking at the screen in the theater.</p>
            <p>In the year, 1932, we have seen the Congress of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, at the behest of the President, increase taxes and cut wages for government employees
                    in order "to balance the budget". We have also seen the Indiana Legislature, and
                    those of many other states, decreasing taxes and cutting down the pay of all employees of the state
                    and local governments in order to relieve men of property of their public burdens. In both nation
                    and states, the process has been carried on without understanding or intelligent discrimination. The
                    general demand for economy in the conduct of public affairs has been met almost entirely through
                    forcing sacrifices upon employees of the national, state and local governments. The process has not
                    increased prosperity—rather the reverse is true, because the demand for goods has been
                    lessened. It is to be hoped that more <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-028-3-066"/> fundamental and just
                    methods of bringing about governmental economies will be discovered in future sessions of Congress
                    and state Legislatures.</p>
            <p>The people of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> will soon be confronted with the problems connected with caring for the destitute
                    during the fourth winter of the great depression. It has been proposed to employers that such work
                    as they have to offer shall be "spread" among as many workers as possible. The
                    proposal seems to many worthy citizens, especially to those who are weary of repeated calls to
                    contribute to community chests, to be a wise one. In the case of work created to relieve
                    unemployment, there can be no valid objection to the idea of "spreading work". In
                    all industries and institutions where varying degrees of activity have been kept up during the
                    depression, where employees may be said to have jobs of their own, there is a fundamental question
                    at issue. To take away a part of a man's job, usually his only source of income, and give
                    it to another, is to say the least a new and startling departure. Such a policy may be justifiable
                    in the present emergency, but if so, why is it not equally defensible to take a part of a
                    man's business and give it to another. If jobs, acquired through time and patience and
                    industry, can be divided and "spread around," why can not factories, stores,
                    banks, mines, and farms be dealt with in like manner, in order to avoid increasing taxes or
                    donations to community chests?</p>
            <p>Republicans won national victories in 1920, 1924, and 1928. Can this statement be challenged? If the
                    choice of the President by popular and electoral votes be considered, the statement is sound. It is
                    true, nevertheless, that neither of the three Presidents, Harding, Coolidge, or Hoover, has at any
                    time been supported by a working majority in both House and Senate at the same time. No party is
                    ever really in control of the General Government in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, save when the President is able to carry out policies in harmony with majorities in
                    both House and Senate. The greatest defect connected with party government in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> lies just here. Parties and party leaders are only occassionally given the opportunity
                    to carry through constructive programs. Responsibility is hard to locate whether the President is a
                    Republican or a <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-028-3-067"/> Democrat, if either the House or the Senate is
                    controlled by an opposite party.</p>
            <p>Presidents, congressional leaders and people would function better, receive credit for constructive
                    policies and accept responsibility for mistakes much more certainly if a system were adopted making
                    harmony between the President and Congress a necessary basis for the existence of an Administration.
                    Under the Constitution as it stands, the only chance for an efficient and responsible Administration
                    is for the same party to elect the President and a majority in each branch of Congress. A simple
                    remedy for a really serious defect would seem to be: to elect Senators and Representatives all at
                    the same time and for terms of the same length; to have the President chosen by Senate and House,
                    acting jointly for that purpose as a <hi rend="i">national assembly</hi>; and to have any deadlock
                    between House and Senate settled likewise by joint action in said <hi rend="i">national
                    assembly.</hi> As it is, it is seldom true that a political party has a fair chance to govern even
                    when supposedly in power. For this reason all parties should combine to work out some such
                    fundamental change as that mentioned above, which has the merit of being an adaptation of the
                    established American system rather than a system borrowed from another country.</p>
            <p>Under the presidency of Andrew Wylie, who was styled "Professor of Mental and Moral
                    Philosophy and <hi rend="i">Belles Lettres</hi>", something in the nature of history was
                    attached to the curriculum of Indiana University as a side issue. Following a diagram showing the
                    subjects to be taken by freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors, the following note appears in the
                        <hi rend="i">Annual Circular and Catalogue</hi> of Indiana University for the year 1851:
                    "Two lectures on History are delivered every week to the Freshman and Sophomore classes,
                    which are also open to such other students as desire to attend them." Nothing in reference
                    to history appears in earlier catalogues of the University. Whether the lectures were intended as a
                    dessert or a medicine, it is hard to say. Possibly both purposes were in the minds of those who were
                    bold enough to experiment with "Lectures on History" before the students of a
                    struggling college on the frontier.</p>
            <p>The annual Indiana History Conference will be held on <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-028-3-068"/> Friday and
                    Saturday, December 9-10, at the Claypool Hotel in <placeName>

            <p>A New memorial to Abraham Lincoln was dedicated at Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on September 16, 1932. This heroic bronze statue of "Lincoln, The
                    Hoosier Youth", created by Paul Manship under the sponsorship of the Lincoln Life
                    Foundation, stands on the Plaza in front of the Lincoln Life Insurance Company building. The work
                    rises twenty-four feet above the sidewalk and it was the aim of the sculptor to present Lincoln as
                    he appeared at the age of twenty-one, when his Indiana career just was coming to a close. Twenty
                    thousand people attended the dedicatory exercises. The principal address was delivered by the Hon.
                    Arthur M. Hyde, Secretary of Agriculture. Other speakers were Ida M. Tarbell, Senator James E.
                    Watson, Reverend Joseph R. Sizoo, pastor of the church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> which Lincoln attended when President, Arthur F. Hall, president of the Lincoln Life
                    Insurance Company, Governor Harry G. Leslie, and the sculptor, Paul Man-ship.</p>
            <p>It was the aim of Manship to represent Lincoln, the young man, "as a dreamer and a poet
                    rather than as a railsplitter" These qualities were regarded as of more importance on
                    account of Lincoln's great accomplishments in later life. Had he not been a dreamer in his
                    youth and young manhood, he could not have performed in his mature years with such
                    "idealism and clarity". While these views dominated the thought of the artist, he
                    did not neglect other characteristics possessed by Lincoln at the end of his Hoosier period.
                    Interpreting the completed statue, Manship says: "Everyone has heard or read the stories of
                    Lincoln's youthful physical prowess, and so we have depicted Lincoln as the brawny youth
                    that he was. The ax tells the story of the railsplitting days. The book symbolizes his intellectual
                    qualities; and the dog reminds us of his exceptional love for animals as well as the greater feeling
                    of human sympathy and protectiveness. His clothes, I decided to <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-028-3-069"/>
                    make to represent Linsey-Woolsey homemade shirt, buckskin trousers, and boots."</p>
