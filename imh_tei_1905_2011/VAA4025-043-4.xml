            <p>Many persons now past, or approaching, the age of the three score and ten years traditionally
                    allotted to man and who grew up on the American frontier will assert that in the old days sickness
                    was quite rare. They seem to remember that in their youth they had no aches or pains but were always
                    strong and healthy and even declare that all other people in their home communities were the same.</p>
            <p>Such people must either be afflicted with acute amnesia or have what the late Professor Edward
                    Channing once referred to as "a constructive memory." While it is quite true that
                    the American pioneers were a vigorous and hardy breed partly because the weaklings did not live long
                    under the conditions of frontier life, they were, nevertheless, human animals and as such were
                    subject to most diseases and ailments which afflict people today plus some additional ones that were
                    the result of their manner of living and their lack of knowledge of the most elementary principles
                    of hygiene and sanitation.</p>
            <p>The practices herein described were as common in such states as Indiana, <placeName>

                    </placeName> states during a later period and prevailed to a considerable extent throughout the
                    rural districts of the entire <placeName>

                    </placeName> Valley down to the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, traces of them may still be
                    found in the more remote and backward communities of the southern and central portions of the <placeName>

            <p>In the pioneer West an entire family lived in a log cabin, sod house, dugout, or structure of rough
                    lumber usually consisting of not more than three rooms and often of one <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-043-4-010"/> or two. Even though the great majority of these frontiersmen
                    were comparatively young people, there were often three or four children and in some cases as many
                    as six or seven or even more. Such a small house meant crowded quarters for five to eight or nine
                    people. In winter it was cold and draughty and yet ventilation was often poor. The family slept two
                    or three in a bed with the windows tightly closed just as they had been throughout the day. It has
                    been said that "the air is pure in the country because country people always sleep with the
                    windows closed!" Certainly that was the custom in the frontier communities because in the
                    prairie region fuel was scarce and even in the wooded areas the pioneer found it easier to close the
                    windows than to chop more wood.</p>
            <p>Screens for the doors and windows were unknown and flies were a perpetual plague in summer by day and
                    in many places mosquitoes a great source of annoyance by night. A child was frequently given a leafy
                    branch and assigned the task of "minding flies off the table" when company was
                    present, but the guests usually felt that it was only courteous to assert that this was unnecessary
                    and that everyone should be expected to "mind his own flies." That disease germs
                    were frequently carried to food by flies was of course certain. A sheet of mosquito bar was
                    frequently spread over a cradle to keep flies off a sleeping baby but many were likely to find their
                    way beneath it. The same material was also used to prevent the entrance of mosquitoes, but few
                    householders had a sufficient quantity to cover all windows and a "smudge" was
                    sometimes kindled to discourage these pestiferous insects.</p>
            <p>The water for household use came, in most cases, from a near-by spring or stream or was drawn from a
                    shallow well. It was not always pure and in many instances must have been contaminated by the
                    presence of colon bacilli or other germs of disease. The whole family drank from a common cup,
                    gourd, or tin dipper, washed in a single pan, and dried their hands and faces on the same towel. The
                    crossroads store always had a shelf in the rear equipped with a pail of water with a tin cup hanging
                    on a near-by nail from which thirsty customers drank freely, undisturbed by any thought of the
                    unsanitary nature of such a practice. The country school had a single water pail to accommodate
                    thirty or forty youngsters who seemed to the teacher perpetually <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-043-4-011"/> thirsty. The little hotel or tavern had similar drinking arrangements and guests, after washing
                    their hands and faces in a common basin, dried them on a "roller towel," the more
                    fastidious ones rolling it up or down often in a vain effort to find a reasonably clean and dry
                    spot.</p>
            <p>Visitors to a home drank from the common dipper and used the same washbasin as did the family with
                    the hostess making no concession except to put out a clean towel. The small son of the household
                    filled a basin half full of water, and he and his little playmate alternately snorted into it a
                    couple of times, dabbling a little water on the more central portion of their faces, and sometimes
                    chanting the little couplet: "Wash together, Friends forever."</p>
            <p>Bathing facilities were extremely meager. In summer the settler and his sons swam in the creek or
                    pond, and in winter a washtub was filled with water every Saturday night and the children placed in
                    it by strong-arm methods and scrubbed within an inch of their lives. If water had to be hauled or
                    carried a long distance, the "rinse water" of the family washing was sometimes
                    saved until evening and the youngsters bathed in it before they were put to bed.</p>
            <p>Every family had a single comb and brush which was used by all of its members. Toothbrushes were
                    unknown unless a hackberry root with one end chewed sufficiently to form a small mop could be so
                    designated. It was dipped in salt and used to rub the teeth lightly or they might be polished a bit
                    with one corner of the towel. Some men carried a gold-plated toothpick, or one made of deer bone and
                    used it to remove particles of food from between the teeth after every meal. Chewing gum, commonly
                    called "wax" in the South, was scarce and a single chew was passed about from
                    mouth to mouth of three or four children sometimes for days.</p>
            <p>When a number of boys had assembled to play ball one hot Sunday afternoon at the edge of the Cross
                    Timbers of North <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, one of the four Dye brothers eagerly besought his younger brother to go to the nearest
                    well a quarter of a mile away and bring a pail of water for the benefit of the sweating, thirsty
                    players. "Now, Walter," he pleaded earnestly, "if you'll take
                    the bucket and bring us a bucket of nice cool water from Mr. Clark's well, I'll
                    let you chew the wax! <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> is chewin' it now but his hour is about up and it's my time to chew it next.
                    Now you do that, Walter, like a good <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-043-4-012"/> boy, and I'll
                    skip my turn and let you chew the wax!" Unable to resist the promise of such a reward,
                    Walter seized the water pail and started in a lope for Mr. Clark's well.</p>
            <p>It was not only in the home, school, store, or tavern, however, that such unsanitary practices
                    prevailed. The idea of individual cups to be used in partaking of the Lord's Supper, had
                    never entered the head of any churchgoer. When the time came for the sacrament, a glass of wine and
                    a cake of unleavened bread were placed on a tray and passed up and down the rows of benches on which
                    members of the congregation sat. Each held the bread with one hand while he broke off a fragment
                    with the other and put it into his mouth. He then took a sip from the glass. If the little church
                    boasted a cottage organ, the worshippers could at least get their disease germs to the strains of
                    soft music and in a spiritual atmosphere!</p>
            <p>Under such conditions, it is not strange that when any person acquired a communicable disease, it was
                    not only likely to be transmitted to all other members of the family but to sweep through the entire
                    community. Colds, flu, measles, mumps, whooping cough, scabies, sore eyes, and other contagious or
                    infectious diseases were very common among the American pioneers. Smallpox was usually regarded as
                    serious enough to demand the isolation of the patient though it too might occasionally reach
                    epidemic proportions. Venereal disease was uncommon among rural settlers but by no means unknown,
                    and tuberculosis must have taken a considerable toll of lives. Trachoma undoubtedly existed but was
                    not known by that name but as "granulated lids." The treatment of any of the
                    diseases named was, moreover, usually crude and quite unscientific.</p>
            <p>The food of the average pioneer settler was abundant and substantial and of a type calculated to
                    enable him to swing a heavy ax, hoe, or maul for hours but the character of the meals in most
                    frontier homes would be viewed with horror by the modern dietitian. They leaned heavily towards fats
                    and starches. Meat was plentiful but, except in the early years of the settlement of a region where
                    game was abundant, it was usually salt pork, bacon, or ham. Fresh meat was rare in summer or, in
                    fact at any other season except "hog killing time" in the late autumn, or upon
                    those occasions when a neighbor killed a beef. At sush times, <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-043-4-013"/>
                    children, who had subsisted largely on strong "side meat" for many months, ate
                    "not wisely but too well," often with disastrous results. Refrigeration and ice
                    were of course unknown and food frequently spoiled in warm weather. If the family had a spring
                    house, milk, butter, and other perishable foods were kept in it. Otherwise milk was strained into
                    large shallow stone "crocks" and placed on a table in the cellar, along with
                    butter wrapped in a wet cloth. A jug of buttermilk was often tied to the end of a long rope and
                    "hung in the well" in much the same fashion as was "the moss covered
                    bucket." Nearly every kitchen had a cupboard with sides made of wire screen or perforated
                    tin to allow a free circulation of air without admitting flies. Dishes and food were kept in this
                    cabinet which was commonly known as a "safe" but with a number of perpetually
                    hungry children about, the term was something of a misnomer so far as food was concerned.</p>
            <p>During the winter months there was a lamentable lack of fresh fruits and green vegetables. As a
                    result many impatient youngsters could not wait for fruit to ripen but often ate green apples or
                    watermelons. Even later when fruit was ripe they stuffed themselves to repletion with plums,
                    peaches, berries, and grapes, as well as green corn and various types of vegetables. The result was
                    often grave disturbance of the digestive system commonly referred to as "summer
                    complaint." Milk was abundant in some areas but very scarce in others where even small
                    children drank strong, black coffee.</p>
            <p>Knowledge of what constitutes a proper diet for young children was almost wholly lacking. Babes in
                    arms were fed mashed potatoes, cabbage, spinach, squash, pie, cake, and cookies. While so young that
                    they had only their natural food, they usually remained reasonably healthy, but once they began to
                    be fed such things as would tax the digestion of an adult laborer, it frequently became another
                    story. The type of solid food given to them was probably largely responsible for the widely
                    prevailing belief that the most dangerous period for every baby was "the second
                    summer." In the light of modern medical science it is not surprising that infant mortality
                    was shockingly high, but that any child lived to maturity. As a matter of fact while only the strong
                    and healthy survived, one who lived to the sixth or seventh <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-043-4-014"/>
                    year was likely not only to reach manhood or womanhood but to achieve a ripe old age.</p>
            <p>Since hospitals were unknown all babies were brought into the world in the primitive homes often
                    without the benefit of any further medical skill or attention than such as could be furnished by
                    some ancient midwife commonly known as a "granny woman." Under such circumstances
                    childbearing was a frightful ordeal accompanied by much suffering and grave danger. The cemeteries
                    scattered about the region that was frontier half a century or more ago have many grave stones
                    inscribed " mother and infant" which tell a tragic story.</p>
            <p>The manner of life of the pioneer settler was such that he and the members of his family suffered
                    many minor injuries as cuts, burns, bruises, and abrasions. The children cut their fingers or
                    stepped on nails, thorns, or bits of broken glass. They were stung by bees, wasps, or scorpions,
                    bitten by spiders, or occasionally by a snake, or developed boils and felons, or acquired stone
                    bruises. A foot was sometimes cut open by an ax. Children were hurt at play and there is the old
                    story of the small boy who came running in to tell his mother that: "Oscar got hit in the
                    back of the head by the ball and the bawl came out of his mouth!"</p>
            <p>Such injuries were usually of minor importance but there were some that were serious and proper
                    methods of treating them were seldom employed. Common baking soda was put on a sting or bite of an
                    insect while the turpentine bottle was to be found in every household and was brought out upon
                    numerous occasions. Turpentine was applied to bruises or aching joints and sometimes was mixed with
                    lard and rubbed on a sore throat or chest. Other common remedies for bruises, abrasions, or to
                    reduce swelling and inflammation were goose grease, mutton tallow, gizzard oil, or snake oil. Some
                    of these were mixed with turpentine or camphor to insure greater potency.</p>
            <p>In addition there were poultices of infinite variety. These were made of bread and milk, onions,
                    flaxseed, scraped beefsteak, hot salt, mustard, poke root, and a host of other substances. They were
                    applied to a boil or "felon" to "draw it to a head" or to any
                    wound, bruise, or sore spot. Mustard plasters were designed to relieve a soreness in the chest. A
                    small chicken was split in halves and one-half of the warm, <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-043-4-015"/>
                    quivering flesh applied to a spider bite to "draw out the poison." A snake bite
                    was usually treated by administering a stiff drink of whisky and cutting the wound to make it bleed
                    freely. It was then sometimes cauterized with a hot iron or by pouring a little gunpowder on it
                    which was then ignited with a match or flaming splinter. If a child were bitten on the foot, the
                    entire member was sometimes placed in a pail filled with kerosene.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to these home remedies, there were various types of liniments and salves purchased at the
                    local drug store. These were of great variety and included many preparations known by the name of
                    their manufacturer and recommended as "good for man or beast and a sure cure for aches,
                    pains, cuts, bruises, old sores, or burns." Also there were eye salves, eye water,
                    "red precipity," used as a cure for itch, arnica salve, and ointments of many
                        kinds.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Axle grease or tar was sometimes applied to cracked hands, and

                            were employed to visit and interview old Indians and early pioneer white settlers and to

                    <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-043-4-016"/> Rumors that a rabid dog had appeared in the community created
                    intensive excitement and were carried by the "grapevine telegraph" to everyone in
                    the neighborhood. The men promptly armed themselves with rifles and shotguns loaded with buckshot
                    and tramped the fields and woods in search of the animal, their steps guided by reports of its
                    having been seen at various places in the community. Most of the searchers declared that they would
                    be less alarmed by the knowledge that a ferocious lion was loose in the neighborhood. In the
                    meantime, the women remained close at home and tried to keep the children indoors, regaling one
                    another with horrid tales of someone of whom they had once heard who had been bitten and some days
                    later had gone raving mad. The victim was alleged to have had convulsions, accompanied by foaming at
                    the mouth and an insane desire to bite anyone who came near. In his lucid moments, he was said to
                    have earnestly begged to be put out of his misery but nobody caring to accommodate him, the
                    unfortunate person had suffered frightfully for two or three days and at last died in great agony.
                    The popeyed children who listened to such frightful stories were usually not difficult to keep
                    inside the house. Few of them could have been induced to step outside even for a moment</p>
            <p>When the animal had at last been tracked down and dispatched, the entire community heaved a sigh of
                    relief. Even then, however, the incident was not closed. There still remained the task of
                    slaughtering all dogs that had been bitten or that were even suspected of having been bitten. In
                    consequence faithful old Rover was likely to be sent to the happy hunting ground by a charge of
                    buckshot, secretly if possible to avoid the tears and lamentations of the younger members of the
                    household.</p>
            <p>If by chance some person had been bitten by the rabid animal, which was seldom the case, he was
                    immediately rushed to a "madstone" if one could be found in a radius of twenty or
                    thirty miles. The stone which was said to have been taken from the body of a white deer was applied
                    to the wound and if it refused to stick, it meant that there was no poison in the wound and so no
                    cause for worry. On the other hand, if it stuck, there was no doubt but that the deadly germs of
                    hydrophobia were present. When the faithful mad-stone had decided to call it a day and refused to
                    cling longer <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-043-4-017"/> to the wound despite repeated applications, it was
                    regarded as <hi rend="i">prima facie</hi> evidence that a complete cure had been effected. The
                    madstone was then placed in a bowl of sweet milk and luried stories were related of how the milk
                    curdled and became green in color from the poison that it had drawn from the wound. In any case, the
                    patient felt safe and returned home relieved of any further concern.</p>
            <p>Other animals than dogs were alleged to have hydrophobia in some instances and there were
                    hair-raising stories of experiences with rabid wolves and "hydrophobia cows."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The bite of the small striped skunk, sometimes known as a
                    "hydrophobia cat," was alleged always to produce hydrophobia. They were dreaded
                    even more than rattlesnakes and any person bitten by one must rush to a madstone immediately. If
                    such a cure was not available, it was commonly believed that he might as well make his will, arrange
                    his world affairs, and, in the words of the old story, start making a preferential list of those he
                    expected to bite when he became mad!</p>
            <p>The superstition with respect to the madstone was common on the frontier but was only one of many
                    that related to the prevention or cure of ailments. A man sometimes carried a buckeye in his pocket
                    to ward off rheumatism. A mole's foot was attached to a string and tied about a
                    baby's neck to make cutting teeth easier. Also a small bag of asafetida was worn on a
                    string around the neck of a child to keep away disease germs. Probably there was some justification
                    for this practice since no one cared to go close enough to a child so equipped to transmit any germs
                    to him! The same reasoning may have been responsible for the idea that eating large quantities of
                    onions would prevent taking a cold.</p>
            <p>On the frontier the use of internal medicine was quite as prevalent as was the application of salves,
                    ointments, liniments, and plasters to relieve pain or heal minor injuries. There were some attempts
                    to practice preventive medicine, though most of the many concoctions taken to ward off disease
                    apparently had little or no value. In the early months of spring children were given a mixture of
                    sulphur, molasses, and cream of tartar to purify the blood. Also they were dosed <list type="footnotes">

                    face the heat of summer. Tonics were of infinite variety. A quart of whisky would be put into a jug
                    and some wild cherry bark, prickly ash berries, and sarsaparilla roots added, and the mixture
                    allowed to stand for several days or until the medicinal properties of the various other elements
                    had become merged with the whisky. A swallow of this taken night and morning was said to prevent
                    malaria, tone up the system, and improve the appetite. Other forms of bitters were made of a brew of
                    sarsaparilla roots, bitter apple, and various additional roots and herbs in order to stimulate the
                    appetite and improve digestion. Rusty nails were put into a bottle of water and a sip of the liquid
                    taken every day to insure plenty of iron in the blood.</p>
            <p>As already suggested, digestive disturbances due to improper food or excessive eating were very
                    common especially among children. A tea made of boiling the roots of a plant known as "red
                    root," which grew abundantly in the Southwest, was often given as a remedy for diarrhea,
                    dysentery, or "summer complaint." In fact "teas" were of as wide
                    variety as poultices. In addition to those already named there were sage tea, pennyroyal tea, ginger
                    tea, sarsaparilla tea, beef tea, rhubarb tea, horehound tea, and teas made from blackberry roots,
                    oak bark, or sheep droppings. They were ladled out to children not only for digestive disorders, but
                    also for colds, fever, or general "puniness" and a "run down
                    condition." Commercial tea called "store tea" was widely used in some
                    parts of the North as a beverage but on the southern frontier it seldom appeared except in cases of
                    sickness. The same was true of lemons, rice, and oranges which in many pioneer communities were
                    seldom purchased unless some member of the household was ill.</p>
            <p>On the frontier, as today, children attacked by colic due to overloading the stomach with more or
                    less indigestible foods were liberally dosed with castor oil. Appendicitis must have been fairly
                    common but the name was unknown and it was commonly called "inflammation of the
                    bowels." Typhoid fever, usually known as "slow fever," was also prevalent
                    in most cases being acquired from drinking contaminated water from shallow wells. It was treated by
                    giving the patient calomel or "blue mass" and sometimes quinine and limiting his
                    diet to soup and soft foods.</p>
            <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-043-4-019"/>
            <p>In winter coughs, colds, bronchitis, sore throat, and pleurisy were widespread and pneumonia was by
                    no means uncommon. Every person had his own remedy for a cold which is not too different from the
                    situation today. Soaking the patient's feet in hot water and requiring him to drink a hot
                    lemonade or a large cup of hot ginger tea before going to bed was almost universally regarded as the
                    proper treatment. The masculine members of a household usually regarded a "hot whisky
                    stew" as more effective than either the lemonade or ginger tea but in any case the patient
                    must retire immediately and be covered with heavy blankets so that he might perspire profusely and
                    so "sweat the cold out of his system." A favorite remedy for coughs and colds was
                    whisky in which had been dissolved a considerable quantity of rock candy. In addition there were
                    cough syrups of various types but the most common was made by making a strong tea of horehound
                    leaves, adding sugar and boiling it until a thick syrup was formed. A teaspoonful of this three or
                    four times a day was regarded as a sure cure for a cough.</p>
            <p>Malaria was common on nearly every part of the frontier except the high arid plains. This is not
                    surprising with no screens on the doors and windows of the homes which were often near a stream or
                    pond that produced myriads of mosquitoes. The cause of malaria, commonly called "chills and
                    fever," was, however, quite unknown. Some asserted that "chills" were due
                    to eating green watermelons, excessive swimming in the creek, or merely to "being out in
                    the night air." Just what air you were expected to be out in after dark if not
                    "night air" nobody took the trouble to explain. The term malaria obviously means
                    "bad air" but tradition rather than the word was responsible for the
                    pioneer's fear. The remedy was quinine but since gelatine capsules had not yet been
                    invented, it was hard to get it down the youngsters. Sometimes it was dissolved in coffee, or more
                    often wrapped in a piece of soft stewed fruit and gulped down with the hope that the wrapping did
                    not slip while it was still in the mouth. Often a quantity would be added to a quart of whisky and
                    the mixture shaken up and a swallow taken night and morning in chill season as "preventive
                    medicine."</p>
            <p>In some sections of the Southern frontier chills were accepted almost as an inevitable part of life
                    and the man who was virtually "shaking the bark off the trees" with a chill <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-043-4-020"/> in the late afternoon would be going about his work the
                    following morning singing, whistling, and apparently in the best of health and spirits. In fact one
                    individual, with that trend toward exaggeration characteristic of most pioneers, declared that in
                    his community a man who did not have a chill every other day and an addition to his family every
                    year would hurry to a doctor to find out what was wrong with him!</p>
            <p>In addition to quinine, there were on the market numerous "chill tonics" some
                    alleged to be "tasteless" which was usually another example of exaggeration. As a
                    matter of fact, the average pioneer settler, in addition to the use of home remedies spent an
                    astonishingly large percentage of his meager income for medicines both for external and internal
                    use. The local drug store sold huge quantities of "liver regulator,"
                    "black draught," liver pills, or "bile beans" all advertised as
                    a sure cure for "biliousness." Of the so-called "patent
                    medicines" there was an infinite variety, some of which are still sold. They included <hi rend="i">Peruna; Swamp Root', Golden Medical Discovery; Vegetable Compound', Stomach Bitters;
                        Wine of Cardui; Beef, Iron and Wine; Ozomulsion,</hi> and a host of others. Some were
                    recommended for a single disease while others were real "omnibus remedies" alleged
                    to be a sure cure for any or all of a dozen ailments. For infants and young children there was a
                    wide assortment of soothing syrups, cordials, and of course, paregoric, and Castoria.</p>
            <p>Makers of patent medicines advertised their wares widely in the weekly papers and especially in the
                    monthly or semi-monthly household journals. Such advertisments sometimes showed the picture of a
                    dejected-looking individual labeled "before taking" and a stalwart physical
                    specimen tagged "after taking." Testimonials from grateful users of the remedy
                    were often printed as: "I was run down and life was a burden but after taking only five
                    bottles of your wonderful medicine, I am now entirely recovered."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    Occasionally an advertisement writer essayed verse asserting that:</p>

                    probably agree that the statement was correct. Another widely circulated bit of blank verse designed
                    to promote the sale of a popular child remedy was as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            she became Miss, she clung to Castoria When she had Children, she gave them Castoria.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> The constant repetition of the name could hardly fail to impress it upon the reader and fix
                    in his mind the perennial value of the medicine though on one occasion an over particular Victorian
                    was heard to remark that some mention of a change in "Baby's" marital
                    status should have been indicated prior to the last line!</p>
            <p>Other makers of patent medicines also essayed verse in bringing their wares to the attention of the
                    ailing public as the following:<quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>There is some evidence that manufacturers of so-called "patent medicines" made an
                    earnest and concerted effort in the eighties and nineties to induce people to substitute such
                    preparations for the old time home remedies of earlier years. Certainly the volume of advertising
                    increased enormously no doubt in part due to the fact that the number of newspaper readers grew
                    rapidly as many additional periodicals were established and the older ones greatly increased their
                    circulation. Makers of numerous proprietary medicines in virtually all of these local newspapers so
                    almost any one of them is typical of a hundred others all of which carried the same advertising

            <p>Most manufacturers of the patent medicines most widely distributed realized that a large part of the
                    frontier population did not in their own language "take a paper." This was
                    especially true of the less literate people to whom the purveyors of such preparations looked for a
                    large part of their customers. In consequence, many such manufacturers published an almanac for
                    distribution through the mails or local drug stores. These were of the type of the old <hi rend="i">Farmer's Almanac</hi> established in 1793 by Robert B. Thomas and published in recent

                    miscellaneous material including household hints, weather forecasts, recipes, advice to farmers, and
                    jokes and anecdotes. On every page, however, the virtures of the remedy were proclaimed in type that
                    could hardly fail to catch the reader's eye. Advertising was yet in its infancy and modern
                    techniques of making the product offered only incidental to the picture of a dizzy blonde in
                    abbreviated costume had not been discovered. The cover of the almanac carried a picture but it was
                    always one designed to fix the attention of the reader upon the remedy. Sometimes it depicted St.
                    George plainly labeled as the medicine, slaying the dragon of disease. Among the pioneers the belief
                    was common that the Indians had much medical lore especially with respect to the curative properties
                    of certain roots and herbs. The cover of one popular almanac pictured an Indian woman pointing to a
                    growing plant and exclaiming to her white sister bowed down with suffering, "The Great
                    Spirit planted it!"</p>
            <p>Doctors, except in the towns, were few and far between and most of them had little to recommend them
                    except imposing whiskers and an impressive bedside manner. Yet they made up for their lack of
                    medical skill and scientific knowledge by an enormous energy and conscientious devotion to duty. In
                    sub-zero weather, often through sleet and snow, they traveled many miles in open buggies or on
                    horseback to relieve suffering and minister to those in need of help. They brought to many a
                    household comfort and hope and uncomplainingly made enormous sacrifices and endured frightful
                    hardships to give their poor best to suffering humanity. To them the people of America owe a heavy
                    debt of gratitude.</p>
            <p>This scarcity of physicians was obviously responsible for the rapid increase in the sale of
                    proprietary remedies or "mail order" medical treatment. It was also responsible
                    for the early appearance of the traveling doctor with his "medicine show," an
                    institution which was continued well down into the twentieth century. Usually he was a somewhat
                    corpulent individual in striped trousers, a Prince Albert coat, white shirt, and black string tie
                    who appeared on the streets of a western village just after sundown in a large flat truck drawn by
                    two white horses with silver mounted harness. Sitting in chairs on the truck were two or three
                    black-faced comedians vigorously playing a violin and a banjo, <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-043-4-025"/>
                    guitar, or accordion. Stopping at the most prominent street corner, these black-faced boys would
                    burst into song and continue until a considerable crowd had gathered. Then the
                    "Doctor" would stand and in a deep, sonorous voice begin his speech:</p>
            <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen: I am traveling about over the country trying to bring aid to
                    suffering humanity. We have not come out here this evening to try to sell you anything but only that
                    we may all have a good time–" "Yum, yum," would interpose one
                    of the comedians, "Ain't we a-gwine hab a <hi rend="i">good timel"</hi>
                    "Shut up, Sam," the doctor would exclaim. "Now, folks, we are not
                    interested in making money or selling you something but only in helping you to feel better and in
                    curing any ailments you may have. I look at you men standing there and I can see that some of you
                    have a dull ache in the back, and twinges of pain in your shoulders and legs." The villager
                    who had worked at a forge all day sharpening plows, or shoeing horses, and the farmers who had hoed
                    corn since sunrise and then dropped over to town to do an errand would look at one another and nod
                    knowingly. It took no great stretch of imagination to make them feel the dull aches and twinges so
                    aptly described by the wise doctor. Having planted the seed, the doctor proceeded to cultivate the
                    crop certain of a reasonably bountiful harvest. "Now, men," he would continue,
                    "In my laboratories at home I've worked for years hoping to find a preparation
                    that would cure cases just like yours and at last I found it. Here it is, gentlemen, Dr.
                    X's Marvelous Elixir. Take one tablespoon-ful and that dull ache will vanish as if by magic
                    and if you'll take a dose night and morning for three weeks, I'll guarantee that
                    it will never come back. You'll have a better appetite, feel better than ever before in
                    your life, and be able to do a full day's work without that run-down, wornout feeling you
                    now have. Only a dollar a bottle for anybody that wants one and you'll say it's
                    the biggest dollar's worth you ever saw in your lives. Step right up, gentlemen,
                    who'll be first?"</p>
            <p>After one or two had stepped forward and rather sheepishly tendered a dollar, the contagion grew and
                    there was likely to be a rush to exchange dollars for bottles of the Elixir. When sales began to
                    fall off, a brief recess was held and the black-face boys played again and sang more songs while
                    others joined the little crowd. Then sales were resumed <pb n="324" id="VAA4025-043-4-026"/> and
                    continued until all customers had been supplied after which one of the boys mounted to the
                    driver's seat and, with the others gaily singing and playing, the truck was driven to the
                    camping place that had been selected just beyond the edge of town27</p>
            <p>There were of course many variations. Some proprietors of medicine shows dispensed several remedies
                    including liniments, salves, an "inhaler" for catarrh and colds in the head, or
                    soap "made from the roots of the Mexican yucca." There were also traveling
                    "corn doctors" who usually displayed a large box of corns and calluses taken from
                    the feet of former customers. It is doubtful if the preparations sold by these itinerant shows had
                    any curative effects but they at least gave to those who "enjoyed poor health" a
                    new remedy to try and the entertainment features brought a little color and excitement to drab and
                    monotonous lives.</p>
            <p>Dentists were even more rare on the frontier than were general practitioners, though one or two could
                    usually be found at the more important towns. They advertised extensively in the local newspapers
                    offering their services at prices that would shock present day members of the profession.
                    "A fine set of false teeth" was offered for eight dollars and teeth would be
                    extracted "without pain" at twenty-five cents each.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Outside
                    the larger towns, however, people paid virtually no attention to their teeth unless one began to
                    ache. Then a hot poultice would be applied to the jaw or a cavity stuffed with a bit of cotton
                    soaked in laudanum or some form of "toothache drops." The loose milk tooth of a
                    child was pulled by the father or mother with the fingers or yanked out by looping a bit of thread
                    about it and giving a quick jerk or tying one end of the thread to the open door and suddenly
                    closing it. The youngster was always told that if he did not put his tongue into the vacant space a
                    gold tooth would grow there but never found it possible to test the truth of this assertion. If an
                    adult's aching tooth could not be eased by poultices or medicated cotton, it was sometimes
                    knocked out with a chisel or screwdriver and hammer, or pulled by means of a pair of bullet molds in
                    the hands of a husky neighbor.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>A traveling dentist equipped with a small case of tools of his craft would sometimes appear in a
                    community but he seldom did more than pull bad teeth and give some advice as to the care of those
                    left. When an individual had very few teeth left, eating became a serious problem but many managed
                    to struggle along with surprisingly few. There is an ancient story to the effect that one old lady
                    at an experience meeting expressed her thanks to the Lord that she still had "two teeth
                    left and they hit."</p>
            <p>When false teeth became absolutely necessary, a trip was made to the nearest dentist which sometimes
                    required a journey of two or three days. Once there, impressions were made and the patient returned
                    home to receive his teeth two or three weeks later by mail. Naturally they seldom fit well and were
                    usually worn in a pocket most of the time and placed in the mouth only when required for eating or
                    when visitors appeared.</p>
            <p>In addition to traveling doctors and dentists, spectacle salesmen also peddled their wares throughout
                    many frontier areas and persons with failing eyesight fitted themselves with glasses by the simple
                    method of trying on a number of pairs and choosing the one with which they could see best. There is
                    an old story to the effect that one such salesman stopped at a country store in the Ozark Mountain
                    region on a Saturday afternoon and, observing that nearly every man of the considerable number of
                    loafers assembled there had a red mark across the bridge of his nose, was very hopeful of doing a
                    big business. To his disappointment, however, he was solemnly informed that none of these men had
                    ever worn glasses but had acquired these marks in drinking corn whisky out of a fruit jar!</p>
            <p>While physicians and dentists were very few on the frontier, it was usually possible to obtain the
                    services of either if the emergency were sufficiently grave but often only after considerable delay.
                    Trained nurses, however, were unknown. Sometimes there might be found in a community a woman who
                    would care for sick people for hire but this was unusual. Such a woman would today be called a
                    "practical nurse" but it must be admitted that if one of these could be found on
                    the frontier, she was as a rule, to paraphrase Voltaire, "neither practical nor a
                    nurse." At best she was only a person with considerable experience in the sick room <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-043-4-028"/> who was willing to come into a home and work on a twenty-four
                    hour shift for the duration of the emergency getting what sleep or recreation she could when
                    relieved by relatives or friends of the patient.</p>
            <p>Of professional nursing, however, there was virtually none. A sick person was cared for by members of
                    his family and kindly neighbors who were always ready and willing to lend assistance.
                    "Sitting up with the sick," was regarded as the plain duty of everyone if the need
                    arose and some persons achieved a local reputation as humanitarians by virtue of being "so
                    good to wait on the sick." If anyone in the community became seriously ill, it was expected
                    that his family would notify the neighbors, and any failure to do so was regarded almost as an
                    affront. It was only necessary to pass on the word of illness in a family to a very few. The
                    grapevine functioned with amazing efficiency and kindly persons hastened to call to bring special
                    dainties to tempt the patient's appetite and to offer their services to "sit
                    up" or to aid in any other possible fashion. Usually two or three would come in each
                    evening and do some quiet visiting as they watched from an adjoining room. During the day there were
                    likely to be many visitors to inquire about the situation and to sit and talk with the patient
                    unless the latter were so ill that it was deemed inadvisable to admit any
                    "company" to the sick room.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed that an occasional visitor to the sick might be characterized as a
                    "Job's comforter" whose influence was far from salutary. Such a person
                    would come in on tiptoe, seat himself by the bed, and after a long survey of the patient would shake
                    his head sorrowfully and remark: "You must be pretty bad, Bill; I don't like your
                    color. You look a lot like my uncle Joe did just before he passed on." If the patient
                    protested that he felt much better than he had the day before, the visitor would again shake his
                    head and continue: "Yes, Uncle Joe did, too. He rallied a little right at the last and then
                    all at once went out just like a light." By the time the pessimistic individual had at last
                    departed, the patient was likely to be in a cold sweat of fear and to feel that at any minute he
                    might begin "picking at the cover," which among pioneer peoples was regarded as a
                    sure sign of impending death.</p>
            <pb n="327" id="VAA4025-043-4-029"/>
            <p>Fortunately such gloomy visitors were very few. Most persons who came to call upon the sick brought
                    not only food and flowers, and help to the overburdened family but something even more
                    important–cheerfulness and sunshine and a breath of the pure air of the world outside.
                    Among a people who lacked all modern facilities for the care of the suffering the kindly helpfulness
                    of friends and neighbors robbed illness of much of its terror for the patient and his family alike.
                    Many a person at last rose from a sick bed with a heart filled with gratitude for many favors and a
                    spirit humbled and chastened by the knowledge that so many whom he had formerly regarded with
                    indifference had, in his hour of need, proved themselves true and devoted friends. Undoubtedly
                    illness often served to strengthen the bonds of friendship and helped to promote that neighborly
                    feeling and community consciousness so characteristic of the American pioneers.</p>
            <p>With the passing of the years, the old frontier days and ways began to disappear. Manners and customs
                    were changing and this was as apparent in medical practices as in everything else. The coming of
                    railroads brought in a larger population, towns grew up, and with economic advancement more
                    physicians came in to open offices and begin a medical practice. They were, moreover, men of far
                    more training and skill, in most cases, than had been the old-time frontier doctors. Hospitals
                    supplied with modern e quipment were established. Graduate nurses became available. The old home
                    remedies gave way to the prescriptions of physicians and even the rage for patent medicines began to
                    abate as scientific investigations were made proving many of them worthless. Some standard remedies
                    are still sold but many preparations disappeared from the market and the sale of others was far less
                    than formerly, though weekly and daily newspapers still advertise some proprietary medicines. New
                    remedies appeared on the shelves of the pharmacies and new treatments of disease were evolved. In
                    addition many of the ailments that had formerly afflicted the pioneers have largely disappeared.</p>
            <p>Only in a few backward communities do the old medical practices still persist in the nature of
                    "fossil remains" of customs that half a century or more ago were virtually
                    universal, at least in the rural districts of most states west of <pb n="328" id="VAA4025-043-4-030"/> the <placeName>

                    practices of the American people in the West during the past three-quarters of a century and of how
                    they have changed would undoubtedly produce a worthwhile contribution to the field of social
                    history.</p>

                    </placeName>–a promise which was incapable of immediate fulfillment. Then ensued a
                    readjustment of economic and political life, inevitable after a prolonged war. During the postwar
                    depression, economic conditions, particularly agricultural ones, became increasingly worse.
                    "Tenants could not pay their rents; landlords were straightened; farmers who had taken
                    leases, under high prices of grain, were losing money by wholesale. Laborers' wages were diminished;
                    some were wholly unemployed, and many had to receive parochial relief. The poor rates increased
                    another tax on the already-embarrassed farmer."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    </placeName> on account of the reactionary Tory political control, many farmers and farm laborers
                    began to look for a country to which they might emigrate. John McGregor wrote that the causes of
                    emigration were "chiefly poverty, dissatisfaction in respect to public measures, or
                    ambition." Elaborating farther, he suggested that the "majority of those who
                    emigrate to America, are driven abroad by the goadings of poverty; another class is formed of
                    adventurous men, who go to seek fortunes… ; a third class is composed of men of
                    genius…whose hopes have been blighted at home; and a fourth class includes individuals

                        recorded his first meeting with the prairie flies at this time. He noted the
                        "refractory" actions of the horses. "The flies attack both horses and
                        cattle, and sting them dreadfully in the open prairie, but will not follow them into the
                        ordinary shade of a wood or forest. They rarely, if ever, attack men. This annoyance induces
                        travelers, crossing large prairies, to travel by night and rest by day." Birkbeck

                        through a simple process, easy to perform, and profitable as it goes on. Thus no addition,
                        except the above on the score of improvement, is to be made to the first cost, as regards the
                        land. Buildings, proportioned to the owner's inclination or purse, are of course
                        requisite on every estate.</p>

                            Calculations on the capital to be employed on buildings, and stock alive and dead, would be
                            futile, as this would be in proportion to the means. The larger the amount, within the

                    projected settlement. Jefferson answered in a letter from Poplar Forest dated July 12, 1817. He
                    noted that the general law prescribed an open sale; to dispense land by special legislation was
                    generally opposed, "lest a principle of favoritism should creep in and prevent that of
                    equal rights." He also indicated that he had little influence with the administrators of
                    the land office, for during the last "eight or ten years" all its personnel had
                    changed. He commended Flower's decision to remain in America as an action demonstrating to

                        <p>To commence operations by building a number of cabins with enclosures of two acres and a-half
                            each, along the sides of a section, which is to be reserved as their cow pasture. These
                            cottages, and inclosures, with a well between two, may be rented by persons who will resort
                            to us for the sake of good earnings. ... It is the intention of my friend, Mr. Flower, and
                            myself to purchase … one, or more, entire townships in the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                            </placeName> territory. … These lands, we propose to offer (on terms
                            proportionably favourable) to a number of our countrymen, whose views may so far accord with
                            our own, as to render proximity of settlement desirable. … With regard to the
                            disposal of the lands in general, we shall probably, offer them in sections, half-sections,
                            quarters, and eighths. …</p>
                        <p>We wish it to be clearly understood, that we have no design of forming a society of English,
                            to be governed by any laws or regulations of our own framing. We would not bind others, nor
                            be ourselves bound by any ties, but those of mutual interest, and good neighbourhood; nor be
                            subject to any law, but the law of the land.</p>
                    </quote> One stipulation would be made–</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>That no person may be tempted, by the low price at which our lands shall be offered to <hi rend="i">possess</hi> themselves of it as a mere object of speculation, a declaration will
                        be required on the part of the purchaser, of his intention to reside on the spot. We would, at
                        the same time, impress upon him, the necessity of not purchasing more than he can fairly manage.
                        Our opinion is, that it would be more advantageous to the resident proprietor to possess a
                        capital of four or five pounds sterling an acre, than to incapacitate himself for carrying on
                        his improvements for want of adequate means.</p>
                    <p>I repeat that we have not fallen on this scheme from a wish to form a society exclusively
                        English, or, indeed, <hi rend="i">any</hi> society as distinct from the people at large. We
                        would most willingly extend our proposals to Americans or emigrants of any nation, with the
                        requisite capital, could our plan embrace them. Concentration of capital and numbers is the only
                        refuge from many privations, and even sufferings in these remote regions:–but, the
                        main advantage of preparing, as we propose, for the reception of our brethren, will be to save
                        them a wearisome and expensive travel, in quest of a settlement, but too often ending in
                        despair. …<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

                    concerning them; markets would be excellent because of river communications with the ocean.
                    Illness? English people seemed liable to bilious attacks upon their arrival, but it was
                    easily overcome. Objects of immediate attention for manufacture were beer, spirits, pottery,
                    tanning. The minerals of the vicinity were not known. In the second book, Birkbeck reported the
                    presence of excellent limestone; there was coal, but wood remained the cheapest fuel. Implements
                    were cheap with the exception of iron. Roads were still in a state of nature.</p>

                    He also indicated that Birkbeck had "somewhat changed. He looked older, was rather testy,
                    and occasionally gave short answers"; Fordham's information surprised Flower. His
                    cousin had built two cabins on Flower's land; in one was living a French-Canadian family.
                    The family group went to the second cabin. The nearest well was beside the other cabin Fordham had

                    Birkbeck rise and move toward the cabin. Shaking his head, he said, "No, we can not meet, I
                    can not see you." Astonished, Flower replied, "We must meet, our property is
                    undivided, business is urgent. ..." "Stop," said he, "let a
                    third person arrange all." "So be it," answered Flower and rode away.

                        promising to prepare houses and purchase land for them and the family before they returned.
                        … When the Flower family arrived, he had done nothing, nor purchased anything for
                        them." Faux gave a recital of the final interview; he recounted the subsequent illness
                        of the Flowers. An infant daughter died; and "Mr. [Richard] Flower's favorite
                        son, thus exposed and sick, never recovered." Birkbeck wrote to Richard Flower in

                        since he had not bought them any land, but had returned their funds to their Eastern banker.
                        This determined Richard Flower to come to the prairies to protect his family. "They

                        several carpenters, bricklayers, brickmakers, smiths, wheelwrights, and sawyers; also a taylor
                        and butcher.</p>
                    <p>A horse <hi rend="i">or</hi> ox mill is building, a malt house planned out, and a new brick
                        building for a tavern, and several new houses begun. As water is scarce, there are some more
                        wells digging. Mr. Birkbeck, in July, found a tolerable good spring, by digging only six feet,
                        about 300 yards from his house; but several of the wells lately dug have but little water in
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Birkbeck's house is situated south of the village, a frame and log building of good
                        size; it stands pleasantly, and commands a fine view of the prairie.</p>
                    <p>The building lots, at Wanborough, are some of five, and others of two and a half acres, laid out,
                        like imost of the American towns, in streets that cross each other at right angles, running
                        north and south; the cross ones east and west. The lots are in the woods, but a considerable
                        quantity of the wood is now cleared.</p>
                    <p>Albion, Mr. Flower's settlement, lies two miles east of Wanborough; it is also situated
                        in the woods, a little north of the English <placeName>

                        stores, a surgeon, several carpenters, brick-makers, bricklayers, wheelwrights, smiths, sawyers,
                        and a shoemaker. Several wells have lately been dug in and near it, but water is still scarce.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Flower's house is to the south-east of Albion, a large log-building, well placed to
                        enjoy the prospect of the prairie.</p>
                    <p>Many cabins are built round the prairies, but mostly just in the woods. The English that do not
                        reside in the two villages, are scattered round the different prairies, mostly in single cabins.
                        About four miles to the east of Albion, at Bonpas-bridge, there is a saw-mill lately built, but
                        it is not yet got to work, having had the mill-dam carried away by a flood in February.

                    <p>What appeared to me to be one of the great drawbacks to settling at Albion, was, that there were
                        two parties who were in open hostility with one another, and whose eternal prosecutions enabled
                        two lawyers, even in this small settlement, to thrive upon the dissensions of the community. Mr.
                        Flowers was the person against whom the greatest indignation of the opposite party was pointed,
                        but, although I was at the time informed of their mutual grievances, yet I have since so
                        entirely forgotten them that I cannot take upon me to say which party was in the right. I must
                        confess, however, that I was greatly mortified at seeing these foolish people, after having left
                        their country, crossed the Atlantic, and travelled 1000 miles into the wilderness, quarrelling
                        with one another, and making each other's situation as disagreeable as possible. The
                        hostile parties do not even speak; and thus the respectable inhabitants, who might constitute a

                        none of their virtues–drinking, fighting, &amp;c, and, when fighting

            <p>In June, 1825, Morris Birkbeck and his son Bradford journeyed to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and on the return trip began the crossing of the <geogName>Fox River</geogName>. Morris
                    Birkbeck was drowned in the attempt; his body was recovered and buried at <placeName>

            <p>Another issue which drew the "hostile parties" together in their actions, if not in

            <p>In attempting an evaluation of the success of the experiment undertaken by Morris Birkbeck and George
                    Flower, its purposes must be considered. Birkbeck had said their purpose was not to form a society

            <p>George Flower reasoned that the Settlement had succeeded because large-scale speculation had been
                    prevented. The small farmer was enabled to buy land reasonably as the founders had intended. He
                    maintained that the prairies were better suited to English farmers than forest areas. There was also
                    "a happy proportion among the settlers of men of money, men of intelligence, and men of
                        toil."<hi rend="sup">95</hi> Many of the first settlers became independent farmers;
                    their children received a good inheritance. As Birkbeck had hoped, they were no different from the
                    people at large.</p>
            <p>A contemporary traveler, William Blane, commented judiciously upon the Settlement. "While at
                    Albion I read all the books and reviews that had been written both for and against this settlement.
                    One traveller describes it as an earthly paradise, another as a miserable unhealthy swamp; the truth

                        arrange for the purchase of some sixteen thousand acres of public land in what was known as

                        </placeName>. One year later, Birkbeck brought his four children to his purchase, and Flower

                        his emigration by Birkbeck. It must be questioned whether Flower was "sent" in
                        1816 upon such a mission; certainly there was no "purchase" to which Birkbeck
                        brought his family. Is 1819 intended as the date of arrival of Birkbeck in <placeName>

                        laid out a village which he called Albion." The only antecedent for the pronoun is
                        Birkbeck, who had nothing to do with the founding of Albion. On page x are the following
                        sentences: "George Flower, in 1818, brought over his father and several members of his
                        family, having previously married a ward of Birkbeck .… Upon arriving at Albion he
                        began the construction of a residence which he called ‘Park
                        House.’" Miss Andrews was never Birkbeck's ward. How could Flower
                        arrive at Albion, a town which he and others founded <hi rend="i">after</hi> his
                        arrival? Finally, on page xi one may read: "The failure of the English

                        writers, Sparks listed "Vaux, Woods, and other travellers. …"It may
                        be assumed that William Faux was intended for "Vaux." "In 1825
                        Birbeck was drowned in crossing a stream while making a visit to Robert Owen at his community of
                        Harmony." When was the name changed to <placeName>

                        </placeName>? He was returning from the visit, moreover. "George Flower

            <p>Since the roads were better, the weather more favorable, and the food more plentiful in the autumn,
                    farmers were urged to move with their teams and wagons at this season of the year. The people who
                    lived south of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    camped out at night. Travel to the interior was less costly if made on horseback. The expenses for a
                    person using this means of transportation usually varied from seventy-five cents to one dollar per
                    day. The stage fare was six cents per mile and stage house meals could be had for thirty-seven and

                    than one animal was used. One could see the head of the family walking by the horse, while the wife
                    might be walking beside her husband or bringing up the rear, watching out for the children. The road

            <p>Citizens living along the East Fork of the Whitewater were determined to secure a canal of their own.
                    The <hi rend="i">Indiana American</hi> of August 5, 1836, tells of a meeting to be held the
                    following day to discuss the construction of an East Fork Canal.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> On September

                    </placeName> counties met at Dunlapsville to discuss the proposed canal. A survey was conducted in
                    1837, but bids were not let until 1839. The project was doomed to failure, however, and little
                    construction work was done.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            <p>It was hoped that the new canal would greatly increase the importance of the valley, and would
                    stimulate the rapid development of towns and cities. These aspirations were not destined to be fully

            <p>One of the outstanding developments in the field of religion during this period was the alignment of
                    the Quakers with the antislavery movement which was rising in the North. It has been previously
                    indicated that the Quakers were one of the strongest sects in the valley, and the best organized. In
                    1836 the Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends emphatically condemned colonization and gave their
                    sanction to unconditional emancipation.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> The yearly meetings in 1837 called its
                    members to action. "We would encourage all to a close examination as to what is required at
                    their hands, and how they may employ the talents committed to them for noble purposes in the
                    advancement of the blessed work of emancipation, by meekly, yet boldly, either publicly or privately
                    pleading the cause of the oppressed."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> A State Anti-Slavery Society of

            </p>
            <p>Although the Quakers resented the progress made by the Methodists in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName> , some improvement in the relations between the two sects was evident at the close of
                    the decade. When Joseph Tarkington, a Methodist minister, came to <placeName>

                    </placeName> families. That some friction still existed can be gained from the fact that very few
                    adults attended his services. "They could not think of listening to a paid minister, or

            <p>The Knights of the Golden Circle was a name that never failed to send the cold shivers down my spine
                    as a child. When my father would tell me the story, his own face would be covered with goose pimples
                    and I could scarcely breathe, although I had heard the story dozens of times.</p>
            <p>Years ago when my father was quite a small boy, one night after he had been sent to bed and was
                    supposed to be asleep, my grandmother happened to look toward the orchard which was at the rear of
                    the house. There she saw men apparently surrounding the house. Presently, there was a knock.
                    Grandmother opened the door and a man, with a mask covering most of his face, asked in a gruff voice
                    for "the doctor." Grandfather was quickly bundled up and satchels were put into a
                    small buggy. He was securely blindfolded and driven round and round for what he judged to be about
                    an hour. Finally, he was told to get out of the buggy. In an old barn on the straw were two men with
                    masks. One had a broken leg and the other a gun shot wound in the hip. After grandfather had taken
                    care of them, he was again blindfolded and driven home by the same circuitous route. He was
                    cautioned a number of times not to mention "this night's work" to a
                    living soul. Grandfather, however, was an observing person and could recognize his friends and many
                    of his patients by their hands as quickly as by their faces. It happened that he recognized the
                    hands of one of the men that he had attended. He never mentioned "this night's
                    work" except to the boys (his sons), even then he did not give the man's name. He
                    frequently said with a queer smile if the roll of membership of the Knights should ever be published
                    many people might be surprised.</p>
            <p>I received an old book <hi rend="i">The American Bastile</hi> and read the chapter on Colonel Lambdin
                    P. Milligan. This revived my interest. Then I re-read my mother's scrapbooks which included
                    clippings from old papers and contacted several friends of the family. One was a little blind

                    years. Another was Samuel E. Cook, judge of the circuit court. and once a partner of Milligan. He
                    told me that many people from all over the country had written him wanting to know more about the
                    man, but he never answered their letters. He volunteered, however, to tell me anything I wanted to
                    know.</p>
            <p>Inasmuch as the Milligan case was quite famous because of the decision given by the Supreme Court, it
                    is natural that we would want to know something of the character and background of the man. Lambdin
                    P. Milligan was of sturdy Irish ancestry, who came to this country with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> colony. His father, Moses Milligan, settled with his parents at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Brownsville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, in 1774. Later, his family accompanied a surveying party to
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, and afterwards he served with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Rangers. His grandfather, John Purdy, was a member of the Irish Grays called the
                    "Heavy Dragoons," a brave and fierce outfit whose members were required to be over
                    six feet in height. His mother, Mary Purdy, a Virginian, came from pioneer stock. She was in the
                    blockhouse at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Wheeling</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, when it was attacked by the Indians. Her brother
                    and his family were entirely wiped out in this massacre. Lambdin's father and mother both
                    attended the celebration of Independence at Fort Pitt, July 4, 1776. Shortly after his parents had
                    moved to Belmont, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Lambdin was born on March 24, 1812. He was the eighth child in a family of nine
                    children. His boyhood was spent on his father's farm where the trials and adventures of the
                    then frontier life had much to do with shaping his career. His father was a great reader and had a
                    good library for that day. At an early age, therefore, Lambdin formed a decided taste for good
                    reading. Although his opportunities were limited, he managed to get enough education to teach school
                    for a number of years. His father, proud of his attainments, promised to educate him for the medical
                    profession on condition "of good conduct and faithful labor." When the time
                    arrived, his mother objected saying, it was not fair to the other children to make a distinction in
                    their education. His father then offered to repay him in money and land, but Lambdin refused and
                    left home regardless of the wishes and the threats of his father.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. He passed the examination, at the head of a class of nine members, on October 27,
                    1835. In his class were Thomas West, George Shannon, and Edwin M. Stanton, later Secretary of War,
                    who was vitally connected with Milligan's later career.</p>
            <p>On the day of his admission to the practice of law in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Court, he married Sarah L. Ridgeway, who died on November 20,1870. There were three
                    sons born to this union, Moses, Lewis, and James. Milligan was a tall man six feet and four inches
                    in height with a light complexion and blue eyes. He was always neatly dressed and frequently
                    appeared in a frock coat and high hat. He was associated with the "Legal Lights"
                    of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> courts for ten years, and it was here that he became the Colonel of the National
                    Guards. He came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana, in 1845. His first home was on a farm near Monument City on the
                    Salamonie River, where he hoped to regain his health. For several years he had suffered much from
                    epilepsy and spinal meningitis which caused a partial paralysis of the lower limbs. He had
                    sufficiently recovered in 1860 and continued to practice law in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> counties. He rose rapidly to become one of the foremost lawyers in northern Indiana
                    comparing favorably with David H. Colerick, William H. Coombs, John U. Pettit, and Daniel Pratt and
                    was frequently associated with John R. Coffroth in the conduct of cases. As a lawyer he was earnest,
                    direct, logical, and clear, endeavoring to convince rather than please, but was much too frank to
                    have ever become a successful politician.</p>
            <p>He came to this county when it was practically a wilderness and sparsely settled. His close touch
                    with public affairs afforded him an acquaintance with all the people in the country. He identified
                    himself with the improvements of the new country. He was interested in the Liberty Mills Road, an
                    enthusiastic promoter of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Railroad, and he had been president and attorney for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Atlantic (now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName>) Railroad. He was interested in the work of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
                    </placeName> County Agricultural Society for a number of years and took pride in his farming and
                    stock raising. He was a lover of blooded horses and kept a stable of fine race horses. The outline
                    of his training track is still well defined at the rear of the estate. He was at one time deputy
                    clerk <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-043-4-084"/> and many of the records are found in his handwriting. He
                    was a member of the Catholic church and during his vigorous days a faithful attendant and supporter
                    of the church. In politics, he was always a Democrat and a student of the teachings of Jefferson and
                    Jackson. He was interested in national and local politics and took a firm stand against all
                    movements and combinations which he considered as opposing the general welfare</p>

                    Milligan. A rambling house, almost on the bank of the Little River. The thin limestone slabs of the
                    original structure are retained in what is now the kitchen. The front of the house is weatherboarded
                    with wide poplar boards still in good condition. Here he often entertained his friends, and it was
                    his particular delight to invite members of the bar or intimate friends to dine with him. He was a
                    splendid conversationalist, his reminiscences of events of his life and times, and the meetings with
                    Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and Andrew Jackson were regarded by his guests as an unusual pleasure. Judge Cook
                    recalled his last big dinner party given to the bar and mentioned the delicious young pig roasted
                    and served with the apple in its mouth. The Milligans were very hospitable, and it was not uncommon
                    for them to serve fifty people at their home on the days of a political rally.</p>
            <p>Milligan opposed with great energy every movement looking toward a collision between the North and
                    the South in 1861. He addressed numerous meetings at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and other cities in 1863 and 1864. He was of the opinion that the war had not been
                    begun to preserve the Union, but advocated a Union restored by negotiation rather than war and
                    denounced military arrests, conscriptions, emancipation, and other war measures. He was a candidate
                    for governor in 1864 and became known all over the state. At the nominating convention he was
                    defeated by Joseph McDonald, but he continued to make stump speeches for the campaign. Detectives
                    reported his speeches and soon the Republican Press teemed with denunciatory articles, charging him
                    with treason. Henry L. Zumro, a special detective, was appointed early in 1864 to watch him. He was
                    to visit Milligan for counsel, gain his confidence, and learn his personal sentiments. Zumro knew
                    Milligan was connected in some way <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-043-4-085"/> with the organization known
                    as the Knights of the Golden Circle. A part of the plan was <hi rend="i">to</hi> have Zumro arrested
                    on some political charge. A military officer from a distant part of the state was sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>

                    </placeName>, sustained his position on every point. It is the leading case upon the question
                    involved and fully settled that the civil law is superior to military law in all places where the
                    civil courts can be opened. The court said that a military commission has no jurisdiction legally to
                    try and sentence one not a resident of one of the rebellious states, nor a prisoner of war but a
                    citizen of Indiana, who was never in the military or naval service, but while at his home was
                    arrested and imprisoned on certain criminal charges preferred against him, tried, convicted, and
                    sentenced to be hanged by a military commission organized under a military commander of the military
                    district of Indiana. In a state where the federal authority was always open to hear criminal
                    accusations and redress grievances, no usage of war could sanction a military trial for any offense
                    whatever of a citizen in civil life, in no way connected with the military service. Congress could
                    grant no such power. The right of trial by jury is preserved to everyone accused of a crime who is
                    not attached to the army, navy, or militia in actual service. Martial law cannot arise from a
                    threatened invasion. The necessity must be actual and present, the invasion real, such as
                    effectually closes the courts and deposes the civil administration. If the military trial of
                    Milligan was contrary to law, then he was entitled on the facts stated in his petition, to be
                    discharged from custody by the terms of an act of Congress of March 3, 1863.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    ushered in by the roar of a cannon and at an early hour, people began to flock from every direction.
                    An address of welcome was made by Mayor William C. Kocher, and Milligan, although almost prostrated
                    by ill health, responded. He was then escorted to his residence a mile from the courthouse, and the
                    public meeting was continued all day, until late in the evening. Speeches were made by distinguished

                    dismissed. Milligan brought suit in the spring of 1868 against the military commission and others

                    He continued to practice law actively until October 27, 1897, sixty-two years after he had been
                    admitted to the Bar. In recent years the Milligans had made it their custom to live on the farm in

            <p>The death of Milligan brought to a close a life of an unusual and forceful personality. Perhaps we do
                    not agree with his point of view concerning the Civil War, but we should remember he was a
                    Southerner and his sympathies were with the South, but as one citizen remarked "Yes a
                    southerner–but he should have stayed there and fought WITH them." He believed in
                    "the cause" and stood four square even in the shadow of the gallows. Many of the

                    evidence while others repudiated their part in the organization, but when Milligan was offered
                    pardon he said, "I do not want pardon –I have done nothing I would not do

                    distant from Indiana, our own state should again be well represented. The number of persons from
                    Indiana who attended the meetings of this society the last two years was a subject of frequent and
                    favorable comment. History teachers in our high schools, colleges, and universities find these
                    meetings stimulating and helpful. The program is rapidly being completed with sessions planned on

            <p>When the War of 1812 began, Indiana was an exposed frontier. It was inadequately protected by Fort
                    Harrison near where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> at the head of the Maumee River. Far to the north Fort Mackinac was taken by the
                    British, July 17. The evacuation of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>

                    </placeName> was surrendered to General Isaac Brock by General William Hull. The war was then
                    carried into Indiana. The Pigeon Roost massacre took place south of a line drawn from <placeName>

                    </placeName> were attacked, all in the first week of September. Panic seized many of the
                    frontiersmen, but the forts were held and troops of militiamen and volunteers came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Among these was a Captain Robert <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> from Bourbon County.</p>
            <p>Major General Samuel Hopkins of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> militia soon had four thousand men under command. He advanced from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Fort Harrison early in October and on the fifteenth marched from the latter
                    supposedly on his way to Prophetstown. Evidently he was ambitious to "clear out all the
                    Indian tribes" along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and <geogName>Illinois river</geogName>s. After four days of marching the morale of the
                    army broke and on the twentieth it started to return to Fort Harrison, not having seen or met the
                    enemy. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> referred to sickness among the soldiers when they were encamped at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and at Fort Harrison. There were many desertions just before the army left the fort.
                    Discontent became widespread on the fourth day of its march. A grass fire probably started by the
                    Indians and a mistake by the guide were evidently used as pretexts to return. The men were
                    discharged at Busseron, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> on October 30.</p>
            <p>While Hopkins was on this ill-fated expedition, Colonel William Russell with two companies of
                    regulars marched to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> River where he assisted Governor Ninian Edwards of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Territory in an attack on the Kickapoo town at Lake <placeName>

            <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-043-4-096"/>
            <p>Hopkins, however, was not willing to be defeated by his own men for he organized a smaller army and
                    in November marched to Prophetstown. Captain Zachary Taylor, who was then in command of Fort
                    Harrison and who later became President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, led a detachment of regular troops. Three towns including Prophetstown were destroyed
                    and a small engagement was fought with the Indians. Cold weather seemingly prevented a larger
                    battle. The army left Fort Harrison on the eleventh of November and returned before the end of the
                    month.</p>
            <p>The letters of Robert <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> give evidence of the low morale of the volunteers who participated in the first
                    expedition. His company was inactive in camp at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and at Fort Harrison from September 25 to October 15. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> thought that the delay was due to improper conduct of the head officer. The quotation
                    from <hi rend="i">Niles' Register</hi> mentioned excessive rains. Hopkins blamed the failure on the
                    men and named only one officer as involved in the disaffection. The officer condemned was not
                    Captain <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From Hopkins' letter to Governor <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby</region>
                    </placeName> and from the letters of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it is evident that the privates chose the lesser officers and that the commanding
                    officer was dependent upon the pleasure of the lesser officers. Hopkins second foray into Indian
                    country was more successful, although it was not crowned with a victorious battle. Perhaps it
                    indicated that the failure of the first was not to be explained simply by improper conduct of the
                    commanding officer.</p>
            <p>When William H. Harrison went to the relief of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, he too experienced the faults of the militia system. He wrote of "the
                    impolicy of relying upon Militia, for the prosecution of the war."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The
                    next year Harrison carried the war into <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and so relieved the Indiana frontier.</p>

                                                    miles distant, and the <placeName>
                                                        <settlement type="city">Peoria</settlement>
                                                    </placeName> not more than one hundred and sixty. By breaking up
                                                    these, or as many as our resources would permit, we would be
                                                    rendering a service to all the territories. That from their numbers,
                                                    this tribe was more favorable than any near us; and from their
                                                    situation and hostility, had it more in their power to do us
                                                    mischief; of course to chastise and destroy these, would be
                                                    rendering real benefit to our country. It was observed by some
                                                    officers, that they would meet the next morning, consult together
                                                    and report to me their opinions; desiring at the same time to be
                                                    furnished with the person on whom I had relied for intelligence of
                                                    the country.</p>
                                    <p>This council was held, and all the intelligence furnished that had
                                                    been requested, and I had a report highly favorable to the
                                                    enterprize. This, to me, was more gratifying, as early as our
                                                    encampment at <placeName>
                                                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                                                    </placeName>, discontents and murmurings, that portended no wish to
                                                    proceed further. At Busseron, I found an evident increase of
                                                    discontent, although no army was ever better or more amply supplied
                                                    with rations and forage than at this place. At Fort Harrison, where
                                                    we encamped on the 10th, and where we were well supplied with
                                                    forage, &amp;c. I found on the 12th and 13th many breaking off
                                                    and returning without applying to me for a <hi rend="i">discharge,</hi> and as far as I know, without any notification to
                                                    their officers: Indeed I have every reason to suppose the officers
                                                    of every grade, gave no countenance to such a procedure.</p>
                                    <p>Thinking myself now secure in the confidence of my brother officers
                                                    and the army, we proceeded on our march early on the 15th, and
                                                    continued it four days, our course near north in the prairie until
                                                    we came to an Indian house, where some corn, &amp;c. had been
                                                    cultivated. The last day of the march to this place, I had been made
                                                    acquainted with a return of that spirit of discontent, that had, as
                                                    I had hoped, subsided, and when I had ordered a halt near sunset,
                                                    (for the first time that day) in a fine piece of grass in the
                                                    prairie, to aid our horses, I was addressed in the most rude and
                                                    dictatorial manner, requiring me immediately to resume my march, or
                                                    his battalion would break from the army and return!–This
                                                    was a major <hi rend="i">Singleton!</hi> I mention him in justice to
                                                    the other officers of that grade. But from every information, I
                                                    began to fear the army waited but for a pretext to return! This was
                                                    afforded next day by our guides, who had thought they had discerned
                                                    an Indian village on the side of a grove about ten miles from where
                                                    we encamped <hi rend="i">on</hi> the fourth night of our march, and
                                                    turned us about 6 or 8 miles <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-043-4-100"/>
                                                    out of our way. An almost universal discontent seemed to prevail,
                                                    and we took our course in such a direction as we hoped would best
                                                    atone for the error in the morning. About or after sun-set, we came
                                                    to a thin grove affording water; here we took up our camp; and about
                                                    this time arose one of the most violent gusts of wind I ever
                                                    remember to have seen, not proceeding from clouds. The Indians had
                                                    set fire to the prairie, which drove on us so furiously, that we
                                                    were compelled to fire around our camp, to protect ourselves. This
                                                    seems to have decided the army to return: I was informed of it so
                                                    many ways, that early in the next morning (Oct. 20th) I requested
                                                    the attendance of the general and field officers, and stated to them
                                                    my apprehensions, the expectations of our country, the disgrace
                                                    attending the measure, and the approbation of our own
                                                    consciences.–Against this, I stated the weary situation
                                                    of our horses and the want of provisions, (which to me seemed only
                                                    partial, six days having only passed since every part of the army,
                                                    as was believed, was furnished with ten days in bacon, beef or bread
                                                    stuff) the reasons given for returning; I requested the commandants
                                                    of each regiment to convene the whole of the officers belonging to
                                                    it, and to take fully the sense of the army on this measure; report
                                                    to commandants of brigades, who were requested to report to me in
                                                    writing; adding that if 500 volunteers would turn out, I would put
                                                    myself at their head, and proceed in quest of the towns; and the
                                                    balance of the army might retreat in <hi rend="i">safety</hi> to
                                                    Fort Harrison. In less than one hour the report was made almost
                                                    unanimously to return. I then requested that I might dictate the
                                                    course to be pursued that day only, which I pledged myself should
                                                    not put them more than six miles out of the way, my object being to
                                                    cover the reconnoitering parties, I wished to send out for the
                                                    discovery of the Indian towns. About this time the troops being
                                                    paraded, I put myself in front, took my course and directed them to
                                                    follow me; the columns moving off quite a contrary way. I sent
                                                    captain Taylor and major Lee to apply to the officers leading the
                                                    columns, to turn them. They were told it was not in their power. The
                                                    army had taken their course and would pursue it. Discovering great
                                                    confusion and disorder in the march, I threw myself in the rear,
                                                    fearing an attack on those who were there from necessity, and
                                                    continued in that position the whole day. The exhausted state of the
                                                    horses, nor the hunger of the men retarded this day's
                                                    march; so swiftly was it prosecuted that it was long before the rear
                                                    arrived at the encampment. The generals Ray, Ramsey and Allen, lent
                                                    all their aid and authority in restoring our march to order, and so
                                                    far succeeded, as to bring on the whole with much less loss than I
                                                    had feared; indeed I have no reason to think we were either followed
                                                    or menaced by an enemy. I think we march at least 80 or 90 miles in
                                                    the heart of the enemy's country: had he possessed a design
                                                    to fight us, opportunities in abundance presented. So formidable was
                                                    our appearance in the prairie, and in the country (as I aim told)
                                                    never trod before by hostile feet, must impress the bordering tribes
                                                    with a sense of their danger. If it operates beneficially in this
                                                    way, our labor will not be altogether in vain.</p>
                                    <p>I hope the expence attending this expedition will be found less than
                                                    usual on such occasions. I have consulted economy in every instance;

                                                    necessity has been the expenditure; the forage has been the heaviest

                                                    advocate general; who lived with me, took more than a common share
                                                    of fatigue and toil, and who did all in his power to further the

                                                    deserve well of me; I aim certain we were not 20 miles from the
                                                    Indian village when we were forced to retire, and I have many
                                                    reasons to prove we were in the right way.</p>
                                    <p>I have myself (superadded to the mortification I felt at thus
                                                    returning) been in a bad state of health from first to last; and am
                                                    now so weak as not to be able to keep myself on my horse.</p>
                                    <p>A violent diarrhea has pursued me 10 days past, and reduced me
                                                    extremely low; I had resolved to continue with the line of march a
                                                    little, if unable to ride. There are yet many things of which I wish
                                                    to write; they relate substantially to prospective operations. Soon
                                                    again shall I have the honor to address your excellency, in the mean
                                                    time be assured of the perfect consideration and high regards of
                                                    your obedient friend and servant.</p>

                                    of the Indian town, where he met one warrior who was shot down, and a brisk charge
                                    made upon the town defended by about 150 Indian warriors, who were put to flight
                                    with the loss of 25 found dead, besides a number carried off.</p>
                        <p>The women and children fled to a swamp at the first approach of our men, and the
                                    warriors soon took shelter under the same covert. We had only three men wounded.
                                    Four prisoners were taken, and about 60 horses prepared to remove the women and
                                    children with all their plunder fell into our hands. It appears that the Indians of

                                    women and children, who were preparing to move off when col. Russell arrived about
                                    10 o'clock in the morning. He destroyed every thing in the town which he
                                    could not bring away, and left it on the same evening; 7 scalps taken in September,
                                    near Fort Harrison, and also several Indians wounded during the late attack on that
                                    place, were found in the town.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the expedition of gen. Hopkins, has had the good effect of drawing

                        <salute>MY DEAR SIR–</salute>
                        <p>By Col. Richard Taylor, quarter-master general, who goes on as quick as possible to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, I have it in my power to give you general information of the movements
                                    of the army since my last.</p>
                        <p>On the 11th the army marched from Fort Harrison on the road formerly made by governor
                                    Harrison's army, and the boats set out at the same time. The length of time
                                    the enemy had expected us made it necessary to guard ourselves in an especial
                                    manner. The rise of the waters, from the heavy fall of rain preceding our march, and
                                    some large creeks, left us no doubt of considerable difficulty and embarrassment;
                                    insomuch that not until the 14th did we pass Sugar creek, three miles above the
                                    road.</p>
                        <p>From every information, I had no hesitation in moving on the east side of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName>. The Vermillions, Pine; Creek, and other impediments on the west side,
                                    superadded to the presumption that we were expected, and might more easily be
                                    annoyed and ambuscaded on that rout, determined me in this measure. The boats too,
                                    with our provisions of rations, forage and military stores, could be more easily
                                    covered and protected, as the line of march could be invariably nearer the river.
                                    Lieutenant-colonel Barbour, with one battalion of his regiment, had command of the 7
                                    boats, and encamped with us on the bank of the river almost every night. This so
                                    protracted our march that we did not reach the Prophet's town until the
                                    19th. On the morning <list type="footnotes">

                                    </placeName>, surrounded the place about break of day, but found it evacuated. There
                                    were in the main town about forty houses, many of them from 30 to 50 feet in length,
                                    besides many temporary huts in the surrounding prairie, in which they had cultivated
                                    a good deal of corn. On the 20th, 21st and 22d we were embarked in the complete
                                    destruction of the Prophet's town which had about 40 cabins and huts, and
                                    the large Kickapoo village adjoining below it on the west side of the river,
                                    consisting of about 160 cabins and huts; finding and destroying their corn,
                                    reconnoitring the cirmcumjacent country, and constructing works for the defence of
                                    our boats and army. Seven miles east of us, on the Ponce Passu creek, a party of
                                    Indians were discovered; they had fired on a small party of ours on the 21st and
                                    killed a man by the name of Dunn, a gallant soldier in captain Duval's
                                    company. On the 22d upwards of 60 horsemen, under the command of lieutenant-colonels
                                    Miller and Wilcox, anxious to bury their comrade as well as gain a more complete
                                    knowledge of the ground, went on to a point near the Indian encampment, fell into an
                                    ambuscade, and 18 of our party killed, wounded and missing. Among these are three
                                    hopeful young officers and one private from the 8th (Wilcox's) regiment,
                                    viz. Mars, Edwards, Murray, and the private Webb, presumed to be killed; the other
                                    14 were of the rangers. On the return of this party, and the information of a large
                                    assemblage of the enemy, who, encouraged by the strength of their camp, appeared to
                                    be waiting for us, every preparation was made to march early and engage the enemy at
                                    every risque; when, from the most violent storm and fall of snow, attended with the
                                    coldest weather I ever saw or felt at this season of the year, and which did not
                                    subside until the evening of the 23d, we were delayed until the 24th. Upon arriving
                                    on the ground, we found the enemy had deserted their camp before the fall of the
                                    snow, and passed the Ponce Passu. I have no doubt but their ground was the strongest
                                    I ever have seen–the deep rapid creek spoken of was in their rear,
                                    running in a semi-circle, and fronted by a bluff 100 feet high, almost perpendicular
                                    and only to be penetrated by three steep ravines. If the enemy would not defend
                                    themselves here, it was evident they did not intend fighting at all. After
                                    reconnoitring sufficiently, we returned to camp, and found the ice so accumulated as
                                    to alarm us for the return of the boats. I had fully intended to have spent one more
                                    week in endeavoring to find the Indian camps; but the shoeless, shirtless state of
                                    the troops, now clad in the remnants of their summer dress; a river full of ice; the
                                    hills covered with snow; a rigid climate, and no certain point to which we could
                                    further direct our operations; under the influence of the advice of every staff and
                                    field officer, orders were given and measures pursued for our return on the 25th.</p>
                        <p>We are now progressing to Fort Harrison through ice and snow where we expect to
                                    arrive on the last day of this month. From <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                                    </placeName> I shall have the honor of addressing your excellency again; but before
                                    I close this, I cannot forbear expressing the merits of the <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-043-4-104"/> officers and soldiers of this command. After leaving
                                    [at] Fort Harrison all unfit for duty, we had in privates of every corps about one
                                    thousand –in the total twelve hundred and fifty or thereabout. At the
                                    Prophet's town, upwards of one hundred of these were on the sick report.
                                    Yet, sir, have we progressed in such order as to menace our enemy, free from any
                                    annoyance; seven large keel-boats have been covered and protected to a point
                                    heretofore unknown in Indian expeditions; three large Indian establishments have
                                    been burnt and destoyed, with near three miles of fence, (and all the corn,
                                    &amp;c. we could find) besides many smaller ones; the enemy have been sought in
                                    their strong holds, and every opportunity afforded them to attack or alarm us; a

                                    perfected; and this has been done with a naked army of infantry, aided by only about
                                    fifty rangers and spies. All this was done in twenty days–no sigh, no
                                    murmur, no complaint.</p>
                        <p>I certainly feel particular obligations to my friends general <placeName>

                                    The firm and almost unparlelled defence of Fort Harrison, by captain Z. Taylor, has
                                    raised for him a fabric of character not to be effaced by my eulogy. To colonel
                                    Barbour, for his officer-like management, in conducting and commanding the boats, my
                                    thanks are due, as also to colonels Miller and Wilcox, and to majors Hughes and
                                    Shacklet, and to the captains and subalterns of the army generally. From lieutenants
                                    Richeson, Hawkins and Sullivan of the <placeName>

            <p>The victory of the British over the French, the unwillingness of the conquered to accept the result
                    as final, the unrealistic Indian policy of the victors, and the dissatisfaction of the aborigines
                    produced a general uprising and not a conspiracy inspired by one leader. Thus may be briefly
                    summarized the contribution of this new biography of Pontiac, which rejects or at least seriously
                    modifies the idea of conspiracy which Francis Parkman popularized in <hi rend="i">The Conspiracy of
                        Pontiac.</hi> The author in support of his conclusion describes briefly the preaching of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> Prophet, the efforts of the Seneca Indians to instigate a revolt, and the slowness with
                    which Pontiac arose to a position of general leadership. Additional material has come to light since
                    Parkman wrote. Minor details are also corrected. Peckham points out that his predecessor accepted a
                    story written by Major Robert Rogers which appears to have been a fabrication (p. 59); that the
                    story of the betrayal which Parkman related, even to the supposed conversation, was in reality one
                    of several traditions, none of which can be established as true (pp. 122-125); and that the place of
                    the assassination of the leader was incorrect (p. 311). The volume is not, however, a rewriting of
                    Parkman's work.</p>
            <p>The author frankly admits that there are gaps in our information about Pontiac and that several of
                    the accepted stories are unsupported by documentary evidence. An illustration of the latter is the
                    story of Pontiac's supposed participation in the defeat of General Edward Braddock. He may have been
                    there, but there is no evidence. Almost nothing is known of his early life, his birth, parents, and
                    place of nativity. The author describes what might have happened to a normal <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName> youth, which is interesting background material for a better understanding of the
                    Indians. Pontiac was a leader in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> area during the beginning stage of the uprising, but he was not the head of a
                    widespread conspiracy. Failing in his efforts to capture the fort at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he appealed to other tribes to attack the English. Fort after fort fell before the
                    attacks of the aborigines, but</p>

                    </placeName>, Niagara, and Fort Pitt were not taken. The losses inflicted upon the British were
                    heavy. His leadership attracted much support and admiration but was not universally accepted. Forced
                    to give up the seige of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Pontiac retired to the Maumee. He sought help from the French in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Country in order to renew the war the following summer. Failing to secure assistance
                    from this source, he continued to plan an attack with the support of the Shawnee and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>. When this also failed, he made peace with the English. During the negotiations the
                    English gave him much attention, and he assumed a commanding position. This may have been intended
                    to arouse the jealousy of other chiefs. If this were true, it worked only too well. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Peoria</settlement>
                    </placeName> Indians resolved to kill him and, without much delay, the deed was perpetrated by a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Peoria</settlement>
                    </placeName> who pretended friendship. The failure of the Indians to join in unified support of
                    Pontiac doomed their way of life to disappear before the English speaking peoples. He possessed many
                    elements of greatness and his failure was in reality the failure of his people. He should not,
                    however, be idealized for he was cruel and untruthful.</p>
            <p>The volume is neatly printed on good paper and attractively bound. It includes several excellent maps
                    and illustrations, an adequate index, and a classified but not an annotated bibliography. No
                    typographical errors were noted. It is a pleasure to read a book that is free from the limitations
                    imposed during the war years.</p>
            <p>Errors seem to be very few and of an insignificant character. A small slip (pp. 38-39) has George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> sent to retake Fort Duquesne rather than to protect the men building the original fort

                    </placeName> Company. Some of the footnotes, as the one on page 225, are very inadequate as
                    references. An instance of overstatement seems to have occurred on page 276 where Pontiac even in
                    his submission "was for the moment more powerful than Johnson or Gage." West

            <p>This excellent book has been well reviewed by competent authorities and can be recommended as an
                    essential first reading for anyone interested in the collecting of books or other historical
                    materials.</p>
            <p>Before Peckham came to the Indiana Historical Bureau as director, he was associated with Storm on the
                    staff of the William L. Clements Library in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ann Arbor</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This book is the result of their shared experience and enthusiasm and it's a dandy!</p>
            <p>Book collecting is more than the hobby of antiquarians who love and wish to recreate the past. It is
                    more than the preservation of documents for the writing of political, social or literary history.
                    The art of book collecting carries with it a strong creative impulse. It is rewarded by adventure,
                    accomplishment and the lure of the unattainable. The satisfaction of the creative impulse can be
                    illustrated by the discovery of an unknown Indiana imprint. The place, date and publisher provide
                    new facts for the history of printing in Indiana. The content of the book, the author and his
                    significance, may lead to a reinterpretation of an important phase of our history and development.</p>
            <p>A better description of the motives and pleasures of collecting can be found in the third chapter of
                    Storm and Peckham. This chapter leads quickly into fuller discussions on Americana, literature,
                    manuscripts and other materials. The style is lively. It quickens the reader and never dulls the
                    subject.</p>
            <p>But the book is more than a justification of collecting. It contains sound, practical advice on
                    buying and selling. It is full of the anecdotes and the kind of talk that collectors enjoy.</p>
            <p>An extra value that collectors attach to books comes from the factor of association. For example, a
                        <hi rend="i">Ben Hur</hi> inscribed by the author to Mrs. Wallace would be very dear. <hi rend="i">Invitation to Book Collecting</hi> has this extra value, for it is written by an
                    Indiana author whose association with us has been direct and always pleasant.</p>
            <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-043-4-108"/>
            <p>If you would know why a collector is, or if you are yourself a collector of books or other objects,
                    this is a book for you.</p>

            <p>It seems necessary to regard this work as literature rather than history. It contains too many minor
                    errors, it omits too many important but less dramatic phases of the development of the Old
                    Northwest, and it includes or overemphasizes too much of the legendary to be regarded as history. If
                    one insists upon applying to it the standards of the historical profession, the resulting evaluation
                    of the work is necessarily more harsh than the effort deserves.</p>
            <p>The work has considerable value, particularly in relation to the Great Lakes region and its
                    settlement and growth. The author understands the Indians and the French. He brings out the
                    importance of the surveyor and pictures under-standingly the work of the boatmen and the builders of
                    canals, roads, and railroads. He closes the volume with a detailed and enlightening survey of
                    developments along the shores of the Great Lakes. The author has a beautiful style, and he knows how
                    to paint an effective picture. An intelligent and informed reader will surely find it to be well
                    worth reading. Quite probably it will be a popular work.</p>
            <p>Without intending to be overly critical, it may be desirable to warn the unwary of some of its
                    deficiencies. The author's sweeping generalizations must be examined critically for they are often
                    too inclusive. In striving for effect, he is sometimes inaccurate. His knowledge of the early
                    history of the Northwest and Indiana territories is inadequate. He fails to recognize the
                    controversy over La Salle's supposed voyage on the <placeName>

                    </placeName>," has had a typical but nevertheless an interesting existence during the past
                    one hundred years. Located in the sleepy river town of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>, <region type="county">Perry County</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana, it began
                    its growth with the arrival of many <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Catholic immigrants who disembarked there in the middle of the nineteenth century to
                    seek new homes in southern Indiana. Not a little of the early Catholic influence of that region can
                    be traced to the advertising policy of Father Kundek whose plan was to settle the strip of land
                    between <placeName>

                    </placeName> with Catholic farmers. To that end he made good use of Catholic weeklies in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the surrounding regions.</p>
            <p>As a short account of St. Pius Parish, this booklet rises above the standard usually found in such
                    congregational histories, for the author has shown a gratifying objectivity in the use of the
                    material he had at hand. His work includes entertaining biographical sketches of the many pastors,
                    whose occasional shortcomings and idiocyncrasies are not glossed over. Interesting accounts of the
                    fathers' activities range from the account of the priest who had to be wakened "in the
                    sight of all the church" to conduct service, to the gripping story of faithful
                    ministrations to the injured and dying on the river steamer "Reindeer," which had
                    blown up near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Humor too is present, as in the account of the priest who from the pulpit denounced by
                    name those who had failed in regard to their contributions, thus eliciting a brazen,
                    "Here!" from one pious delinquent as his name is mentioned. And then there is the
                    story of the ecclesiastic who suggested that the three saloons of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
                    </placeName> be put out of business without loss to their owners by having the parish buy them out.
                    In this the parishoners cheerfully agreed, "only that they preferred to buy the stock not
                    all at once, but glass by glass."</p>
            <p>The faults of the treatise are few. Such a statement as "Indiana fought with the Union, <placeName>

                    use some modification, but on a whole the parish record of St. Pius is well done and should be of
                    especial interest to students of the early history of Roman Catholicism in Indiana.</p>

            <p>In conjunction with his anthropological and ethnological work with the Bureau of American Ethnology,
                    John R. Swanton brings together into this his latest work the results of almost five decades of
                    careful research on the southeastern tribes of American Indians. His pre-eminence in this
                    specialized field is unquestioned. The prolificness of Swanton's works-well over a score of books,
                    articles, and three cooperative Indian language dictionaries-are all definite contributions to the
                    all too inadequate funds of knowledge we possess as to language, lore, society, history, culture,
                    and sources concerning the American Indian. His pioneering work has blazed new paths, and it is to
                    be hoped that others will not only follow his paths but in turn blaze new ones.</p>
            <p>To claim definitiveness for this work would be a claim of absurdity, for as Swanton has pointed out
                    in his introduction, "no claim of a hundred-percent completion . . . can ever be made
                    safely, since some manuscript may at any tune be drawn from its place of concealment and modify
                    materially everything that has been published, or even occasion a total revolution in our ideas
                    regarding it" (p. 1). It is, however, a handbook that should be required reading for anyone
                    anticipating research concerning the southeastern Indians. In this respect it may be considered the
                    standard treatment of the subject.</p>
            <p>Swanton defines the southeastern Indians as those who lived "between the 24th and 39th
                    parallels of N. latitude and the 75th and 96th meridians of W. longitude" (pp. 1-2).
                    Archaeologically the province of the southeastern Indians includes "most of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley and as far up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="409" id="VAA4025-043-4-111"/> as southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. The difference between the two indicates plainly a later shrinkage of culture bearing
                    tribes toward the south and in some measure toward the east and west" (p. 2). The treatise
                    deals mainly with questions of culture and therefore classifies the southeastern tribes by
                    linguistic and political considerations.</p>
            <p>Swanton's volume discusses geography of the southeast with the aid of such auxiliary sciences as
                    physiography and climatology; classifies the southeastern tribes on bases of linguistic and
                    political considerations; conjectures as to the correlation of population to physiographic areas,
                    especially the indigenous and aboriginal elements; sketches the history of the tribes, considered as
                    a whole, from prehistoric times to the mid-nineteenth century; gives an encyclopedic and succinct
                    sketch of over one hundred and seventy-five southeastern tribes from "Abihka" to
                    "Yustaga," each from one paragraph to four and one-half pages in length; and
                    presents a great wealth and large quantity of cultural information concerning such things as use of
                    raw materials, hunting and fishing methods, domestication of animals, housing, clothing,
                    ornamentation, household utensils, musical instruments, and societal and ceremonial life. This is
                    followed by a comparison of the southeast with corresponding areas in other parts of the world.
                    Swanton then asserts that "though students of culture still have work to do here, the
                    future study of the Southeastern Indians rests mainly with the archeologists" (p. 827).</p>
            <p>The text is replete throughout with adequate citations and documentation. The ample bibliography is
                    evidence of the thoroughness of the work. The critical essay on source materials is valuable.
                    Swanton has also included 107 plates -some actual photographs, and others sketches by earlier
                    explorers and writers-of survivors of the various tribes, of cultural remains both individualistic
                    and tribal, and of many other artifacts. This collection of plates in itself makes the volume a
                    valuable one.</p>
            <p>Minor historical errors are few and not of enough consequence to detract from the value of the text
                    as a whole. Swanton forgets, for example, the Isle d'Orleans was an exception when he states that in
                    1763 "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>

                    Provincials at the hands of the Cherokee, (p. 112), is erroneous. For the size and scope of the
                    work, however, the number of errors is suprisingly small.</p>
            <p>Swanton has made a very commendable contribution and deserves much praise for his labors. His superb
                    work should become a reference volume for every student of the Indians of the southeast and also for
                    those interested in the history of that area.</p>
