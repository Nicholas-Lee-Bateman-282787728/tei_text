                        told a story of English achievement. It is fitting that I should inscribe it
                        to you, who of all the Englishmen of this generation have rendered the most
                        eminent service to the American Commonwealth. You have shown with admirable
                        clearness and candor, and with marvelous breadth of thought and sympathy,
                        what are the results in the present time of the English beginnings in
                        America, and to you, therefore, I offer this volume. I need not assure you
                        that it gives me great pleasure to write your name here as godfather to my
                        book, and to subscribe myself, my dear Mr. Bryce,</hi>

                <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> this work, brought to completion after many years of
                    patient research, I have sought to trace from their source the various and often
                    complex movements that resulted in the early English settlements in America, and
                    in the evolution of a great nation with English speech and traditions.<note
                        id="note_1" place="right" anchored="yes">
                        <p>P<hi rend="sc">REFACE</hi>.</p>
                    </note> It has been my aim to make these pages reflect the character of the age
                    in which the English colonies were begun, and the traits of the colonists, and
                    to bring into relief the social, political, intellectual, and religious forces
                    that promoted emigration. This does not pretend to be the usual account of all
                    the events attending early colonization; it is rather a history in which the
                    succession of cause and effect is the main topica history of the dynamics of
                    colony-planting in the first half of the seventeenth century. Who were the
                    beginners of English life in America? What propulsions sent them for refuge to a
                    wilderness? What visions beckoned them to undertake the founding of new states?
                    What manner of men were their leaders? And what is the story of their hopes,
                    their experiments, and their disappointments? These are the questions I have
                    tried to answer.</p>
                <p>The founders of the little settlements that had the unexpected fortune to expand
                    into an empire I have not been able to treat otherwise than unreverently. Here
                    are no forefathers or foremothers, but simply English men and women of the
                    seventeenth century, with the faults and fanaticisms as well as the virtues of
                    their age. I have disregarded that convention which <pb id="VAA2449-006"
                        n="viii"/> makes it obligatory for a writer of American history to explain
                    that intolerance in the first settlers was not just like other intolerance, and
                    that their cruelty and injustice were justifiable under the circumstances. This
                    walking backward to throw a mantle over the nakedness of ancestors may be
                    admirable as an example of diluvian piety, but it is none the less reprehensible
                    in the writing of history.</p>
                <p>While the present work is complete in itself, it is also part of a larger
                    enterprise, as the half-title indicates. In January, 1880, I began to make
                    studies for a History of Life in the United States. For the last sixteen or
                    seventeen years by far the greater part of my time has been given to researches
                    on the culture history of the United States in the period of English domination,
                    that &quot;good old colony time&quot; about which we have had more
                    sentiment than information. As year after year was consumed in this toilsome
                    preparation, the magnitude of the task became apparent, and I began to feel the
                    fear for my work so felicitously expressed by Ralegh, &quot;that the
                    darkness of age and death would have covered over both it and me before the
                    performance.&quot; It seemed better, therefore, to redeem from the chance of
                    such mishap a portion of my work, by completing this most difficult part of the
                    task, in order that when, early or late, the inevitable night shall fall, the
                    results of my labor, such as they are, may not be wholly covered over by the
                    darkness.</p>
                <p>There is always difference of opinion in regard to the comparative fullness with
                    which the several portions of a historical narrative should be treated, and I
                    can not hope to escape criticism on this point. I have related some events with
                    what will be considered disproportionate amplitude of detail. But the
                    distinctive purpose of this work is to give an insight into the life and
                    character of the people, and there are details that make the reader feel the
                    very spirit and manner of the time. It is better to let the age disclose itself
                    in action; it <pb id="VAA2449-007" n="ix"/> is only by ingenious eavesdropping
                    and peeps through keyholes that we can win this kind of knowledge from the past.
                    Literary considerations should have some weight in deciding how fully an episode
                    shall be treated, unless the historian is content to perform the homely service
                    of a purveyor of the crude ore of knowledge. I have sought to make this
                    &quot;a work of art as well as of historical science,&quot; to borrow a
                    phrase from Augustin Thierry. Some omissions in this volume will be explained
                    when its successors appear.</p>
                <p>I find it an embarrassing task to make acknowledgment to those who have assisted
                    me; the debts that have accumulated since I began are too many to be recorded. I
                    must not neglect to express my grateful remembrance of the hospitality shown to
                    my researches during my various sojourns in England. At the British Museum and
                    at the Public Record Office every facility has been extended to me, and a
                    similar attention was shown to my wants at other less public repositories of
                    books, such as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. To Dr. Richard
                    Garnett, the head of the printed book department of the Museum, I owe thanks for
                    many personal attentions. I am also indebted to Mr. E. M. Thompson, keeper of
                    the manuscripts in the museum. The late Mr. W. Noel Sainsbury, of the Public
                    Record Office, was very obliging. I owe most of all to the unfailing kindness of
                    the Right Honorable James Bryce, M. P., who found time, in the midst of his
                    preoccupations as a member of Parliament and his duties in high office, to
                    secure for me access to private stores of historical material. Lord Edmund
                    Fitzmaurice with generous kindness put himself to much trouble to facilitate my
                    examination of the manuscripts at Landsdowne House. I am indebted to Lord
                    Leconsfield for permission to visit Petworth House and read there
                    Percy&apos;s Trewe Relacion in the original manuscript. I must ask others in
                    England who befriended my researches to accept a general acknowledgment, but I
                    can not forget <pb id="VAA2449-008" n="x"/> their courtesy to a stranger. In
                    common with other students I received polite attentions during my researches in
                    Paris at the Bibliothque Nationale.</p>
                <p>In this country I owe much to the librarians of public libraries and their
                    assistantstoo much to allow me to specify my obligations to individuals. At the
                    Astor, and at the Lenox, undr its more recent management, my debt has been
                    continual for many years. Acknowledgments are due to the officers of the Boston
                    Public Library, the Library of Congress, the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, and
                    the libraries of the New York, the Massachusetts, the Pennsylvania, the
                    Maryland, and the Virginia Historical Societies. To Harvard College Library and
                    to the New York State Library I am specially indebted; from them I have been
                    able to supplement my own collection by borrowing. The Brooklyn Mercantile
                    Library has granted me similar privileges. The New York Mercantile Library, on
                    the other hand, I have not found hospitable to research.</p>
                <p>To my generous friend Mr. Justin Winsor I owe thanks for many favors. Dr. Thomas
                    Addis Emmet opened his valuable collection to me, and the late Mr. S. L. M.
                    Barlow showed me similar kindness. My friend, Mr. Oscar S. Straus, permitted me
                    to use at my own desk valuable works from his collection. There are others whose
                    friendly attentions can be more fitly recognized in later volumes of this
                    series, and yet others whom I must beg to accept this general but grateful
                    acknowledgment.</p>
                <p>Mr. W. W. Duffield, the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, supplied
                    the artist with the coast charts from which the maps in this volume were
                    drawn.</p>
                <p>To avoid misapprehension, it is needful to say that this is not a re-issue of
                    anything I have heretofore produced. The lectures on the culture history of the
                    United States given at Columbia College and other institutions were never
                    written or reported. The papers on colonial life contributed to the Century
                    Magazine in <pb id="VAA2449-009" n="xi"/> 1882, and the years following, were on

                                departure in the history of the English race. All the conditions
                                excited men to unwonted intellectual activity. The art of printing
                                was yet a modern invention; the New World with its novelties and
                                unexplained mysteries was a modern discovery; and there were endless
                                discussions and agitations of spirit growing out of the recent
                                reformation in religion. Imagination was powerfully stimulated by
                                the progress of American exploration, by the romantic adventures of
                                the Spaniards in the West Indies, and their dazzling conquest of
                                new-found empires in Mexico and Peru. It was an age of creation in
                                poetry, in science, and in religion, and men of action were
                                everywhere set on deeds of daring. The world had regained something
                                of the vigor and spontaneity of youth, but <pb id="VAA2449-014"

                                stories. The stage plays of that drama-loving age reflected the
                                interest in the supernatural and the eager curiosity about far-away
                                countries. Books of travel fitted the prevailing taste. He who could
                                afford to buy them regaled himself with the great folios of
                                Hakluyt&apos;s Voyages and Purchas his Pilgrimes. General
                                readers delighted in little tracts and pamphlets relating incidents
                                of far-away travels, or describing remote countries and the peoples
                                inhabiting them, or the &quot;monstrous strange beasts&quot;

                                to stretch from Magellan&apos;s Strait southward to the pole. It
                                was easy to believe in these two superfluous continents; they were
                                mirages of the New World. Every great discovery excites expectation
                                of others like it. And in a time when vague report or well-worn
                                tradition counted for more than observation or experimental
                                knowledge, it was inevitable that current information about America
                                should be distorted and mixed with fable. In that age, still
                                pre-Baconian, men had few standards by which to measure
                                probabilities, and to <pb id="VAA2449-015" n="3"/> those shut in by

                                because it lay between Europe and the East Indian Spice Islands by
                                the westward route. Columbus, seeking the less, found the greater by
                                stumbling on it in the dark. Zuan Cabotoin English, John Cabotwho is
                                described by a contemporary as &quot;a Venetian fellow with a
                                fine mind, greatly skilled in navigation,&quot; discovered North
                                America in 1497. But he did not exult that he was the finder of a
                                vast and fertile continent in which great nations might germinate,
                                for he believed that his landfall at Cape Breton was within the
                                dominions of the Grand Cham of China, and he sailed down the coast
                                again the next year, &quot;ever with the intent to find said
                                passage to India.&quot; It was announced on his return from his

                                sufficient to remove the illusion that America was connected with
                                Asia. The notion that the New World was an Asiatic peninsula died
                                lingeringly about the middle of the sixteenth century; but to reach

                                as an obstruction. The belief in a passage to the Pacific by means
                                of some yet-to-be-discovered strait severing the continent of
                                America, survived far into the seventeenth century, and the hope of
                                coming by some-short cut into a rich commerce with the Orient led to

                                </note> the famous geographer, Richard Hakluyt, one of those men
                                that exert a marked influence in favor of a new movement mainly by
                                ardor and industry. Hakluyt&apos;s fervor was akin to
                                enthusiasm, his belief of every story favorable to projects for
                                colonization, and his unwavering faith in the projects themselves
                                bordered on flat credulity. To men of his own time his tireless
                                advocacy of American exploration and colony-planting must have
                                seemed irksome hobby-riding. But he was the indispensable forerunner
                                of colonization. &quot;Your Mr. Hakluyt hath served for a very
                                good trumpet,&quot; says Sidney. Believing in everything
                                American as un-waveringly <pb id="VAA2449-018" n="6"/> waveringly as
                                if his soul&apos;s salvation depended on his faith, he believed
                                in nothing more sublimely than in a passage to the &quot;South
                                Sea&quot; or Pacific Ocean. He seized on every vague intimation
                                of ignorant map-makers, on every suspicion of an explorer, on every
                                fond tale of an Indian that tended to lend support to the theory in
                                hand. All evidence was of equal weight in his scales, provided it
                                lay on the affirmative side of the balance. It mattered little to
                                him where his witnesses placed this elusive passage. In
                                Hakluyt&apos;s mind it was ubiquitous. The Pacific is now
                                &quot;on the backside&quot; of Montreal Island, and the
                                great Laurentian lakes suffer a sea change; now it is reached by a
                                river flowing three months to the southwardthat is, the Mississippi.
                                Then the much-sought strait is carried northward on the authority of
                                an old map&quot; a great old round carde &quot;shown him

                                was only when the large and lucid mind of Sir Walter Ralegh took up
                                the subject seriously that the settlement of an agricultural colony
                                became for a while the real object of American voyages. Ralegh sent
                                no men to the arctic or to the wintry shores of Newfoundland, as
                                Frobisher and Gilbert had done. He turned to milder latitudes, and
                                dispatched his explorers in 1584, and his colonists in 1585, to the
                                coast of what is now North Carolina.</p>

                                that western sea which Hakluyt had seen it on the mightie old mappe
                                in parchment,&quot; understood the inventive savages to say that
                                the Roanoke River sprang from a rock so near to a sea that the waves
                                in storm often dashed into this fountain, making the river brackish
                                for some distance below. That the story might be more interesting,
                                they added that there was gold there, and that the walls of a town
                                in that land were made of pearls. This is what the white men fancied
                                the Indians said; but whatever they said was spoken in <pb

                                lasted a hundred and fourteen years. No <pb id="VAA2449-021" n="9"/>
                                passage north of Magellan&apos;s Strait had been found, yet a
                                belief in the existence of such a water-way remained a part of the
                                geographical creed of the time. The Jamestown emigrants were
                                officially instructed to explore that branch of any river that lay
                                toward the northwest, perhaps because the charmed latitude of 40
                                might thus be reached. It was in carrying out this instruction that
                                Captain John Smith came to grief at the hands of the Indians while
                                looking for the Pacific in the swamps of the Chickahominy. Smith
                                rarely mixed his abounding romance with his geography; he is as
                                sober and trustworthy in topographical description and in map-making
                                as he is imaginative in narration. But Smith was at this time under
                                the influence of the prevailing delusion, and he hoped that his
                                second voyage up the Chesapeake would lead him into the Pacific. His

                                hopes of those alchemists who were able to produce gold merely by
                                the use of arguments. The mines in Virginia moved farther west. It
                                wanted only that explorers should reach the mountains. In spite of
                                the sickness that wasted the colony in 1610, Lord De la Warr sent an
                                expedition to dig gold on the upper James, but the warlike up-river
                                tribes soon drove the prospectors back. In 1634, Sir John Harvey
                                sent another body of men on the same fool&apos;s errand, though
                                there had not been found in all the years preceding a particle of
                                tangible evidence that gold existed in Virginia. But on the James,

                                Hawkins, because the ship lacked provisions. Ingram, traveling from
                                tribe to tribe, achieved the notable feat of crossing the continent

                                </note> popular curiosity regarding the Indians. The American
                                savages were sometimes treated as sun-worshipers, but they were more
                                commonly thought <pb id="VAA2449-028" n="16"/> to be worshipers of
                                devils. The prevailing belief in witchcraft, divination, and
                                abounding evil spirits rendered it easy for Europeans to accept the
                                Indian deities as supernatural beings, and to credit the pretensions
                                of the powwows, or Indian priests, to give knowledge of distant or
                                future events, to heal the sick, and even to bring rain time of
                                drought. But it was observed at Plymouth that when the Pilgrims
                                prayed for rain it fell gently, and that the rain procured by the
                                Indian conjurers was violent and destructivea rain with something
                                devilish about it. According to writers of the time, the demons
                                worshiped by the savages were able to materialize themselves on
                                great occasions, appearing to their votaries in some beastly form.
                                This belief in Indian devil-worship fitted well with the religious
                                faith of the period, which can hardly be described as anything but a
                                sort of Manichism dividing the government of the universe almost
                                equally between good and evil powers. Religionists of all schools
                                desired to convert these subjects of Satan, not from those
                                philanthropic motives that are main considerations in modern
                                propagandism, but because their conversion would glorify God, and
                                yet more because it would despite the devil. Sometimes the religious
                                motive was incongruously supported by hopes of commercial advantage.
                                The navigator Davis wrote to Secretary Walsingham that if the
                                Indians &quot;were once brought over to the Christian faith they
                                might soon be brought to relish a more civilized kind of life and be

                                activity and extended geographical knowledge one can form but a weak
                                conception of the excitement produced by the sight of &quot;the

                                got of the New World as the mists of ignorance slowly lifted from

                                and the romantic spirit dwell together. The imagination in such an
                                age usurped the place of discrimination, and the wonderful became
                                the probable. The appetite for the marvelous fostered exaggeration;
                                every man who had sailed in foreign seas thought it shame not to
                                tell of wonders. The seventeenth century indeed betrayed a
                                consciousness of its own weakness in a current proverb,
                                &quot;Travelers lie by license.&quot; History and fiction
                                had not yet been separated. Like every other romantic age, the
                                period of Elizabeth, and James was prodigal of daring adventure;
                                every notable man aspired to be the hero of a tale. English
                                beginnings in America were thus made in a time abounding in bold

                                such communications, and he relates an anecdote of misapprehension
                                by this very party sent under Grenville and Lane: &quot;The same
                                happened among the English, which I sent under Sir Richard
                                Greeneville to inhabit Virginia. For when some of my people asked
                                the name of that country, one of the savages answered, <hi rend="i"
                                    >&apos;Wingandacon,&apos;</hi> which is as much as to
                                say, as, <hi rend="i">&apos;You wear good
                                    cloaths,&apos;</hi> or gay cloaths.&quot; From this
                                answer it came that the coast of North Carolina was called
                                &quot;Wingandacon,&quot; or, in its Latinized form,
                                Wingindacoa, while the chief, or &quot;king,&quot; of the
                                country appears in the narratives of the time as Wingina. Ralegh
                                says that Yucatan means merely &quot;What say you?&quot; and
                                that Peru got its name from a similar mistake.</p>

                                desire for a short passage to the East Indies is traceable to the
                                passion that existed in Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth
                                centuries for spices, and this no doubt came from the gross forms of
                                cookery in that time. Anderson&apos;s Commerce, sub anno 1504,
                                cites Guicciardini on the great quantities of spices used, and adds:
                                &quot;For in those days the people of Europe were much fonder of
                                spices in their cookery, etc., than they have been in later
                                times.&quot; The rise in the price of commodities in
                                Elizabeth&apos;s time may have been only apparent, but it
                                promoted voyages looking to the extension of commerce. Compare

                                painting himself and bought the pigment, which being burned in a
                                crucible yielded two pieces of gold. (See the translation in New

                                beheld its specter in the sky. Of the Hudson River gold mines no

                                by Ingram was inserted in Hakluyt&apos;s Divers Voyages in 1589.
                                It was omitted in the later edition as too incredible even for
                                Hakluyt. See also a paper by Dr. De Costa, in the Magazine of
                                American History, March, 1883, on the copy of Ingram&apos;s
                                Statement preserved in the Bodleian Library. Ingram&apos;s
                                story, and others like it, seem to be satirized in the play of
                                Eastward, Ho! by Chapman, Jonson, and Marston. The assertion of
                                Seagull, in the play, that &quot;they have in their houses
                                scowpes, buckets, and diverse other vessels of massie
                                silver,&quot; would seem at first sight to be an unmistakable
                                allusion to the extravagance of Ingram&apos;s narrative. But in
                                the second edition of Bullein&apos;s A Dialogue against the
                                Fever Pestilence, which was published in 1573, one Mendax,
                                describing an unknown land, declares that &quot;their pottes,
                                panns, and all vessells are cleane gold garnished with
                                diamondes.&quot; This shows that Ingram&apos;s story had
                                probably absorbed certain traits from what I have ventured to call
                                European folklore tales about Americafolk tales originally applied
                                to the Orient, no doubt; echoes of Sir John Mandeville and Marco
                                Polo, perhaps. Of course it is just possible, but not probable, that
                                Bullein had heard the tales of Ingram, who had returned three years
                                or more before he printed his second edition. The authors of

                                suggest to assure the failure of the enterprise. King James, who was
                                frivolously fond of puttering in novel projects, had personally
                                framed a code of unwise laws and orders. The supremacy of the
                                sovereign and the interests of the Church were pedantically guarded,
                                but the colony was left without any ruler with authority enough to
                                maintain order. The private interest of the individual, the most
                                available of all motives to industry, was merged in that of the
                                commercial company to which Virginia had been granted. All the
                                produce of the colony was to go into a common stock for five years,
                                and the emigrants, men without families, were thrown into a
                                semi-monastic trading community like the Hanseatic agencies of the
                                time, with the saving element of a strong authority left out. Better
                                devices for promoting indolence and aggravating the natural
                                proneness to dissension of men in hard circumstances could scarcely
                                have been hit upon. Anarchy and despotism are the inevitable
                                alternatives under such a communistic arrangement, and each of these
                                ensued in turn.</p>

                                was allowed for a day&apos;s ration. This was made into pottage
                                and served out at the rate of one small ladleful at each meal.
                                &quot;Our drink was water, our lodgings castles in the
                                air,&quot; says Smith. The misery was aggravated by a constant
                                fear of attack from the Indians, who had been repulsed in an
                                energetic assault made soon after the landing of the English. It was
                                necessary for each man to watch every third night &quot;lying on
                                the cold, bare ground,&quot; and this exposure in a fever swamp,

                                there were any conscience in men,&quot; says Percy, &quot;it
                                would make their hearts bleed to hear the pitiful murmurings and

                                president, Wingfield, a man of good intentions but with no talents
                                suitable to a place of such difficulty. Slowly, by one change and
                                then another, the leadership fell into the hands of Captain John
                                Smith. During the voyage he had drawn upon himself the jealousy of
                                the others, probably by his boastful and self-asserting habit of
                                speech. When the list of councilors, till then kept secret, was
                                opened at Jamestown and his name was found in it, he was promptly
                                excluded by his associates. It was only on the intercession of the
                                clergyman, Hunt, that he was at length admitted to the Council.</p>
                            <p>His paradoxical character has been much misunderstood. Those who
                                discredit the historical accuracy of Captain Smith&apos;s
                                narratives consider his deeds of no value. It is the natural result

                                cast into the rubbish heap of contempt <pb id="VAA2449-045" n="32"/>
                                along with his false pretensions. On the other hand, those who

                                </note> presents no insoluble enigma if we consider the forces of
                                nature and of habit underlying its manifestations. According to his
                                own highly colored narrative, he had fed his fervid imagination on
                                romances of chivalry. The first natural result in a youth so
                                energetic as he, was that he should set out to emulate the imaginary
                                heroes of whom he had read. It was equally a matter of course that a
                                man of his vanity should exaggerate his own adventures to the size
                                of those that had excited his admiration. The same romantic turn of
                                the imagination that sent him a-wandering after exploits in Flanders
                                and in the wars with the Turks, in Barbary, and in Ireland, made his
                                every adventure seem an exploit of heroic size. Such a man is
                                valuable when boldness and aggressive action are in request; to
                                relate facts where autobiography is involved he is little

                                amusement of the ladies; he was made captive by the Turks and
                                escaped by slaying his master with a flail; he encountered pirates;
                                in the plunder of a ship he secured by the grace of God a box of
                                jewels; and, to round <pb id="VAA2449-046" n="33"/> off his story,
                                he was beloved in romance fashion by a fair Turkish lady, one
                                Tragabigzanda; befriended by a Russian lady, the good Calamata; and,
                                later, was snatched from the open jaws of death by the devotion of
                                the lovely Princess Pocahontas, daughter of King Powhatan, of
                                Virginia. What more could one ask? Here are the elements of all the
                                romances. But, to crown all, he emulated the misadventure of the
                                prophet Jonah, and he even out-Jonahed Jonah. He got ashore by mere
                                swimming without the aid of a whale, when cast overboard by Catholic
                                pilgrims to appease a tempest. Never any other wanderer since the
                                safe return of Ulysses passed through such a succession of marvelous
                                escapes as this young John Smith. His accidents and achievements,
                                even without exaggeration, were fairly notable, doubtless, but they
                                are forever obscured by his vices of narration.</p>

                                of Ralegh&apos;s failures. That being the most difficult and
                                dangerous enterprise then in sight, nothing was more natural than
                                that Smith should embark in it. From this time to the end of his

                                resourceful. His recorded geographical observations are remarkably
                                accurate considering his circumstances, and his understanding of
                                Indian life shows his intelligence. His writings on practical
                                questions are terse, epigrammatic, and wise beyond the wisdom of his
                                time. But where his own adventures or credit are involved he is
                                hardly more trustworthy than Falstaff. His boasting is one of the

                                and magnitude in his memory. The apocryphal story of his expounding
                                the solar system by means of a pocket compass to savages whose idiom
                                he had had no opportunity to learn is to be found only in his later
                                writings. He is a prisoner but a month in the narrative of the
                                Oxford Tract of 1612, which was written by his associates and
                                published with his authority, but his captivity had grown to six or
                                seven weeks in the Generall Historie of 1624. His prosaic release by
                                Powhatan had developed into a romantic rescue by Pocahontas. Two or
                                three hundred savages in the earlier account become four or five
                                hundred in the later. Certain Poles assist him in the capture of an
                                Indian chief in the authorized narrative of Pots and Phettiplace. In
                                the later story our hero performs this feat single-handed. A mere
                                cipher attaches itself sometimes to the figure representing the
                                number of his enemies, who by this simple feat of memory become ten

                                published in his later years by way of advice on the subject of
                                colony-planting is full of admirable good sense. With rare foresight
                                he predicted the coming importance of the colonial trade and the
                                part to be played by the American fisheries in promoting the
                                greatness of England by &quot;breeding mariners.&quot; He
                                only of the men of his time suspected the imperial size and future
                                greatness of North America. He urged that the colonies should not
                                annoy &quot;with large pilotage and such like dues&quot;
                                those who came to trade in their ports. Low customs, he says, enrich
                                a people. This is a strange doctrine in an age when foreign trade
                                seemed almost an evil, and false conceptions of economic principles
                                were nearly universal. Captain Smith&apos;s words are often
                                pregnant with a wit whose pungency is delightful. In mental and

                                one who could carry on the difficult Indian trade. Ratcliffe, who
                                had conspired to send Smith back to England, fell into an ambuscade
                                while emulating Captain Smith&apos;s example in trading with
                                Powhatan. He was tortured to death by the Indian women, and only
                                fifteen of his fifty men got back to Jamestown. The brood hogs of
                                the colony were all eaten, the dogs came next, and then the horses,
                                which were to have stocked Virginia, were consumed to their very
                                hides. Rats, mice, and adders were relished when they were to be

                                days buried, and eaten &quot;by the poorer sort,&quot; their
                                consuming hunger not being embarrassed by the restraints of
                                gentility. From this horrible expedient it was but one step to the
                                digging up of their own dead for food. Famine-crazed men even dogged
                                the steps of those of their comrades who were not quite wasted,
                                threatening to kill and devour them. Among these despairing and
                                shiftless men there was but one man of resources. Daniel Tuckerlet
                                his later sins as tyrant of Bermuda be forgivenbethought himself to
                                build a boat to catch fish in the river, and this small relief
                                &quot;did keep us from killing one another to eat,&quot;
                                says Percy. He seems to have been the only man who bethought himself
                                to do anything. One man, in the ferocity engendered by famine,<note

                                her flesh, but he was put to death at the stake for this crime.
                                Some, braving the savages, sought food in the woods and died while
                                seeking it, and were eaten by those who found them dead. Others, in
                                sheer desperation, threw themselves on the tender mercies of the
                                Indians and were slain. To physical were added spiritual torments.
                                One despairing wretch threw his Bible into the fire, crying out in
                                the market place that there was no God in heaven. Percy adds, with
                                grim theological satisfaction characteristic of the time, that he
                                was killed by the Indians in the very <pb id="VAA2449-053" n="40"/>
                                market place where he had blasphemed in his agony. The depopulated
                                houses, and even the palisades so necessary for protection, were
                                burned for firewood by the enfeebled people, and Jamestown came
                                presently to look like the slumbering ruins of some ancient

                                that all who were shut up in the Jamestown peninsula should perish
                                of hunger in a very few days. Of the nearly five hundred colonists
                                in Virginia in the autumn of 1609, there were but sixty
                                famine-smitten wretches alive in the following June, and hardly one
                                of these could have survived had help been delayed a few days

                                extinction. Finding that their provisions would not last more than
                                two or three weeks, they abandoned the wreck of Jamestown, crowding
                                all the people into four pinnaces, including the two improvised

                                Virginia not exactly into a military camp, but rather into a penal
                                settlement where men suffered for the crime of emigration. The men
                                taken to Virginia in Dale&apos;s own company were hardly fit for
                                anything else, and were so &quot;diseased and crazed in their
                                bodies&quot; that at one time not more than sixty out of three

                                mutiny by the enforced toil and bad food. And mutiny and desertion
                                were usually but other names for suicide under the rule of the
                                pitiless high marshal. Some fled to the woods, hoping to reach a
                                mythical Spanish settlement believed to be not very far away. Dale
                                set the Indians on them, and they were brought back to be burned at
                                the stake. Others, who in desperation or deadly homesickness
                                resolved to venture their lives in a barge and a shallop
                                &quot;for their native country,&quot; suffered in various

                                One offender was put to death by the awful torture of breaking on
                                the wheel, a penalty that Dale may have learned during his stay on

                                not waste any sympathy on those who were hanged for stealing to
                                satisfy hunger; death is more merciful than life to men in such a
                                case. But one poor rogue, who thought to better his rations by
                                filching two or three pints of oatmeal, had a bodkin run through his
                                tongue and was chained to a tree until he perished of hunger. Though
                                these things were twice attested by the best men in the colony, one
                                prefers to make some allowance <pb id="VAA2449-060" n="47"/> for
                                their passionate resentment, and to hope that some of the horrors
                                related are exaggerated. It is hard to believe, for example, that
                                men unable to work were denied food, and left to creep away into the
                                wretched burrows in the ground used for shelter, there to die
                                unregarded in the general misery.</p>
                            <p>In 1612 a company of ten men sent out to catch fish braved the perils
                                of the ocean in a little bark and got back to England. It was the

                                closely made up in a garter, to avoid the vigilance of Sir Thomas
                                Dale.</p>

                                colony to any straits while he was in charge. He gave his first
                                attention to fortification, and he even begged for two thousand
                                convicts out of English jails to form a line of posts from Hampton
                                to a point a hundred miles above Jamestown. He sent Argall all the
                                way to Mount Desert to plunder a Jesuit settlement and make prize of
                                a French shipan undertaking congenial <pb id="VAA2449-061" n="48"/>
                                to Dale&apos;s military temper and the Viking tastes of Argall.
                                As his experience increased, Dale came to understand that other than
                                military measures were needed to found a colony, though he never
                                more than half comprehended the elements of the problem. In his
                                later time he cleared more corn ground, and he could boast at his
                                departure that Virginia contained six horses, a hundred and
                                forty-nine neat cattle, two hundred and sixteen goats, and hogs
                                without number. Dale set off a private garden of three acres of land
                                to each of the old planters, on the condition that they should
                                provide food for themselves while still giving nearly all of their
                                time to the service of the common stock. Even this
                                slave&apos;s-patch of private interest given to only a fraction
                                of the colonists put some life into Virginia; but two thirds of the
                                people were retained in the old intolerable bondage, and not even
                                the most favored secured personal ownership of land. Dale&apos;s
                                administration was remembered as &quot;the five years of

                                the country, and proved all by exhibiting &quot;at least sixteen
                                several sorts of staple commodities to be raised in this
                                plantation.&quot; For greater effect, samples of twelve of these
                                products of the colony were sold by public auction in the open court

                                which have never flourished in Virginia since his time, he left
                                behind him not an established community, but a mere camp of unhappy
                                men retained in the country by the sheer impossibility of

                                some three hundred and twenty-six men, twenty-five women and
                                children, and graves out-numbering many times over all the living
                                souls.</p>
                            <p>Three things had been discovered in Dale&apos;s time that were of
                                importance to the colony. Dale had by personal experiment learned
                                the two fishing seasons in the James River. The colonists had begun
                                the profitable cultivation of tobacco, and the economic success of
                                the colony was thereby assured. Lastly, even Dale&apos;s small
                                experiment with private interest rendered the apportionment of the
                                land and the establishment of private ownership certain to come in
                                time. As early as 1614 it was estimated that three men working for
                                themselves raised more corn than ten times as many when the<note

                                </note> Dale, was a bold and notable mariner. He had built the first
                                Virginia vessel; he had traded with the Indians for corn with as
                                much enterprise and address as Captain Smith had shown; he had in a
                                small ship called the Dainty made the first experimental voyage to
                                James River by the westward route, avoiding the long circuit by the
                                Canaries and West Indies. It had been his fortune to be the first
                                Englishman to see the American bison, which he found near the
                                Potomac. He it was who by a shrewd trick had captured Pocahontas and
                                held her as hostage; and he drove the French out of Maine,
                                despoiling their settlement at Mount Desert. To a mastery of all the
                                arts that make the skillful navigator he added the courteous

                                pirate. As governor, he robbed the company with one hand and the
                                hapless colonists with the other. While using the ships and men of
                                the colony to carry on the Indian trade, he turned all the profits
                                of it into his own wallet. The breeding animals of the colony
                                accumulated by Dale he sold, and made no account of the proceeds.
                                There was hardly anything portable or salable in Virginia that he
                                did not purloin. He even plundered the property of Lady De la Warr,
                                the widow of his predecessor. He boldly fitted out a ship belonging
                                to Lord Rich, and sent an expedition of <pb id="VAA2449-064" n="51"

                                his downfall was imminent, he forthwith redoubled his felonious

                                within Virginia which should be exempt from all authority of the
                                company and the colony. This independent government was to serve as
                                a refuge from prosecutions for Argall and other piratical agents,
                                and at last to possess itself of the wreck and remainder of
                                Virginia. The second step in this intrigue was one that could have
                                availed nothing in any time less respectful to shadowy
                                technicalities and less prone to legal chicanery than that of James

                                with a foreign princess without the consent of his sovereign. If
                                this had any foundation, it grew out of the value of a pretext in a
                                time of technicality and intrigue. There may have been already a
                                scheme to trade upon the hereditary right of Powhatan&apos;s
                                daughter. Pocahontas died in England, leaving an infant son. Argall,
                                on his arrival, hastened to notify the company that Opechankano, the
                                brother and successor of Powhatan, had resolved not to sell any more
                                land, but to reserve it for the son of Pocahontas when he should be
                                grown. The company charged that this was a ruse to serve the ends
                                which Argall, Rich, and others had in view. The larger plan
                                miscarried, but Argall found his prey so tempting that he lingered
                                longer than was safe, and got away in the nick of time by the aid of
                                Lord Rich, who had stood guard like a burglar&apos;s pal, and

                                Company, acting within the powers conferred on it by its charter,
                                granted to the residents in Virginia a document styled a
                                &quot;Great Charter or Commissions of Priviledges, Orders, and
                                Lawes.&quot; No copy of this instrument now exists, but some of
                                its provisions have been preserved. It established a legislative
                                body, to consist of councilors of estate and of representatives or
                                burgesses chosen by the several &quot;plantations&quot; or
                                hundreds, and it limited the power of the governor. This charter was
                                the starting point of constitutional government in the New World. It
                                contained in embryo the American system of an executive power lodged

                                </note> a colony of bachelors can hardly found a state. The first
                                ship laden with home-makers carried over ninety maids, and the
                                company thought it necessary to promise special rewards to the men
                                who should marry these young women. If the maids were as certified,
                                &quot;young, handsome, and well recommended,&quot; they
                                needed no such dowry in a land that had hardly a woman in it. Young
                                or old, handsome or homely, the maids did not prove a drug. Shipload
                                after shipload of them were eagerly bought by the planters, who had
                                to pay a round sum in the high-priced tobacco of that early time to
                                defray the cost of transporting these wives. Besides having to pay
                                for his wife, the planter could have her only on the condition of
                                winning her consent; and the eager courtship that ensued on the
                                arrival of a shipload of maids must have been one of the most
                                amusing scenes in the settlement of America. Suitors far outnumbered
                                the women, and the latter had things pretty much their own way. The
                                first cargo of this interesting merchandise was landed in 1619, but
                                as late as 1624 the women were probably in danger of setting the
                                colonists by the ears, for the governor felt obliged <pb

                                person at a time. In 1632, thirteen years after the<note

                                with women sent in the same fashion. In that year, two, whose
                                behavior during the voyage had been disgraceful, were sent back as
                                unfit to be mothers of Virginians. The precaution could not have
                                been of much practical use, but it indicates the early growth of a
                                wholesome local pride. When there were house mothers in the cabins,
                                and children born in the country, the settlers no longer dreamed of
                                returning to England; and there was soon a young generation that
                                knew no other skies than those that spanned the rivers, fields, and
                                vast primeval forests of their native Virginia, which now for the
                                first time became a home.</p>

                                </note> seen in the crucible. The fate of English colonization was
                                no doubt settled by the experiments made during the first years on
                                the James River, and the story told in this chapter is but the
                                overture to the whole history of life in the United States. In our
                                colonizing age a settlement might be made in the heart of Africa
                                with a far smaller loss of life than was incurred in the first
                                sixteen years in Virginia. From 1607 to 1623 there were landed in
                                Virginia more than six thousand people. The number that <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-072" n="59"/> returned to England was
                                inconsiderable, but in the year 1624, when the colony passed under a
                                royal government, there remained alive in the colony only twelve
                                hundred and seventy-five. Of those who came in these early years
                                four fifths perished. A part of this loss was due to radically wrong
                                conceptions of the nature, end, and proper methods of colonization,
                                a part to corrupt and incompetent management in the London Company.
                                The bad character of many of the earliest emigrants was one cause of
                                difficulty. The writers of the time probably exaggerated this evil
                                in order to excuse the severity of the government and the miseries
                                into which the settlers fell. But the loss of many of the early
                                comers must be accounted a distinct gain to Virginia. Unfitted for
                                their environment, they were doomed to extinction by that pitiless
                                law which works ever to abolish from the earth the improvident, the
                                idle, and the vicious.</p>

                                mainland. This bit of sand, in the antique phrase of one of the
                                early colonists, was &quot;no broader than a man may well quaite
                                a tileshard.&quot; Strachey, in Purchas, p. 1752. Jamestown is
                                now a farm; the ruins of the church and many of the tombs in the
                                eighteenth-century churchyard remain; but the upper end of the
                                island is wearing away, and I picked out of the crumbling sand, far
                                from the later burying place, human bones of earlier burials,
                                possibly of the victims of the famines and epidemics. The walls of
                                the magazine had been exposed by erosion. I brought away <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-073" n="60"/> wrought nails, bits of glass grown
                                iridescent from long burial, and an exploded bombshell of so small a
                                caliber as to mark its antiquity. By the aid of a negro youth living
                                on the farm I found the hearth bricks turned up in various places by
                                the plow, and the arrangement, or rather lack of arrangement, of the
                                town could thus be made out. My guide volunteered the information
                                that Jamestown was &quot;the first place discovered after the

                                matter of dispute. Both accounts are correct, as is shown by the
                                testimony of an important manuscript at Petworth House, in Surrey,
                                which I was allowed to examine by the courtesy of Lord Leconsfield.
                                It is from the pen of George Percy, a brother of the Earl of
                                Northumberland, who was chosen to succeed Smith on his departure
                                from the colony. It is not the narrative from which Purchas makes
                                extracts, but a sequel to it. The title is &quot;A Trewe
                                Relacyon of the pceedinge and Ocvrrentes of momente wch have hapned
                                in Virginia from the Tyme Sr Thomas Gates was shipwrackde vpon the

                                Ano Dni 1612.&quot; It is a quarto of forty-one pages. Percy was
                                a man of courage, but his own narrative in this little book shows
                                that he had no qualification for the office of governor except the
                                rank of his family. His ill health is made an excuse for his
                                inefficiency, but Dale&apos;s letter of May 25, 1611, shows that
                                even the horrible events of Percy&apos;s first government had
                                not taught him to plant corn when again left in charge. Percy
                                naturally resents Smith&apos;s boast-fulness, and bluntly
                                accuses him of laying claim to credit that was not his. The charge
                                that Smith, unable to control the unruly settlers at the Falls under
                                West, advised the Indians to attack them, is supported by Percy; and
                                a very different charge, that he stirred up the Indians to
                                assassinate West himself, appears at a later time in
                                Spelman&apos;s Relation, a tract that bears abundant internal
                                evidence of the writer&apos;s mental inability to speak the
                                truth. Percy himself relates that the Indians were already hostile
                                to West&apos;s party, and that they had wounded and killed some
                                of West&apos;s men in resentment of their wanton outrages. See
                                also the account in the Oxford Tract, with the signatures <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-074" n="61"/> of Pots and Phettiplace, for
                                Smith&apos;s version of the affair.
                                &quot;Bloody-mindedness&quot; seems not to have been a trait
                                of Smith. But the exigency was a terrible one, for death by
                                starvation was already impending, and only the restoration of
                                discipline at any cost could have saved the colony from the horrible
                                fate it met. Such a course would not have done much violence to the

                                plots against the lives of Smith, Wingfield, and others in the
                                colony. It is quite probable, however, that there is no truth in the
                                story. The violent hatred of the factions will account for the
                                suspicion.</p>

                                commonly referred to as the Oxford Tract. Its proper title is very
                                long. The first part of it is as follows: &quot;Map of Virginia,
                                with a description of the Covntry, the Commodities, People,
                                Government, and Religion. Written by Captain Smyth, sometime
                                Governor of the Covntry. And wherevnto is annexed the proceedings of
                                those colonies since their first departure from England,&quot;
                                etc. The second part of the book professes to be taken from the
                                writings of eight of the colonists, whose names are given, and to
                                have been edited by W. S.that is, the Reverend Dr. Symonds. A
                                history of Virginia was first proposed in a well-considered speech
                                by &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; at a meeting of the Virginia
                                Company, April 12, 1621. This seems to have been not Captain Smith,
                                but John Smith of Nibley. He suggested the writing of a history to
                                preserve the memory of the worthies of Virginia, dead and living,
                                and gave it as his opinion that no Spanish settlement of the same
                                age afforded matter more interesting. &quot;Which worthy
                                speech,&quot; says the record,&quot; had of the whole court
                                a very great applause as spoken freely to a speciall purpose, and
                                therefore thought fitt to be considered and put in practice in his
                                due time. And for which also Mr. Smyth as preferring allwaies
                                mocions of speciall consequence was exceedingly commended.&quot;
                                MS. Records of the Virginia Company, i, 197-200. We have no means of
                                knowing whether or not this suggestion had any relation to the
                                production of Captain John Smith&apos;s Generall Historie, the
                                first edition of which appeared in 1624, the last two editions in
                                1632. The book is a compilation of Smith&apos;s earlier works,
                                somewhat expanded, not to say inflated. The later portions are
                                mostly made up from the official and <hi rend="i"
                                >quasi</hi>-official pamphlets. Just what was Dr. Symonds&apos;s

                                    n="62"/> and the Generall Historie it would be interesting to
                                know. Its descriptive portions are of high value, and we are now
                                able to control its historical errors to a certain extent. Besides
                                these three works on Virginia, Smith published a Description of New
                                England, 1616, New England&apos;s Trials, 1620, and
                                Advertisements for the Unexperienced Planters of New England or
                                Elsewhere, in 1631, the year of his death. These all contain
                                valuable matter relating, to Virgini. He also published in 1627 two
                                works on seamanship, a Sea Grammar, and the Accidence or Pathway to
                                Experience necessary for a Young Seaman. In 1630 he published his
                                True Travels, a book which contains an account of his own adventures
                                previous to his going to Virginia. More than a quarter of a century
                                had elapsed between the occurrence of these adventures and their
                                publication. Smith&apos;s vivid imagination had meantime no
                                doubt greatly magnified his own exploits. It is quite impossible at
                                this day to sift what truth there is in the True Travels from the
                                exaggerations. Travelers in that time were not held to a very rigid
                                account, and their first obligation seems to have been to amuse
                                their readers. No distinct line had yet been drawn in literature
                                between fact and fiction.</p>
                            <p>Many years ago, before I had had an opportunity to examine and
                                compare all his writings, I rashly printed a brief argument in favor
                                of the trustworthiness of Captain John Smith and the credibility of
                                the Pocahontas story. I believe no person of critical judgment can
                                make a thorough comparison of Smith&apos;s successive books
                                without being convinced of the ineradicable tendency of his mind to
                                romance in narrating adventure, especially his own adventure. Even
                                his style where his vanity speaks loses something of its native
                                directness and force. His practical writings on navigation and on
                                the proper conduct of colonization, and his descriptions of the
                                country and the savages, are plain, direct, and lucid. His personal
                                morals were probably unexceptionable. One of his associates
                                certifies to his freedom from tobacco, wines, dice, debts, and
                                oaths. But a comparison between the statements made in the Oxford
                                Tract and those in the Generall Historie leaves upon the mind of the
                                critic a distinct impression of the very processes by which his
                                adventures were exaggerated in his own memory as time elapsed. The
                                three or four hundred savages on the Potomac (Oxford Tract, p. 32, a
                                sufficiently marvelous story) rise to three or four thousand in the
                                Generall Historie. Pocahontas becomes the central figure in
                                incidents as told in 1624 in which she had no place in 1612. There
                                is but one allusion <pb id="VAA2449-076" n="63"/> to Pocahontas in
                                the entire Oxford Tract p. 103), and that has to do with the charge
                                that Smith intended to marry her. A just and witty judgment of
                                Captain Smith was made almost in his own time by Thomas Fuller. He
                                says: &quot;Such his perils, preservations, dangers,
                                deliverances, they seem to most men beyond belief, to some beyond
                                truth. Yet we have two witnesses to attest them, the prose and the
                                pictures, both in his own book; and it soundeth much to the
                                diminution of his deeds that he alone is the herald to publish and
                                proclaim them. . . . However, moderate men must allow Captain Smith
                                to have been very instrumental in settling the plantation in
                                Virginia, whereof he was Governor, as also admiral of New
                                England.&quot; Fuller&apos;s Worthies, edition of 1840, i,
                                276. Those who desire to see an ingenious and learned defense of
                                Captain Smith, particularly in the matter of the Pocahontas story,
                                will find it in an address by Mr. William Wirt Henry, published by
                                the Virginia Historical Society. Prof. Arber&apos;s discussion
                                of the subject in his edition of Smith&apos;s Works is
                                sentimental rather than critical. Compare Deane&apos;s Wingfield
                                for the other side. Unnecessary heat has characterized some of the
                                debates about John Smith. History pitched in a shrill polemical key
                                is not instructive and is something less than amusing. These debates
                                center themselves on the Pocahontas story, which is of little
                                historical importance except as it involves the trust-worthiness of
                                Smith&apos;s narrative.</p>
                            <p>The conduct of Captain Smith in the Virginia colony will be better
                                understood if we appreciate the character of his principal opponent,
                                Gabriel Archer. Archer&apos;s return to Virginia in 1609 and his
                                agency in overthrowing Captain Smith are alluded to apparently in a
                                passage in the New Life of Virginea, 1612, &quot;In which
                                distemper that envious man stept in, sowing plentifull tares in the
                                hearts of all,&quot; etc. One of Archer&apos;s schemes seems
                                to have been to establish a parliament and a complicated government
                                at the beginning. Purchas and Strachey both take sides against
                                Archer in his controversy with Smith. Purchas, iv, p. 1749, Oxford
                                Tract, 22. Wingfield warned Newport of the danger of disturbance
                                from Archer, who was &quot;troubled with an ambitious
                                spirit.&quot; Wingfield&apos;s Discourse, 77, 94, 95.
                                Wingfield also says, &quot;In all their disorders was Mr. Archer
                                a ringleader.&quot; He adds that Radcliffe &quot;did wear no
                                other eies or eares than grew on Mr. Archer&apos;s
                                head.&quot; For a bibliographical account of Smith&apos;s
                                works the reader is referred to the valuable notes in Mr.
                                Winsor&apos;s Narrative and Critical History of America, vol.

                            <p>In the note above, as it appeared in the first impression of this
                                volume, I attributed to Captain John Smith certain speeches and
                                motions made by a Mr. John Smyth or Smith in the Virginia Company.
                                Those who had examined the Manuscript Records before me had made the
                                same attribution. But soon after the appearance of this volume I met
                                by accident with Quaritch&apos;s Rough List No. 87, and from the
                                list of papers of John Smith of Nibley therein it became probable
                                that he and not the unfortunate Captain Smith had made these wise
                                speeches.</p>

                                dead victims with mussel shells. Percy seems to have retaliated in a
                                way to exasperate without disabling the savages. He &quot;burned
                                their hawses, Ransacked their Temples, tooke downe the corpses off
                                their deade Kings from off their Toambes [that is, the scaffold on
                                which their well-dried remains were deposited], and caryed away
                                their pearles, caps, and bracelets wherewith they doe decore their
                                Kings fvneralls.&quot; (For this sacred house thus desecrated by
                                Percy the Indians had such reverence that none but priests and
                                chiefs were allowed to enter, and the Indians never ventured to pass
                                it without casting some offering of tobacco, wampum, copper, or
                                puccoon root into the water.Strachey, 90.) When Percy had captured a
                                chief&apos;s wife and children, the soldiers in revengeful
                                wantonness, according to Percy&apos;s account, threw the
                                children out of the boat and shot them in the water. The inefficient
                                Percy was able to save the life of the &quot;queen&quot; or
                                chief&apos;s wife with difficulty. West and Ratcliffe, who had
                                overthrown Smith, are accused by Percy of unnecessary cruelty to the
                                savages. West sailed away in the ship, leaving Jamestown to its
                                fate. Ratcliffe was put to death with exquisite tortures. There is
                                no doubt some truth, as there is certainly jealousy, in
                                Percy&apos;s charge that Captain Smith was &quot;an
                                ambitious, unworthy, and vainglorious fellow, attempting to take all
                                men&apos;s authorities from them,&quot; but he was neither
                                weak, like Percy and Ratcliffe, nor visionary, like the gold-hunting
                                Martin and the doctrinary and demagogical Archer, nor treacherous
                                and cruel, like West. With all his faults he only was master of the
                                situation in these early years. Percy admits that the lawful
                                authority was that of Smith. The history of the government of Percy
                                and his supporters seems to justify Smith&apos;s refusal to
                                share his lawful power with incompetent factionaries.</p>

                                and it was from him that the islands took the name of Somers or

                                shipwrecked party. The Rev. Joseph Hunter has written with much
                                learning, patient research, and fatiguing prolixity to disprove the
                                theory that Shakespeare&apos;s Tempest was suggested by the
                                wreck of Gates and Somers. He succeeds in showing its relation to
                                another occurrence, but works of imagination do not usually have
                                their origin in a single fact, and it is hard to resist the
                                conviction that the Tempest, as we have it, contains more than one
                                allusion to the wreck upon &quot;the still vexed

                                </note> 1624, manuscripts in the British Public Record Office, are
                                the most important authorities for the facts given in the text. The
                                Briefe Declaration is rather the fuller, but the earlier paper
                                supplies some particulars. These two formal documents are not from
                                the same hand, and the slight difference between them in details
                                tends rather to confirm than to shake the reader&apos;s
                                confidence in their testimony. The names of Sir Francis Wyatt,
                                George Sandys, and other prominent colonists appended to the
                                Tragicall Relation are a guarantee of its good faith. It is curious
                                to note that Raphe Hamor, whose relation is so favorable to Dale,
                                and who held the post of secretary under Dale and that of
                                vice-admiral under Argall, signs this paper, which is a severe
                                impeachment of Sir Thomas Smythe&apos;s administration of the
                                affairs of the company before 1619. Hamor&apos;s True Discourse
                                has heretofore usually been taken as an authority, but after reading
                                the documents in the Public Record Office one is compelled to
                                believe that Hamor, or perhaps one might say Dale, under cover of
                                his secretary, misrepresents the state of the colony, and makes
                                promises to those who may emigrate that it was hardly possible to
                                carry out. The Discourse of the old Virginia Company (Colonial
                                Papers, iii, 40), and other papers in the Public Record Office
                                relating to the strife between the company and the Court, throw
                                light on this period. The half-apologies for Dale&apos;s
                                cruelties in Smith&apos;s Generall Historie, book iv, prove
                                their existence. &quot;For amongst them, so hardened in
                                evil,&quot; says this writer, &quot;the fear of a cruel,
                                painful, and unusual death more restrains them than death
                                itself.&quot; See also Hamor, p. 27. There is a letter from
                                Whitaker appended to Hamor&apos;s Discourse. Though apparently
                                an incidental letter, it bears marks of having been procured for
                                purposes of vindication. Its defensive tone goes to show that the
                                character of Dale&apos;s tyranny had transpired in England.
                                Whitaker praises Sir Thomas Dale mainly for being religious and
                                valiant, and says that he had &quot;great knowledge in Divinity
                                and good conscience in all his doings; both which bee rare in a
                                martiall man.&quot; In Whitaker&apos;s Good Newes of
                                Virginia, 1613, there is no praise of Sir Thomas Dale. That Dale was
                                famous for his severity before he left Europe is manifest from the
                                phrase used by the Jesuit Biard, &quot;Le Mareschal Thomas Deel
                                que vous auez ouy estre fort aspre en ses humeurs.&quot;
                                Relation, chap. xxxiii. <pb id="VAA2449-080" n="67"/> See in this
                                and the preceding chapter the whole account of his savage temper
                                toward his French prisoners, etc. It has been the custom of our
                                older writers to speak of Dale&apos;s administration only in
                                praise, but careful weighing of the original authorities shows that
                                Dale was utterly pitiless in the cruelty of his discipline and
                                unjust in his detention of the old planters, and that when he left
                                the colony he was more generally execrated than any other man that
                                ruled in these early days, not even excepting his successor, Argall.
                                Dale&apos;s severity was serviceable in carrying the enterprise
                                through straits, but the reports of his harshness brought the colony
                                into disrepute and checked immigration. The detestation of Dale was
                                shared by the best men in Virginia, yet it is to be remembered that
                                the savagery of Dale&apos;s government was due not wholly to the
                                brutal temper of the man, but partly to the age and the school in
                                which he had been bred. Legal torture was in use long after this.
                                The Clarendon Papers, quoted by Southey, state that at
                                Henley-on-Thames, as late as 1646, it was ordered that a
                                woman&apos;s tongue should be nailed to a tree for complaining
                                of the tax levied by Parliament. The cruel practices of the agents
                                of the Virginia Company are paralleled by those of the East India
                                Company at the same time. &quot;Before they were intrusted with
                                martial law they made it a rule to whip to death or starve to death
                                those of whom they wished to get rid.&quot; Mills, British
                                India, i, 38. Even that champion of popular liberty, Sir Edwin
                                Sandys, found it in his heart to approve of Dale&apos;s course
                                while admitting its harshness. He said to the court of the Virginia
                                Company of the 17th of November, 1619, that &quot;Sir Thomas
                                Dale, building upon these foundations with great and constant
                                severity, reclaymed almost miraculously those idle and disordered
                                people, and reduced them to labor and an honest fashion of
                                life.&quot; MS. Records of the Virginia Company. Compare also

                                come from Virginia, and brings word that plantation will fall to the
                                ground if it be not presently supplied. He speaks of wonderful
                                commodities that are to be had there if we could but have patience
                                and would be at the cost to bring them to perfection.&quot; Out
                                of this necessity for some present support came the great lottery.
                                It was recommended by the Privy Council to the Mayor of Canterbury,
                                February 22, 1615. There was a &quot;running lottery&quot;
                                of smaller adventures in Paul&apos;s Churchyard before the
                                &quot;great standing lottery&quot; was instituted, and then
                                there were other &quot;running lotteries&quot; &quot;in
                                many other places after.&quot; Purchas, p. 1773. No doubt there
                                were corruptions and abuses in these lotteries. The merchants
                                prospered while Virginia languished. Its unpopularity is attributed

                                Record Office. It was not, indeed, the government by martial law,
                                but Dale&apos;s abuse of his power, that wrought the mischief.
                                After the emancipation the old settlers lived in perpetual terror

                                The news that Sir George Yeardley did bring was no doubt that the
                                power of Sir Thomas Smythe and his party was broken, and that the
                                actual control of affairs was in the hands of such men as Sandys,
                                Southampton, Cavendish, Danvers, and the two Ferrars. The whole
                                policy of the company indicates that the new party was really in
                                power, and the appointment of such a man as Yeardley was probably
                                the work of the rising party. The records before the resignation of
                                Sir Thomas Smythe were probably destroyed for purposes of
                                concealment.</p>

                                the same expedient, as is well known, was resorted to in Canada. In
                                Virginia more pains were taken to have all the women thus imported
                                of a good character than in some of the French colonies.</p>

                                7, 1620, Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company). He says,
                                &quot;These people (including the maids) are to be provided as
                                they have formerly beene, partlie by printed publication of the

                                The notion that some of the maidens were pressed seems to have had
                                its rise in the counterfeiting of the great seal and the issuing of
                                forged commissions to press maidens for &quot;breeders for the
                                King&quot; in the Bermudas and Virginia in order to extort
                                money. One Owen Evans was accused of such practices in October, 1618
                                (Sainsbury, p. 19), and one Robinson was hanged, drawn, and
                                quartered for this or similar offences in November of the same year
                                (Birch&apos;s Court of James I, 108). In order to encourage the
                                adventurers or shareholders to subscribe to the sending of maids, a
                                town was laid off in Virginia to be called Maydstown. The
                                subscribers were to be allowed shares in this town. Manuscript

                                not been in use in recent times for reference. Its origin is
                                uncertain, nor can the authorities of the library tell where it
                                from. It was compiled in the latter part of the seventeenth century,
                                judging from internal evidence, and was perhaps kept among the
                                records of the colony for reference on what we should call
                                constitutional questions. I found a loose memorandum laid in its

                                mistake lay in the main purpose. If the founding of a state had been
                                other than a secondary and remote end, the managers might have sent
                                at first families and not bachelors, farmers and not gentlemen,
                                laborers and not riff-raff. But more visionary motives dominated the
                                action. A state was planted, but something else was mainly intended
                                by the first projectors. The work seemed continuous, but the end in
                                view shifted and the actors gradually changed. The only motive that
                                held from first to last, and ran through all the rest, was the
                                rivalry with Spain.</p>

                                Ralegh was a lifelong opponent in peace and war of Spanish intrigue
                                and aggression, and his efforts to plant colonies in the virgin land
                                were suggested by a <pb id="VAA2449-087" n="74"/> knowledge of the
                                almost exhaustless treasure that flowed into Spanish coffers from
                                America. The opportune capture of a Spanish carack bound home-ward
                                from Mexico with letters describing the wealth of Mexican mines
                                brought the support of English merchants to Ralegh&apos;s

                                wrote from Roanoke Island in 1585 that his colony would be a means

                                pure fable were potent attractions for some time after. The gradual

                                by getting money from abroad and keeping it at home. The precious
                                metals constituted the only recognized riches. Laws were made to
                                restrain the exportation of gold and silver, and sumptuary laws to

                                in the north of France. Mulberries were first planted in England in
                                1608, two years after the sailing of the Virginia argonauts. James
                                sent circulars to persons of influence among his subjects asking
                                them to cultivate mulberry trees, and, in the years immediately
                                following, the silk fever ran its course alongside the excitement
                                about the great lottery in behalf of the Virginia colony. Hakluyt,
                                spreading sails for America in every breeze, hastened to announce at

                            <p>The first principles that govern colony-planting were not yet
                                understood. It was proposed to force everything from a forlorn camp
                                of men dwelling under roofs of bark and sedge, environed by
                                treacherous foes and in constant peril of starvation. The raising of
                                silkworms was begun in Virginia in 1613, and before the colony was
                                nine years old it was <pb id="VAA2449-090" n="77"/> able to send to
                                England silk that doubtless had cost more than a hundred times its
                                market value. The experiment came to nothing. It could not have

                                of cloth.&quot; This rage for silk led to the establishment of
                                silk manufacturing in England; throwsters, dyers, and weavers were
                                brought to England from abroad and settled in Spitalfields,
                                &quot;the cheap end of its metropolis,&quot; and in
                                Moorfields. It seemed more than ever important to produce silk in
                                the king&apos;s dominions, in order to supply these
                                manufacturers with material without importation from alien lands.
                                Accordingly, a new effort was made in 1620 to secure raw silk from
                                Virginia. The Earl of Southampton, ever eager to promote the
                                Virginia colony, &quot;writt into Italy, France, and
                                Spayne&quot; for silkworm &quot;seed&quot;; the king
                                gave some from his own stock, and the expert who had charge of the
                                king&apos;s worms was sent over to look after the business. A
                                French book on the subject was translated to instruct the colonists.

                                projects. The real doom of silk-raising, however, came from the fact
                                that the culture of tobacco in virgin soil was incalculably more
                                profitable and vastly less troublesome to pioneers than hatching

                                than an ungenial climate. But a lesson in economic principles is one
                                of the hardest for men to learn. Long after the colony had become
                                prosperous, English projectors and Virginia experimenters tried
                                again and again to supplant tobacco with silk. If we may credit the
                                report, Virginia furnished a coronation robe of silk for Charles I,
                                and Charles II certainly wore silk from worms hatched and fed in his
                                Virginia dominions. One Esquire Digges brought Armenians to Virginia

                                available at first, and it became necessary to request that sand
                                might be sent from England to make Virginia glass of at the glass
                                works in the woods near Jamestown. The German glass blowers were
                                prone to run away to the Indians, among whom work was lighter and
                                food more abundant. The tribesmen encouraged these desertions by
                                providing dusky wives for the men whose skill with tools and weapons
                                they valued highly. In 1621 the glass business was revived, and this

                                The people who survived the massacre were decimated by an epidemic
                                in the following year. What strength they could spare from frequent

                                much poetic sentiment had been lavished. Neither gold nor spices
                                came as had been expected; the strings of pearls seen by
                                Ralegh&apos;s men were not again to be found, or were perhaps
                                transformed on investigation into wampum beads; the silver mine once
                                discovered on the upper James had vanished forever; tropical fruits
                                refused to grow; even madder and woad failed, and, though the indigo
                                plant would readily mature, nobody knew how to manu-facture the dye.
                                Silk was troublesome and unprofitable, shipbuilding, and such coarse
                                but patriotic products as naval stores had come to naught. But the
                                detestable &quot;weed,&quot; as King James had dubbed it,
                                throve apace. As early as 1617 the waste margins of the broad
                                streets of Jamestown were planted with it by the eager settlers. The
                                English merchants grasped at the profits of it, the farmers of the
                                customs rejoiced in the heavy duties imposed on it, and a powerful

                                </note> established. By 1624, when the Virginia Company was
                                dissolved, the danger that the colony would be abandoned as a result
                                of Spanish intrigues, Indian massacres, or prolonged discouragement
                                had passed away. Public spirit, patriotism, and religious enthusiasm
                                no longer guarded it as a feeble house plant. It had struck root in
                                the outdoor soil of human self-interest and its life was assured.
                                From that time the colony that had been for seventeen years a

                                </note> have traced what may be called the series of commercial
                                motives that, sometimes in succession, often in co-operation,
                                propelled the Virginia movement. The agitation for a colony was
                                primarily a commercial one. The London or Virginia Company by which
                                it was carried forward had been organized in the form of the great
                                trading corporations of the time, such as the Muscovy Company and
                                the East India Company, and it was expected to yield large returns.
                                But though commercial in form and purpose, the Virginia Company from
                                the outset was able to appeal successfully in every emergency to
                                motives that were far from mercenary. Into the chain-threads of
                                commercial enterprise was woven a woof of patriotic feeling and
                                religious sentiment.</p>

                                reach of voracious noblemen like Warwick. More and more it passed
                                into the hands of the great liberal statesmen whose leader was the
                                incorruptible Sir Edwin Sandys, a man of rare gifts and knowledge
                                and of great resoluteness. These men had suffered some
                                disappointment, no doubt, in their struggle for parliamentary
                                freedom in England. They might have succeeded better had their
                                antagonist been a strong king, but against the pusillanimity, the
                                vanity, the vacillation, and the pedantic dogmatism of James little
                                permanent headway could be made. Without relinquishing the conflict
                                in the House of Commons, they took it up in the Quarter Courts of
                                the Virginia Company. In this new field they found themselves afresh
                                confronted by the obstinacy of the king, who was stirred up to
                                oppose them by the discarded governor, Sir Thomas Smyth, and his
                                friends, by Warwick, and by all the partisans of high prerogative

                                told the king that it was time for him to look into the Virginia

                                order to found a democratic state there. In 1619 Sir Thomas Smyth
                                tendered his resignation, and the company, to his surprise, it would
                                appear, accepted it, and chose Sandys to his place. When, in 1620,
                                his first year of government drew to a close, Sir Edwin Sandys
                                erected an elegant ballot-box in the midst of the hall of the

                                expressed his aversion. Southampton, braving the king&apos;s
                                displeasure, allowed himself to <pb id="VAA2449-102" n="89"/> be
                                elected, with Sandys for deputy. In June, 1621, both Southampton and
                                Sandys were imprisoned. This attracted attention to Virginia as a

                                the next two years. Even before the massacre and pestilence of 1622
                                and 1623, Southampton was assured by friends at court that it would
                                come to &quot;push of pike,&quot; and that the company would
                                be overthrown.<note id="note_241" place="right" anchored="yes">

                                English statesmen, at the head of which, and easily first, was Sir

                                English church caught its first missionary impulse. The Indian
                                captives brought from America at various times gave to Englishmen
                                    <pb id="VAA2449-103" n="90"/> the novel sight of men and women
                                from beyond the bounds of Christendom; people who had never been
                                baptized, and had never learned to wear English garments,
                                &quot;naked slaves of the devil,&quot; as one of the early
                                Virginia clergymen described them. To the benevolent desire of
                                Englishmen for the deliverance of the savages from devil-worship and
                                semi-nudity, there was added the natural wish for ecclesiastical
                                extension. The separation of England from the Roman hierarchy had
                                been a blow to the aspiration for an unattainable catholicity
                                cherished in one form or another by Christian ecclesiastics of
                                almost every school. It was not possible that the great men who were
                                leaders of the English church in the reigns of Elizabeth and James
                                should be content with the narrow limits of &quot;the little

                                in America. English ecclesiastics felt keenly the reproach made

                                shining in a dark place indeed. He bore with unfaltering courage and
                                a sweet-hearted patience rarely equaled in the history of martyrdom
                                the accumulating miseries of Jamestown, until he also perished in
                                the general mortality. His nobleness of spirit softened the
                                detestable rivalries of the early leaders. The most active and
                                influential <pb id="VAA2449-104" n="91"/> writers in favor of
                                colonization were clergymen such as Hakluyt, Symonds, Purchas, and
                                Crashaw. Other clergymen, following in the footsteps of Hunt, risked
                                life itself in the Virginia colony, while devout laymen spent their
                                money in its behalf. Thus did Anglican zeal further a colonization
                                that, by a curious perversity of outcome, resulted in founding a

                                Company were held for years. The two sons of this Nicholas Ferrar,
                                John and Nicholas, served in turn as deputy governors of the
                                Virginia Company. This pious Ferrar family, as it became
                                influential, lent to the scheme of colonizing Virginia something of
                                the air of a project for propagating the gospel. Nicholas, the
                                father, gave money for the education of infidels in Virginia. A
                                school was founded there by the gifts of the pious, and rewards were
                                given to those colonists who would educate Indian children in their
                                families. After the younger Nicholas, who was a man of remarkable
                                zeal and activity, tinged with a romantic enthusiasm, became deputy
                                in 1622, the production of silk and wine and iron and the educating
                                of Indians in Christianity traveled on abreast. A college was
                                proposed, for which an endowment of thirteen hundred pounds was
                                collected, and to which a valuable library was bequeathed by a
                                settler. <pb id="VAA2449-105" n="92"/> Practical men grumbled at the
                                prematurity of all this, and complained of those in charge that
                                &quot;they spent Michaelmas rent in mid-summer moone.&quot;
                                The governor of the colony, honest Sir Francis Wyatt, wished that

                            <p>The horrible massacre of March, 1622, made the Indian question
                                something other than the Ferrars saw it. All schemes for educating
                                the savages were obliterated in a day. The only thought after this
                                was how to put the savages to death, old and young, men and women,
                                more often by foul means than by fair. The settlers even emulated,
                                if they did not surpass, the treachery of the Indians. With the

                                on the age of colony beginnings. Rejecting the offer of a rich
                                bride, he bought for his mother, now a widow, the manor lordship of
                                Little Gidding, in Huntingdonshire, and took the entire Ferrar
                                family, including his brother and his sister with eighteen children,
                                into religious retirement. Here this half-domestic, half-monastic
                                community gave alms to the poor, illuminated manuscripts <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-106" n="93"/> of the Bible, and worshiped in its
                                little chapel with genuflections and other observances that procured
                                for it the nickname of the &quot;Protestant Nunnery,&quot;
                                and brought down upon it the pious fury of the Puritans. Nicholas
                                Ferrar, who had taken deacon&apos;s orders, was the real head of
                                the community. He prepared at Little Gidding what is perhaps the
                                earliest English monatesseron of the four gospels. By means of
                                relays of worshipers the Ferrars kept their devotions always in
                                progress. The entire Psalter was chanted anti-phonally during each
                                twenty-four hours. Those whose turn it was to keep vigil were wont
                                to leave a candle at the door of Nicholas and to wish him
                                good-morrow at one o&apos;clock in the morning, at which hour he
                                was accustomed to rise and begin the exercises of the day. The
                                strength of this belated medival saint gave way under a discipline
                                so austere, and he died in 1637. Little Gidding, with its

                                along which civilization might march into a savage wilderness. The

                                Virginia silk in the Commonwealth period is almost surpassed by
                                other projects of the time. In Virginia Richly Valued, 1650, perfume
                                was to be extracted from the muskrat, and the James River sturgeon
                                were to be domesticated. Fishes may be &quot;unwilded,&quot;
                                says the author. Besides feeding silkworms, the Indians were to be
                                used in pearl fisheries in Virginia waters. Wyckoff on Silk
                                Manufacture, Tenth Census, says that experimental silkworms had been
                                taken to Mexico by the Spaniards in 1531, without any permanent
                                results.</p>

                                </note> naval stores without the intervention of foreign merchants.
                                As early as 1583, Carlisle, who was son-in-law to Secretary
                                Walsingham, had subscribed a thousand pounds toward an American
                                colony, which it was urged would buy English woolens, take off idle
                                and burdensome people, and, among other things, produce naval
                                stores. In 1601 Ralegh had protested eloquently against the act to
                                compel Englishmen to sow hemp. &quot;Rather let every man use
                                his ground to that which it is most fit for,&quot; he said.

                                imminent probability of the overthrow of the company, which was
                                already impoverished, some of the adventurers or shareholders sent
                                nine men to Virginia to try a different method of making iron from

                                farmers of customs and monopolists of tobacco, he no doubt
                                contributed to that abandonment of Virginia to tobacco raising which
                                seemed to him so lamentable. The use of Spanish tobacco in England
                                was general before that from Virginia began to take its place.
                                Bar-nabee Rich says, in 1614: &quot;I have heard it tolde that
                                now very lately there hath bin a cathologue taken of all those new

                                He says such shops were &quot;almost in euery lane and in euery

                                biographer&apos;s myopia. He often seems to depend on tradition,
                                but in some passages his touch is more sure, and he writes like a

                                ceremonies in the reign of Elizabeth. The love of formality and
                                display that characterized the Renascence was then at its height. It
                                was a time of pomps and royal progresses. Great historic characters
                                went about dressed like performers in a show. Some of the
                                queen&apos;s gowns were adorned with jewels on every available
                                inch of space. These bespangled robes were draped over vast
                                farthingales, which spread out like tables on which her arms might
                                rest, and her appearance when thus attired has been compared to that
                                of an Oriental idol. Her courtiers and statesmen were equally fond
                                of dazzling the spectator. Ralegh wore a pendent jewel on his hat
                                feather, and the value of the gems on his shoes was estimated at six
                                thousand six hundred pieces of gold. The love of pomp was not

                                country.&quot; The gorgeous progresses of Elizabeth are too well
                                known to need description. A painting of the time shows her to us in
                                the act of making a friendly call on her cousin-german, Lord
                                Hunsdon. She is sitting under a canopy, and is borne on the
                                shoulders of men and attended by a brilliant train of lords and
                                ladies on foot. It was truer in the days of Shakespeare than it has

                                the attraction and were often put into imaginary dialogues. It was
                                Shakespeare&apos;s good fortune that he happened to live among a

                                chaplain offered a sorrowful prayer, and then George Percy, the
                                retiring governor, delivered up his authority to Sir Thomas Gates,
                                who thus found himself in due and proper form installed governor of
                                death, famine, and desperation. When Gates abandoned the wrecked
                                town with his starving company he fired a &quot;peale of small
                                shott,&quot; in order not to be wanting in respect for a royal
                                fort; and when De la Warr arrived, a few days later, he made his
                                landing with still greater pomp than that of Gates. There was a
                                flourish of trumpets on <pb id="VAA2449-115" n="102"/> shipboard
                                before he struck sail in front of Jamestown. A gentleman of his
                                party bore the colors of the governor before him. The
                                governor&apos;s first act when he set foot on American soil was
                                to fall on his knees and offer a long, silent prayer, which was
                                probably sincere though theatrical, after the manner of the age. He
                                rose at length and marched up into the ruined town. As he passed
                                into the stockade by the water gate, which was shabbily off its
                                hinges, the color bearer dropped down before him and allowed the
                                colors to fall at the feet of his lordship, who proceeded to the
                                tumble-down chapel, under the earthen roof of which the authority
                                over the colony was duly transferred to his hands with such
                                solemnities as were thought proper. Whenever Lord De la Warr went to
                                church at Jamestown he was attended by the councilors, captains, and
                                gentlemen, and guarded by fifty men with halberds, wearing De la

                                cities of the Continent. Strasburg, Frankfort, Basel, Zurich, and
                                Geneva were the places to which these English exiles mainly
                                resorted. Zurich and Strasburg became cities of refuge for many of

                                congregations. Five bishops and five deans of the English Church,
                                and more than fifty eminent doctors of divinity, with younger men
                                who were destined to play a leading part in the future, were
                                comprised in these little churches. Such communities soon became

                                compromises within itself. No form of religious life can become
                                national without exacting of its advocates of differing shades of
                                opinion many sacrifices for the sake of unity; but now that the
                                leaders of English Protestantism were in exile they found themselves
                                in a measure freed from motives of policy and with leisure to
                                develop and apply their theories. A passion for the ideal thus
                                suddenly <pb id="VAA2449-118" n="105"/> unchained easily becomes
                                rampant. There sprang swiftly a dispute between the church in
                                Strasburg and the church in Frankfort on matters of government. The
                                reformatory spirit is rarely conciliatory, and in its excess and
                                overflow it is wont to be pragmatic and impertinent. Some of the
                                reformers of Strasburg felt bound to go over to Frankfort and
                                re-reform the reformed English church there; and the little English
                                community in Frankfort was soon torn asunder between the followers
                                of Richard Cox and those of John Knoxthe same who was afterward so
                                famous in the Scottish reformation.</p>

                                characteristics that render church quarrels odious. One finds in it

                                unmanly treacheries that characterize such debates and disclose the
                                sorry threadbareness of human saintship even in exiles and martyrs
                                for conscience&apos; sake. But, petty as were these squabbles at
                                Frankfort, they produced results of the first magnitude. Small
                                things change the whole course of history when they lie near the
                                fountain head of a great current. From the conflicting factions in

                                parties that were to give character to English Protestantism, and to
                                modify profoundly the history of England and as profoundly the

                                appeared at length the features of the two great parties of English
                                Protestantism face to face for the first time. One of these parties
                                tried to hold all of antique ritual that the Protestant conscience
                                could be made to bear, insisted upon the superior authority of the
                                clergy, and sought to disturb as little as possible the ancient
                                order of the English church. On the other hand, in the rapid changes
                                produced by the Frankfort contentions, the tendency of the ultra
                                wing of the Protestants to the notion of a local and independent
                                church and to a democratic church government was already apparent.
                                Even the peculiarity of two ministers presiding over one church,
                                which was cherished later in New England, appeared<note

                                country. The two great parties that were to divide the English
                                church had already begun to crystallize. Those who had settled at
                                Strasburg and Zurich came back hoping to re-establish the Anglican
                                Church on the conservative basis of the Prayer Book of Edward VI.
                                Those who returned from Basel and Geneva had caught the spirit of
                                the Calvinistic churches, and wished to push the reformation to a
                                more logical extreme; while the Frankfort church, or what remained
                                of it, had been storm-driven well-nigh to a theory of congregational

                                However futile controversies may seem that seek to reduce to
                                formulas the relations between God and man, they have at least a
                                topical dignity. But the debates about ceremonies and vestments
                                which the exiles brought back to England from the Continent, and
                                which held first place there during the reign of Elizabeth and
                                James, were bitter without being serious. A life-and-death struggle
                                concerning the wearing of &quot;white surplices&quot; or the
                                making of the sign of the cross in baptism can not but seem
                                frivolous to the modern mind. Learned scholars like Broughton<note

                                was made. It was learnedly demonstrated that the ephod was of silk,
                                and there were sober essays on the linsey-woolsey side of that
                                controversy. To the fine-spun mind of that time the character of the
                                Jewish ephod was thought to settle the propriety of the Christian
                                surplice. To the modern reader the whole debate about vestments and
                                liturgies would be amusing if it were not so tedious. It is
                                necessary to steady one&apos;s judgment of that age by
                                remembering that deeper things sometimes lay concealed under these

                                temptible mint and cumin of ecclesiasticism. Puritanism at its rise
                                was an effort to escape from formalism, the outgrowth of an
                                aspiration for greater spirituality in worship; but it gradually
                                passed into an opposite formalism as rigid as that from which it had
                                escaped.</p>

                                </note> uniformity. The difference between the radical and the
                                conservative is constitutional, and is manifest in every period of
                                agitation. Neither the mediation of moderate men nor the compulsion
                                of authority can bring these two sempiternal divisions of the human
                                race into agreement. The conservative English churchman limited his
                                Protestantism to the rejection of the pope&apos;s authority, and
                                to certain moderate reforms in church government and ritual. He
                                shuddered with alarm at every proposal to reconstruct religious
                                institutions which were moss-grown with ancient sentiment. The
                                extreme Puritan, on the other hand, went about his work in the
                                spirit of a Jehu. He saved all his reverence for the precepts of the
                                Bible, now becoming common in the vulgar tongue. He applied biblical
                                phraseology to the affairs of life in a way that would have been
                                impossible had he possessed any sense of humor. He felt himself
                                impelled by the call of God to carry out in England the changes that
                                had taken place in the Calvinistic churches of the Continent, and to
                                go even further. He would have no surplices, no sign of the cross,
                                no liturgy, no church holy days. Away with these <pb

                                us get back to the simplicity of the primitive ages. The Anglican,
                                on the other hand, felt himself an Englishman above all, and without

                                well-defined and hostile camps. If there had been some relaxation of
                                the requirements of uniformity, if a conciliatory policy had been
                                pursued by the government, the ultimate division might have been
                                postponed until party spirit had cooled; but in that day blows took
                                the place of words, and words had the force of blows. The queen
                                herself could write to a bishop who scrupled to do what she desired,
                                &quot;By God, I will unfrock you!&quot; and moderation in
                                debate was not to be expected from lesser folk.</p>

                                grievances, and feebler movements seek shelter from the strong.
                                Puritanism <pb id="VAA2449-124" n="111"/> no doubt gathered momentum
                                from the widespread agrarian and industrial disturbance in this and
                                the preceding reigns. The profit from sheepraising had induced many
                                manor lords to inclose the wastes on which the peasants had pastured
                                their cattle for ages. The humble copy-hold tenant, having no longer
                                grass for his cows or mast for his pigs, was driven to distress by
                                agricultural progress. In some cases even the common fields,
                                cultivated in allotments from ancient times by the members of the
                                village communities, first as serfs and later as tenants, were
                                turned into sheepwalks, and hamlets of tenants&apos; cottages

                                symbolized by the vestments of bishop and clergy. Advanced
                                Protestants insisted that the shadows should be banished with the
                                substance, that the symbol should disappear with the dogma. We have
                                seen that in Frankfort the inchoate Puritan <pb id="VAA2449-125"
                                    n="112"/> party wished to abolish the litany and purge the
                                service book of all the remains of the old religion. This
                                controversy raged in England, and the Puritan side did not at first
                                lack support even among the bishops. But Elizabeth, the real founder
                                of Anglicanism, molded the church to her will, putting down
                                Catholics and Puritans with a hard hand. The more advanced of the
                                party came at length to believe that all &quot;stinted&quot;
                                prayers &quot;read out of a book&quot; were contrary to the
                                purity and simplicity of Christian worship. The hostility of the
                                bishops to that which the Puritans believed to be the cause of God
                                no doubt helped to convince the persecuted party that the episcopal
                                office itself was contrary to Scripture.</p>

                                Both the Presbyterians and those who held to local church government
                                wished to see their own system established by law. Neither faction

                                </note> in the Episcopal party. The earlier defenders of
                                Elizabeth&apos;s establishment argued, somewhat as Hooker did
                                later, that the &quot;practice of the apostles&quot; was not
                                an &quot;invariable rule or law to succeeding ages, because they
                                acted according to the circumstances of the church in its infant and
                                persecuted state.&quot; Episcopal government they held to be
                                allowable, and maintained the attitude of prudent men who justify
                                their compromise with history and the exigency of the time, and
                                advocate, above all, submission to civil authority. But the tendency
                                of party division is to push both sides to more positive ground.
                                There arose in the last years of Elizabeth a school of
                                High-churchmen led by Bancroft, afterward primate, who turned away
                                from Hooker&apos;s moderation and assumed a more aggressive
                                attitude. Like the Presbyterians and the Independents and the
                                Catholics, these in turn maintained that their favorite system of
                                church economy was warranted by divine authority, and that all
                                others were excluded.</p>

                                between the two ecclesiastical parties in England was complete. Each
                                had settled itself upon a supposed divine authority; each regarded
                                the other as teaching a theory contrary to the divine plan.
                                Elizabeth&apos;s policy of repression had produced a certain
                                organic uniformity, but the civil war of the seventeenth century was
                                its ultimate result.</p>

                                </note> parties naturally grew more bitter as time went on. The
                                silencing of ministers, the Fleet Prison, the inquisitorial
                                Ecclesiastical Commission, and other such unanswerable arguments did
                                not sweeten the temper of the Puritans. The bitterness of the
                                controversy reached its greatest intensity in 1588, when there
                                appeared a succession of anonymous tracts, most of them signed
                                Martin Marprelate. They seem to have been written mainly by the same
                                hand, but their authorship has been a matter of debate to this

                                interest. They were couched in the phrase of the street, in the very
                                slang and cant of the populace, and were violent and abusive,
                                sometimes descending <pb id="VAA2449-128" n="115"/> to sheer
                                blackguardism. Marprelate went gunning for large game; his deadliest
                                abuse he let fly as from a blunderbuss at the very heads of the
                                English church. The Dean of Salisbury he calls &quot;Doctor of
                                Diviltrie and Deane of Sarum.&quot; It was the first time in the
                                history of polemics that any one had addressed a high dignitary of
                                the church with such irreverent titles as &quot;You grosse

                                Martin bends his knees with mock reverence, as when he calls the

                                he cries to the Bishop of London. &quot;Go to, you

                                than bull-baiting.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Cooper, Bishop of Winchester, replied to the first pamphlet
                                somewhat ponderously, as became a bishop who feels that the
                                proprieties forbid his being too interesting. Marprelate wanted
                                nothing better than a bishop for an antagonist; and while the whole
                                constabulary force of the kingdom was hunting him for his life, the
                                nimble Martin was chuckling over the excitement made by a new tract
                                of his, headed with the well-known street cry of a tub-mender, which
                                played derisively on Bishop Cooper&apos;s name, &quot;Hay

                                stoops to make the bishop ridiculous by twitting him with the
                                infidelity of his wife, a scandal which the unfortunate prelate had

                                reading of the Bible as a part of the service came at last to be
                                reprehended by extremists, and the repetition of the Lord&apos;s
                                Prayer was thought dangerously liturgical. The advanced Puritans

                                nearly everything else, from the Old Testament. To the word
                                &quot;idolatry&quot; it gave an inclusiveness not found in
                                the Jewish Scriptures, and puzzling to a mind accustomed to modern
                                ways of thinking. There was hardly any set observance of the church
                                in which constructive idolatry did not lie concealed. All holy days
                                except Sunday were abhorred as things that bore the mark of the
                                Beast. Even in the reign of Edward VI, long before the name of
                                Puritanism was known, the May-poles round which English people made
                                merry once a year were denounced as idols in a sermon preached at

                                curate of St. Catherine Cree, was a forerunner of Puritanism, who
                                sometimes defiantly preached from an elm tree in the chuchyard and
                                read the service standing on a tomb on the north side of the church.
                                He wanted the saintly names of churches and the heathen names of
                                days of the week changed, so keen was his scent for idolatry. The
                                parish of St. Andrew Undershaft had received its distinctive name
                                from a very tall May-pole that overtopped the church steeple. This
                                pole was erected annually, and it rested from one May to another on
                                hooks under the eaves of a row of houses and stalls. In the newborn

                                bonfire. Puritanism kept up its Don Quixote battle against May-poles
                                until there was hardly one standing to seduce the people to
                                idolatry. When the Puritan<note id="note_312" place="right"

                                inevitable. History has many examples of this pervasiveness of
                                scrupulosity. The Puritan conscience had been let loose to tear in
                                pieces the remnants of old superstitions. It was certain to break
                                over into the field of conduct. Having set out to reform the church,
                                it took the world by the way.</p>
                            <p>As early as 1583 Philip Stubbes, a Puritan lawyer, issued his hot
                                little book, The Anatomie of Abuses. It deals with the immoralities
                                and extravagances of the time. Stubbes repeats the early Puritan
                                objection to the May-pole: it is a &quot;stinckyng <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-133" n="120"/> idol,&quot; he declares, which
                                the people bring from the woods, &quot;followyng it with greate
                                devotion.&quot; And when they have set it up they
                                &quot;leape and daunce aboute it, as the heathen people did at
                                the dedication of their idolles.&quot; But Stubbes takes a step
                                forward and objects to the all-night May frolics on account of their
                                immorality. He says, &quot;I have heard it credibly reported by

                                &quot;great gravitie, credite and reputation&quot; were not
                                likely to know the facts in this case, some of the immorality with
                                which Stubbes charges the young people may have been as fanciful as
                                the heathenism attributed to them. Imputed unrighteousness was a
                                part of the Puritan system. He denounces the wild excesses in dress
                                and the other follies of the time with a lack of a sense of
                                proportion which already foreshadows later Puritanism.</p>
                            <p>This secondary development of Puritanism by which its energies were
                                turned toward the regulation of conduct, as the disputes of the
                                Reformation period lost their violence, gave to the name Puritan a
                                new and higher sense. It is a phase of its history more important
                                than all its primary contentions over gowns and liturgies and
                                hierarchies, or its later debates about the five points of Calvinism
                                and a sabbatical Sunday. One may easily forget its austerity and
                                extravagance, for by the reform of <pb id="VAA2449-134" n="121"/>
                                manners this movement made the English race its debtor. In no
                                succeeding reaction have English morals reverted to the ante-Puritan
                                level. It is only by the religious ferments infused successively by
                                new sects and movements, of preaching friars, Lollards, Puritans,
                                Quakers, Methodists, Salvationists, that the great unleavened mass
                                of men is rendered gradually less sodden.</p>

                                </note> years of apparent Puritan decline. The old bugbear of popery
                                was receding into the past, and a new generation had come on the
                                stage that had no memory of the struggles of the reigns of Henry and
                                Edward and Mary. The danger from the Armada had brought English
                                patriotism to the point of fusion. Even the persecuted Catholics
                                rallied to the support of the queen against Philip. The government
                                of Elizabeth rose to the zenith of its popularity on the overthrow
                                of the Armada. It was just at this inopportune moment, when the
                                nation had come to feel that the England of Elizabeth was the
                                greatest England the ages had known, that there came forth from a
                                small coterie of the oppressed ultra-Puritans the Martin<note

                                reaction. The Puritans were dubbed Martinists, and henceforth had to
                                bear the odium of the boisterous vulgarity and <pb id="VAA2449-135"
                                    n="122"/> libelous exaggeration of the Marprelate lampoons. The
                                queen&apos;s government, stronger now than ever in the affection
                                of the people, put in force severe ecclesiastical measures against
                                nonconformists in the church, and sent Brownists, or Separatists, to
                                die by the score in loathsome prisons. Half a dozen of their leaders
                                were dispatched by the shorter road of the gallows. The long reign
                                of the queen had by this time discouraged those who hoped for a
                                change of policy at her death. Hooker&apos;s masterful and
                                delightful prose, informed by a spirit of winning moderation, was
                                arrayed on the side of the Anglicans by the publication of parts of
                                his Ecclesiastical Polity in 1594 and 1597. But Puritanism suffered
                                most from the persistence of Archbishop Whitgift and others in
                                efforts to suppress all nonconformity in the church. These champions
                                of Anglicanism, in the swaggering words of one of them,

                                bishops, were effective cries in the hot Reformation period. But the
                                new generation had ceased to abhor these left-overs of Romanism.
                                Bishops, gowns, prayer books, had become Protestant to most of the
                                people by association. To find additional reasons for differing from
                                Anglican opponents was a party necessity. The new debates which
                                sprang up in the last years of the sixteenth century were not
                                deliberately planned by the Puritans, as some of their opponents
                                asserted. They came by a process of evolution. But a period of
                                temporary decline in a movement of this sort hastens its natural
                                unfolding. The leaders are forced to seek the advantage of such new
                                issues as offer when the old ones fail. In the last years of
                                Elizabeth, Puritanism was molting, not dying.</p>

                                church holy days. Luther maintained that a commandment to keep the

                                for it is entirely outward, like other ordinances of the Old

                                oppugnancy he says: &quot;If anywhere the day is made holy for

                                similar statement of the Protestant position. Calvin considered the
                                fourth commandment binding on Christians only in a sense mystical
                                and highly Calvinistic. It signified that &quot;we should rest
                                from our own works&quot; under the Christian dispensation. He
                                even suggested that some other day of the week might be chosen as a
                                day of rest and worship at Geneva for an exhibition of Christian
                                liberty in this regard. His practice was conformed to his theory. It
                                is incidentally related that when John Knox once visited the Genevan
                                reformer on Sunday, he found him playing at bowls. Knox was not more
                                a sabbatarian than Calvin.</p>

                                formal treatise. Greenham was Bownd&apos;s stepfather, and his
                                work was the parent of Bownd&apos;s, which is distinctly more
                                extreme. But Dr. Bownd&apos;s, book is none the less memorable
                                as a point of departure, because in it the opinions on this subject
                                which have since prevailed so generally in all English-speaking
                                lands &quot;were for the first time broadly and prominently
                                asserted in Christendom&quot;; at least, they were here first
                                systematically propounded and defended. Bownd held that the fourth
                                commandment is partly moral, <pb id="VAA2449-142" n="129"/> in the
                                phrase of the casuists. He shifted the obligation to the first day
                                of the week by arguments now familiar, and he laid down rules for
                                the observance of the day. Honest recreations and lawful delights he
                                flatly forbids on Sundays, but he rather obsequiously makes some
                                allowance for the &quot;feasts of noblemen and great personages
                                on this day.&quot; People of rank do not wholly escape him,
                                however, for he points a moral with the story of a nobleman whose
                                child was born with a face like that of a dog, because the father
                                had hunted on the Lord&apos;s Day. He allows the ringing of only

                                performers were gayly decked and hung with jingling bells in

                                were played on stages under booths and sometimes in the churches. As
                                an austere reaction <pb id="VAA2449-143" n="130"/> against
                                frivolity, Puritanism pushed Sabbath-keeping to its extreme,
                                reprobating even the most innocent and domestic recreations, and
                                changing a day of rest and refreshment into one of alternate periods
                                of application to religious devotion and of scrupulous vacuity.
                                Bownd&apos;s rather ultra propositions were carried yet further
                                when reproduced by high-strung preachers. It is said that some of
                                these declared that the ringing of more than one bell to call people
                                to church on the Sabbath was as great a sin as murder, adultery, or
                                parricide. The lack of a sense of proportion is the specific
                                distinction of the zealot and the polemic. This lack was not
                                peculiar to the Puritans, however. Joseph Hall, afterward a
                                well-known bishop, could address men so worthy as John Robinson and
                                his colleague in such words as these: &quot;Your souls shall
                                find too late . . . that even whoredoms and murders shall abide an
                                easier answer than separation.&quot; Perhaps one may rather say
                                that a lack of the sense of proportion in morals was a trait of that
                                age, an age of zealots and polemics.</p>

                                becoming a law to themselves, forbearing such sports as yet <pb

                                shifting of the ground of debate, aroused Archbishop Whitgift. In
                                1599 he made <pb id="VAA2449-145" n="132"/> the tactical mistake of
                                ordering the book called in, and in 1600 Chief-Justice Popham
                                forbade the reprinting of it. The price of the work was doubled at
                                once, and it was everywhere sought for, books being &quot;more
                                called on when called in,&quot; as Fuller says. When it could
                                not be had in print, it was transcribed by enthusiastic admirers and
                                circulated &quot;from friend to friend&quot; in manuscript.

                                the Puritans made rigid Sabbath-keeping the very mark and password

                                by making Puritanism the party of a stern and conservative
                                orthodoxy, as opposed to the newer Arminianism which spread so
                                quickly among the High-Church clergy. From all these fresh
                                developments Puritanism gained in power and compactness, if it lost
                                something of simplicity and spirituality. Standing for
                                ultra-Protestantism, for good morals, for an ascetic Sabbath, for a
                                high dogmatic orthodoxy, Puritanism could not but win the allegiance
                                of the mass of the English people, and especially of the middle
                                class. It was this new, compact, austere, dogmatic, self-confident
                                Puritanism, when it had become a political as well as a religious
                                movement, that obliterated Laud and Charles and set up the
                                Commonwealth. And in studying the evolution of this later Puritanism

                                retainers of an earlier time he was ready to fight in any of his

                                dignity to the mansion and to amuse the master or his guests with
                                conversation during lonely hours in the country house. Among the
                                first Jamestown emigrants were some of these retainers, as we have

                                </note> is the primary authority. It is almost beyond doubt that
                                Whitingham, Dean of Durham, a participant in the troubles, wrote the
                                book. The Frankfort struggles have been discussed recently in Mr.
                                Hinds&apos;s The Making of the England of Elizabeth, but, like
                                all writers on the subject, Hinds is obliged to depend almost solely
                                on Whittingham&apos;s account. The several volumes of letters
                                from the archives of Zurich, published by the Parker Society, give a
                                good insight into the forces at work in the English Reformation.
                                See, for example, in the volume entitled Original Letters,
                                1537-1558, that of Thomas Sampson to Calvin, dated Strasburgh,
                                February 23; 1555, which shows the Puritan movement half fledged at
                                this early date when Calvin&apos;s authoritative advice is
                                invoked. &quot;The flame is lighted up with increased vehemence
                                amongst us English. For a strong controversy has arisen, while some
                                desire the book of reformation of the Church of England to be set
                                aside altogether, others only deem some things in it objectionable,
                                such as kneeling at the Lord&apos;s Supper, the linen surplice,
                                and other matters of this kind; but the rest of it, namely, the
                                prayers, scripture lessons and the form of the administration of
                                baptism and the Lord&apos;s Supper they wish to be

                                1583, in the Anatomie of Abuses, pp. 126, 127, writes:
                                &quot;They take in and inclose commons, moores, heathes, and
                                other common pastures, where out the poore commonaltie were wont to

                                effect of inclosures, but the conservative laments of the antiquary
                                Aubrey, in his Introduction to the Survey of Wiltshire, written
                                about 1663, give us a nearer and more picturesque, if less
                                philosophical, view. He says: &quot;Destroying of Manours began
                                Temp. Hen. VIII., but now common; whereby the mean People live
                                lawless, no body to govern them, they care for no body, having no
                                Dependance on any Body. By this Method, and by the Selling of the
                                Church-Lands, is the Ballance of the Government quite
                                alter&apos;d and put into the Hands of the common
                                People.&quot; Writing from what he had heard from his
                                grandfather, he says: &quot;Anciently the Leghs i. e. Pastures
                                were noble large Grounds. . . . So likewise in his Remembrance was
                                all between Kington St. Michael and Dracot-Ferne common Fields. Then

                                the subject of inclosures here. A portion of the agricultural
                                population seemed superfluous in consequence of inclosures, and
                                colonization was promoted as a means of ridding the country of the
                                excess of its population.</p>

                                </note> three different periods. In the reign of Elizabeth the
                                Church-Puritan was mainly Presbyterian under Cartwright&apos;s
                                lead. But there was even then a current that set toward
                                Independency. Separatism was the outward manifestation of this
                                tendency, and according to Ralegh&apos;s estimate, cited in the
                                text, there were about twenty thousand declared Separatists in
                                England in 1593. After the suppression of the presbyteries within
                                the Church in the last years of Elizabeth, and the crushing out of
                                the Separatists by rigorous <pb id="VAA2449-150" n="137"/>
                                persecutions, questions of the particular form of Church government
                                fell into abeyance among the Puritans for about forty years.
                                &quot;Indiscriminate anti-prelacy was the prevailing mood of the
                                English people,&quot; says Masson, &quot;and the distinction
                                between Presbyterianism and Independency was yet caviare to the
                                general.&quot; Life of Milton, ii, 590. Richard Baxter, the
                                Puritan divine (as quoted by Masson), confesses in 1641 that until
                                that year he had never thought what Presbytery or Independency was,
                                or ever spoke with a man who seemed to know it. See also
                                Hanbury&apos;s Memorials, ii, 69. Writers on this period do not
                                seem to recognize the fact that the two views were in some rivalry
                                among the early Puritans, and that the theory of the independence of
                                the local church seems to have been at least foreshadowed in the
                                opinions at Frankfort. But there was a long generation in which
                                these differences among the Puritans were forgotten in their
                                life-and-death conflict with the Episcopal party. Then, as
                                Puritanism came into power, the example of other Protestant European
                                countries drew England toward Presbyterianism, while the voice of
                                New England came from over the sea pleading for
                                Congregationalism.</p>

                                </note> quoted by Marsden, Early Puritans, 57, shows that though
                                Puritanism by 1573 had become something other than it was at
                                Frankfort, it was still mainly negative. Sandys writes:
                                &quot;New orators are rising up from among us; foolish young men
                                who despise authority and admit of no superior. They are seeking the
                                complete overthrow and uprooting of the whole of our ecclesiastical
                                polity; and striving to shape out for us I know not what new
                                platform of church.&quot; He gives a summary under nine heads.
                                The assertion that each parish should have its own
                                &quot;presbytery&quot; and choose its own minister, and that
                                the judicial laws of Moses were binding, are the only positive ones.
                                No authority of the magistrate in ecclesiastical matters, no
                                government of the Church except by ministers, elders, and deacons,
                                the taking away of all titles, dignities, lands, and revenues of
                                bishops, etc., from the Church, the allowing of no ministers but
                                actual pastors, the refusal of baptism to the children of papists,
                                fill the rest of this summary. One misses from this skeleton the
                                insistence on Sabbath-keeping, church-going,
                                &quot;ordinances,&quot; and ascetic austerity in morals that
                                afterward became distinctive traits of the party.</p>

                                middle ages, St. Thomas Aquinas and other schoolmen taking the
                                prevalent modern view that the fourth commandment was partly moral
                                and partly ceremonial. There is a curious story, for which I do not

                                from city to city against buying and selling on Sundays and
                                saints&apos; days. He had with him a copy of a document dropped
                                from heaven and found on the altar of St. Simon, on Mount Golgotha.
                                This paper threatened that if the command were disobeyed it should
                                rain stones and wood and hot water in the night, and, as if such
                                showers were not enough, wild beasts were to devour the
                                Sabbath-breakers. That there was a difference of opinion in that age
                                is shown by the fact that Roger Bacon, later in the thirteenth
                                century, thought it worth while to assert that Christians should
                                work and hold fairs on Sunday, while Saturday was the proper day for
                                rest. He showed no document from heaven, but, like a true
                                philosopher of that time, the learned friar appealed to arguments
                                drawn from astrology. Hearne&apos;s Remains, ii, 177, cites
                                Mirandula. Legislation by Parliament regarding Sunday observance was
                                rare before the Reformation. A statute of 28 Edward III incidentally
                                excepts Sunday from the days on which wool may be shorn, and one of
                                27 Henry VI forbids the keeping of fairs and markets on Sundays,
                                Good Fridays, and principal festivals except four Sundays in
                                harvest. In 4 Edward IV a statute was passed forbidding the sale of
                                shoes on Sundays and certain festivals.</p>

                                legislation in the proper sense; but there are efforts to compel the
                                people to suspend buying and selling fish and flesh in the market,
                                the playing of outdoor games and ninepins, and the selling of

                                developed from some Sermons on the Subject a work with the title,
                                Theses Sabbaticae, or the Doctrine of the Sabbath. After a
                                considerable circulation in manuscript among New England students of
                                divinity, it was printed at London in 1650 by request of all the
                                elders of New England. From the time of Augustine the prevailing
                                theory of advocates of a Sunday-Sabbath has been that the fourth
                                commandment is partly moral, partly ceremonial; but Shepard, who
                                does not stick at small logical or historical difficulties, will
                                have it wholly moral, by which means he avoids any option regarding
                                the day. The rest of the Sabbath, according to this authoritative
                                New England treatise, is to be as strict as it ever was under Jewish
                                law, and is to be rigidly enforced on the unwilling by parents and
                                magistrates. In the spirit of a thorough-paced literalist Shepard
                                argues through fifty pages that the Sabbath begins in the evening.
                                He admits that only &quot;servile labour&quot; is forbidden,
                                but he reasons that as &quot;sports and pastimes&quot; are
                                ordained &quot;to whet on worldly labour,&quot; they
                                therefore partake of its servile character and are not tolerable on
                                the Sabbath. It appears from his preface that there were Puritans in
                                his time who denied the sabbatical character of Sunday and
                                spiritualized the commandment.</p>

                                &quot;Brownists,&quot; as they were commonly called, who did
                                not stop with rejecting certain traits of the Anglican service, but
                                spurned the church itself. Upon these ultraists fell the merciless
                                hand of persecution. They were imprisoned, hanged, exiled. They were
                                mostly humble people, and were never numerous; but by their superior
                                boldness in speech and writing, by their attempts to realize actual
                                church organizations on apostolic models, they rendered themselves
                                considerable if not formidable. From this advance guard and forlorn
                                hope of Puritanism, inured to hardship and the battle front, came at
                                length the little band of New England pioneers who made a way into
                                the wilderness over the dead bodies of half their company. The
                                example of these contemned Brownists led to the Puritan settlement
                                of New England. Their type of ecclesiastical organization ultimately
                                dominated the Congregationalism of New England and the
                                non-conformity of the mother country. For these <pb id="VAA2449-155"

                                of the rule of Whitgift and the High Commission Courts, Puritan
                                divines slighted or omitted the liturgy in many parishes. This
                                became more common after the rise of Cartwright and the Presbyterian

                                ordination, succeeded in holding his deanery of Durham until his
                                death, in 1579. In 1563 Dr. Turner was sneering at bishops as

                                    <p>Causes of Separatism.</p>
                                </note> two causes. An almost incredible reverence for the letter of
                                the Scriptures had taken the place of older superstitions. There was
                                a strong tendency to revert to the stern spirit of the Old Testament
                                and to adopt the external forms of the New. Religious idealists saw
                                a striking contrast between the discipline of the primitive and
                                almost isolated bands of enthusiastic believers in the apostolic
                                time and the all-inclusive parishes of the hierarchical state
                                church. And in that age of externalism the difference in organic
                                form between the Anglican church and the little synagogues of
                                Christian seceders founded by Paul in the Levant weighed heavily
                                upon the minds of earnest people. It did not occur to them that this
                                primitive organization was probably brought over from the
                                neighboring Jewish congregations from which the converts had
                                withdrawn, and that there might not be any obligation to imitate it
                                under different skies and in a remote age. The Separatist was an
                                idealist. &quot;He<note id="note_370" place="left"

                                Separatism was undoubtedly promoted by persecution. Bradford <pb

                                that religious enthusiasts began to long for societies organized

                                and made peace with the English church. He accepted a benefice, but

                            <p>It seems that their rise in London came from the devout meetings of
                                those who had begun to repudiate the Church of England as
                                antichristian. Without any officers or organization apparently,
                                these people, when we first get sight of them, were wont to assemble
                                in the summer time in the fields about London, sitting down upon a
                                bank while the Bible was expounded now by one and now by another of
                                the company. In the winter it was their custom to spend the whole
                                Sunday together from five o&apos;clock in the morning, eating
                                dinner in company and paying for it by a collection. They responded
                                in prayer only by spontaneous groans or sobs, much after the fashion
                                of the early Quakers, Methodists, and other enthusiasts of a

                                to the apostolic epistles. These had already been treated like the

                                at pleasure. From them whatsoever form of discipline was desired by
                                Anglican, Presbyterian, or Brownist had been derived, and now a
                                still different discipline was deduced, a mean betwixt Presbyterian
                                and Brownist theories. This is known now as Barrowism. It was the
                                form of church government brought by the Pilgrims to Plymouth, and
                                substantially that which prevailed in New England throughout the
                                seventeenth century.</p>
                            <p>The London Separatists suffered miserably from persecution. Many of
                                them languished and died in prison. Barrow and Greenwood, their
                                leaders, were hanged at Tyburn. A part of them migrated to
                                Amsterdam, while the rest maintained a furtive church in London.

                                members, and they were soon torn asunder with dissensions as the
                                result of this vicariousness of conscience. The innocent vanity <pb

                                uninteresting village, with a rustic inn. More than a mile to the
                                southward, in Nottinghamshire, lies the pleasant but commonplace
                                village of Scrooby. About a mile to the north of Bawtry is
                                Austerfield, a hamlet of brick cottages crowded together along the
                                road. It has a picturesque little church built in the middle ages,
                                the walls of which are three feet thick. This church will seat
                                something more than a hundred people nowadays by the aid of a rather
                                modern extension. In the seventeenth century it was smaller, and
                                there was no ceiling. Then one could see the rafters of the roof
                                while shuddering with cold in the grottolike interior. The country
                                around is level and unpicturesque.</p>
                            <p>But one is here in the cradle of great religious movements. In
                                Scrooby and in Austerfield were born the Pilgrims who made the first
                                successful settlement in New England. A little to the east <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-164" n="150"/> lies Gainsborough, from which
                                migrated to Holland in 1606 the saintly Separatist John Smyth, who
                                gave form to a great Baptist movement of modern times. A few miles
                                to the northeast of Bawtry, in Lincolnshire, lies Epworth, the nest
                                from which the Wesleys issued more than a hundred years later to
                                spread Methodism over the world. Religious zeal seems to have
                                characterized the people of this<note id="note_386" place="left"

                                about Scrooby was occupied at that time by an unusual number of
                                religious houses.</p>
                            <p>The little Austerfield church and the old church at Scrooby are the
                                only picturesque or romantic elements of the environment, and on
                                these churches the Pilgrims turned their backs as though they had
                                been temples of Baal. In the single street of Austerfield the
                                traveler meets the cottagers of to-day, and essays to talk with
                                them. They are heavy and somewhat stolid, like most other rustic
                                people in the north country, and an accent to which their ears are
                                not accustomed amuses and puzzles them. No tradition of the Pilgrims
                                lingers among them. They have never heard that anybody ever went out
                                of Austerfield to do anything historical. They listen with a bovine
                                surprise if you speak to them of this exodus, and they refer you to
                                the old clerk of the parish, who will know about it. The venerable
                                clerk is a striking figure, not unlike that parish clerk painted by
                                Gainsborough. This oracle of the hamlet knows that Americans come
                                here as on a pilgrimage, and he tells you that one of them, a <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-165" n="151"/> descendant of Governor Bradford,
                                offered a considerable sum for the disused stone font at which
                                Bradford the Pilgrim was baptized. But the traveler turns away at
                                length from the rustic folk of Austerfield and the beer-drinkers
                                over their mugs in the inn at Bawtry, and the villagers at Scrooby,
                                benumbed by that sense of utter common-placeness which is left on
                                the mind of a stranger by such an agricultural community. The
                                Pilgrims, then, concerning whom poems have been written, and in
                                whose honor orations without number have been made, were just common
                                country folk like these, trudging through wheat fields and along the
                                muddy clay highways of the days of Elizabeth and James. They were
                                just such men as these and they were not. They were such as these
                                would be if they were vivified by enthusiasm. We may laugh at
                                superfluous scruples in rustic minds, but none will smile at brave
                                and stubborn loyalty to an idea when it produces such steadfast
                                courage as that of the Pilgrims.</p>
                            <p>And yet, when the traveler has resumed his journey, and recalls
                                Scrooby and Bawtry and Austerfield, the stolid men and gossiping
                                women, the narrow pursuits of the plowman and the reaper, and
                                remembers the flat, naked, and depressing landscape, he is beset by
                                the old skepticism about the coming of anything good out of
                                Nazareth. Nor is he helped by remembering that at the time of
                                Bradford&apos;s christening at the old stone font the

                                outer and inner court. In this manor-place, about half a century
                                after Leland saw it, there lived William Brewster. He was a man of
                                education, who had been for a short time in residence at Cambridge;
                                he had served as one of the under secretaries of state for years;
                                had been trusted beyond all others by Secretary Davison, his patron;
                                and, when Elizabeth disgraced Davison, in order to avoid
                                responsibility for the death of Mary of Scotland, Brewster had been
                                the one friend who clung to the fallen secretary as long as there
                                was opportunity to do him service. Making no further effort to

                                </note> of the Virginia Company has already been recounted. At
                                Scrooby Brewster succeeded his father in the office of
                                &quot;Post,&quot; an office that obliged him to receive and
                                deliver letters for a wide district of country, to keep relays of
                                horses for travelers by post on the great route to the north, and to
                                furnish inn accommodations. In the master of the post at Scrooby we
                                have the first of those influences that lifted a group of people
                                from this rustic region into historic importance. He had been
                                acquainted with the great world, and had borne a responsible if not
                                a conspicuous part in delicate diplomatic affairs in the
                                Netherlands. At court, as at Scrooby, he was a Puritan, and now in
                                his retirement his energies were devoted to the promotion of
                                religion. He secured earnest ministers for many of the neighboring
                                parishes. But that which he builded the authorities tore down.
                                Whitgift was archbishop, and the High Commission Courts were
                                proceeding against Puritans with the energy of the Spanish
                                Inquisition. &quot;The godly preachers&quot; about him were
                                silenced. The <pb id="VAA2449-168" n="154"/> people who followed
                                them were proscribed, and all the pains and expense of Brewster and
                                his Puritan friends in establishing religion as they understood it
                                were likely to be rendered futile by the governors of the church.

                                of stone steps. Here, Brewster&apos;s hospitality was dispensed
                                to them freely. They may or may not have been members of the
                                Separatist church at Gainsborough, as some have supposed. It was not
                                until 1606 that these people formed the fully organized Separatist
                                church of Scrooby. It was organized after the Barrowist pattern that
                                had originated in Londonit was after a divine pattern, according to

                                Brewster could probably have returned to the court under other

                                his cabin an octogenarian, he led a life strangely different from
                                that of a courtier. But no career possible to him at court could
                                have been so useful or so long remembered.</p>

                            <p>But Brewster was not the master spirit. About the time the
                                Separatists of Scrooby completed their church organization, in 1606,
                                there came to it John Robinson. He had been a fellow of Emmanuel
                                College, Cambridge, and a beneficed clergyman of Puritan views. He,
                                too, had been slowly propelled to Separatist opinion by persecution.
                                For fourteen years before the final migration he led the Pilgrims at
                                Scrooby and Leyden. Wise man of affairs, he directed his people even
                                in their <pb id="VAA2449-170" n="156"/> hard struggle for bread in a
                                foreign country. He was one of the few men, in that age of debate
                                about husks and shells, who penetrated to those teachings concerning
                                character and conduct which are the vital and imperishable elements
                                of religion. Even when assailed most roughly in debate he was
                                magnanimous and forbearing. He avoided the bigotry and bitterness of
                                the early Brownists, and outgrew as years went on the narrowness of
                                rigid Separatism. He lived on the best terms with the Dutch and
                                French churches. He opposed rather the substantial abuses than the
                                ceremonies of the Church of England, and as life advanced he came to
                                extend a hearty fellowship and communion to good men in that church.
                                Had it been his lot to remain in the national church and rise, as
                                did his opponent, Joseph Hall, to the pedestal of a bishopric or to
                                other dignity, he would have been one of the most illustrious
                                divines of the agewanting something of the statesmanly breadth of
                                Hooker, but quite outspreading and overtopping the Whitgifts,
                                Bancrofts, and perhaps even the Halls. Robert Baillie, who could say
                                many hard things against Separatists, is forced to confess that
                                &quot;Robinson was a man of excellent parts, and the most
                                learned, polished, and modest spirit that ever separated from the
                                Church of England&quot;; and long after his death the Dutch
                                theologian Hornbeeck recalls again and again his integrity,

                                Robinson was able to mold a few of the best of them to great uses,
                                and that these became the significant digits which gave value to the

                                argument in a theological controversy. Browne&apos;s enemies
                                alleged that even while on the gridiron of persecution his conduct
                                had not been free from moral obliquity. I have not been able to see
                                Bernard&apos;s charges on this score, but John Robinson, in his
                                Justification, etc. (1610), parries the thrust in these words:
                                &quot;Now as touching Browne, it is true as Mr. B[ernard]
                                affirmeth, that as he forsook the Lord so the Lord forsook him in
                                his way; . . . as for the wicked things (which Mr. B. affirmeth) <hi

                                learned accounts of Browne is to be found in H. M. Dexter&apos;s
                                Congregationalism, the lecture on Robert Browne. It is always easy
                                to admire Dr. Dexter&apos;s erudition, but not so easy to assent
                                to his conclusions. See also Pagitt&apos;s Heresiography, p. 56

                                Memorials, which imply the existence of Independent congregations in

                                reign. But Hanbury&apos;s handling of the valuable material he
                                collected with commendable assiduity is sometimes so clumsy that the
                                reader is obliged to grope for facts bearing upon most important
                                questions. One gets from Hanbury&apos;s notes and some older
                                publications a vague notion that the Flemish Protestants, recently
                                settled in England in great numbers, exerted an influence in favor
                                of Independency. Robert Browne began his secession in Norwich, a
                                place where the people from the Low Countries were nearly half the
                                population, and Browne was even said to have labored among the Dutch

                                well as the most upright, learned, and most modest.

                                had spoken with a different voice, but the Puritans remembered his
                                lifelong familiarity with Presbyterian forms, and his strongly
                                expressed satisfaction with the Scottish Kirk. They met him on his
                                way to London with a petition for modifications of the service. This
                                was known as the Millinary Petition, because it was supposed to
                                represent the views of about one thousand English divines.</p>

                                James, who, by his action at this meeting, unwittingly made himself
                                a conspicuous figure in the history of America. The great church-men
                                were surprised at the display made by the king of dialectic skill.
                                They held Scotch learning in some contempt, and were amazed that one
                                bred among the &quot;Puritans&quot; should know how to
                                handle questions of theology so aptly. James, though he had declared

                                world&quot; because it did not keep Easter and Yule as the

                                believed after he was ten years old what he was taught in Scotland.
                                His speeches in the conference are marked by ability, mingled with
                                the folly which vitiated all his qualities. Quick at reply and keen
                                in analysis, he even shows something like breadth of intelligence,
                                or at least intellectual toleration, but without ever for a moment
                                evincing any liberality of feeling. His manifest cleverness is
                                rendered futile by his narrow and ridiculous egotism, his arrogance

                                the wolf. Laying down for <pb id="VAA2449-175" n="161"/> his
                                fundamental maxim &quot;No bishop, no king,&quot; he drew a
                                picture of the troubles that would beset him when &quot;Jack and
                                Tom and Will and Dick&quot; should meet and censure the king and
                                his council. He would have no such assemblage of the clergy until he
                                should grow fat and pursy and need trouble to keep him in breath, he
                                said. It could not occur to his self-centered mind that so grave a
                                question was not to be settled merely by considering the ease and
                                convenience of the sovereign. &quot;He rather usede upbraidinges

                                flavored his orthodoxy, the aged Whitgift declared that undoubtedly

                                for him a recreation not much more serious than stag-hunting. That

                                harriers let loose by James and Bancroft were in full cry. The
                                members of the Scrooby church found themselves &quot;hunted and
                                persecuted on every side,&quot; having their houses watched

                                one division of these, questions of whalebone in bodices, of
                                high-heeled shoes and women&apos;s hats, distracted scrupulous
                                minds. In the other, which came from the same part of England as
                                Robinson&apos;s church, the agitations were of a theological
                                nature. Questions about the baptism of infants and the inherent
                                righteousness of man and the portion of his nature that Christ
                                derived from his mother, with discussions of the right of a man to
                                be a magistrate and a church member at the same time, were seething
                                in the heated brain of the scrupulous but saintly pastor. Robinson
                                saw that these controversies would involve the Scrooby church if it
                                remained in Amsterdam. In Robinson the centrifugal force of
                                Separatism had already spent itself, and his practical wisdom had
                                set bounds to the course of his <pb id="VAA2449-180" n="166"/>
                                logic. To leave the Dutch metropolis for a smaller place was to
                                reduce the Scrooby exiles to still deeper poverty, but nevertheless
                                the Pilgrims fled from discord as they had fled from persecution,
                                and removed to the university city of Leyden, called by its admirers
                                &quot;the Athens of the Occident.&quot; After their
                                departure English Separatism in Amsterdam went on tearing itself to
                                pieces in a sincere endeavor to find ultimate theological truth, but
                                Robinson&apos;s people in spite of their poverty were united,
                                and were honored by those among<note id="note_423" place="left"

                                </note> was not a pleasant one. The life in Leyden was so hard that
                                many chose to return to their own land, preferring English prisons
                                to liberty at so dear a rate. The &quot;tender hearts of many a
                                loving father and mother&quot; were wounded to see children
                                growing prematurely decrepit under the weight of hard and incessant
                                toil; &quot;the vigor of Nature being consumed in the very bud
                                as it were.&quot; Some of the young people were contaminated by
                                the dissoluteness of the city, others joined the Dutch army or made
                                long voyages at sea, acquiring habits very foreign to the strictness
                                of their parents. The result of a contest between the rigid
                                Puritanism of the little church and the laxity <pb id="VAA2449-181"

                                nature can not remain always at concert pitch. Intermarriages with
                                the Dutch had already begun, and all that was peculiar in the
                                English community was about to be swallowed up and lost forever in

                                result. The persecutions which followed the accession of Bancroft to
                                the archbishopric had started as early as 1608 a widespread
                                agitation among the Puritans in favor of emigration to Virginia,

                                return with highly colored reports of the condition of the Virginia
                                colony. It is noticeable that among the books owned by Elder
                                Brewster at his death was a copy of Whitaker&apos;s Good Newes
                                from Virginia, published in 1613. Whitaker was minister at Henrico
                                in Virginia, and was the son of a Puritan divine of eminence who was
                                master of St. John&apos;s College, Cambridge. It is possible
                                that he was known to Brewster, who had been at Cambridge, or to
                                Robinson, who had resigned a fellowship there to become a
                                Separatist. Whitaker himself was Puritan enough to discard the
                                surplice. His Good Newes is an earnest plea for the support of the
                                colony for religious reasons. &quot;This plantation which the

                                people in Europe. The glowing account of Guiana given by Ralegh
                                helped to feed the new desire for an American home; and it was only
                                after serious debate that North America was chosen, as more remote
                                from the dreaded Spaniard and safer from tropical diseases. One can
                                hardly imagine what American Puritanism would have become under the
                                skies of Guiana. Not only did the Pilgrims hesitate regarding their
                                destination, but there was a choice of nationalities to be made.
                                England had not been a motherly mother to these outcast children,
                                and there was question of settling as English subjects in America,
                                or becoming Dutch colonists there.</p>

                                his eldest son, Sir Samuel Sandys, who was Brewster&apos;s
                                landlord and brother of Sir Edwin Sandys. Of Sir Edwin the great
                                liberal parliamentary statesman, Fuller says, &quot;He was
                                right-handed to any great employment.&quot; In 1617 he was
                                already the most influential of the progressive leaders of the
                                Virginia Company, its acting though not yet its nominal head, and in
                                1619 he was elected governor of the Company. Brewster&apos;s
                                fellow-secretary under Davison was a chosen friend of Sandys, and,
                                in view of both these connections, we may consider it almost certain
                                that the two were not strangers. To Sir Edwin Sandys was due much of
                                the new interest in Virginia. He and his group seem to have been
                                already striving to shape the colony into a liberal state.</p>

                                </note> Sandys endeavored by the intervention of a more acceptable
                                courtier to gain assurance from the king, under the broad seal, that
                                their religion should be tolerated if they migrated to Virginia. But
                                James&apos;s peculiar conscience recoiled from this. He
                                intimated that he would wink at their practices but he would not
                                tolerate them by public act. And, indeed, the Pilgrims reflected
                                afterward that &quot;a seale as broad as the house flore would
                                not serve the turne&quot; of holding James to his promise. At

                                approve such an arrangement. Nor can one wonder at their
                                unwillingness, since the most profound, liberal, and far-seeing
                                thinker of that age, Lord Bacon himself, was so far subject to the
                                prejudices of his time that he could protest against allowing
                                heretics to settle a colony, and could support his position by a
                                mystical argument fit to be advanced by the most fantastic
                                theologian. &quot;It will make schism and rent in

                                undertakings are to be carried forward. The transplanting of English

                                toward democratic government. The patent given to the Pilgrims was
                                also a liberal one, and it was even proposed to put into their hands
                                a large sum of money contributed anonymously for the education of
                                Indian children, but to this it was objected that the newcomers
                                would lack the confidence of the savages. One of the Virginia
                                Company, possibly Sandys himself, lent to the Leyden people three

                                than all, Sir Edwin Sandys, were the fathers of representative
                                government in New England by the charter of February 2, 1620, as
                                they had been of representative government in Virginia by the
                                charter of November 13, 1618. When the Pilgrims found themselves,
                                upon landing, too far north to use their &quot;large
                                patent&quot; from the Virginia Company, they organized a

                                to Elizabeth Island in Buzzard&apos;s Bay in 1602, but the men
                                went back in the ship in order to share the profit of a cargo of
                                sassafras. Captain George Popham was the head of a party that
                                undertook to colonize the coast of Maine in 1607, but having
                                suffered &quot;extreme extremities&quot; during the winter,
                                the colonists returned the following year. In 1615 Captain John
                                Smith himself set out with sixteen men, only to be taken by a French
                                privateer. These and other attempts ending in failure, and many
                                disastrous trading voyages, led to a belief that the Indian
                                conjurers, who were known to be the devil&apos;s own, had laid a
                                spell on the northern coast to keep the white people away. This

                                people died before the coming of spring. The same system of

                                been chosen governor on the death of Carver, a few months after the
                                arrival at Plymouth, had been a youth but eighteen years old when he
                                fled with the rest of the Scrooby church to Holland. He was bred to
                                husbandry <pb id="VAA2449-194" n="180"/> and had inherited some
                                property. In Holland he became a silk worker and on attaining his
                                majority set up for himself in that trade. He was still a young man
                                when first chosen governor of the little colony, and he ruled New
                                Plymouth almost continuously till his deaththat is, for about
                                thirty-seven years. He was of a magnanimous temper, resolute but
                                patient, devotedly religious, but neither intolerant nor austere. He
                                had a genius for quaintly vivid expression in writing that marked
                                him as a man endowed with the literary gift, which comes as Heaven

                                Bradford had the courage and wisdom to cut the knot he could not
                                untie. During the scarce springtime of 1623, he assigned all the
                                detached persons in the colony to live with families, and then
                                temporarily divided the ancient Indian field on which the settlement
                                had been made among the several families in proportion to their
                                number, leaving every household to shift for itself or suffer want.

                                assignment was a revolutionary stroke, in violation of the contract
                                with the shareholders, and contrary to their wishes. But Bradford
                                saw that it was a life-and-death necessity <pb id="VAA2449-195"

                                settlement that was never very flourishing, that consisted at its
                                best of only a few thousand peaceful and agricultural people, and
                                that after seventy years was merged politically in its more vigorous

                                not depend on population. Plymouth was the second step in the
                                founding of a great nation. When Bradford and the other leaders had
                                at last successfully extricated the little settlement from its
                                economical difficulties, it became the sure forerunner of a greater
                                Puritan migration. This tiny free state on the margin of a
                                wilderness continent, like a distant glimmering pharos, showed the

                                rendered pretty certain from passages in his letters. For instance,
                                he writes to Crashaw from Jamestown, August 9, 1611, desiring that
                                young and &quot;godly&quot; ministers should come, and adds,
                                &quot;We have noe need either of ceremonies or bad
                                livers.&quot; British Museum, Additional MSS., 21,993. (The
                                letter is printed in Browne&apos;s Genesis, 499, 500.) In a
                                letter given in Purchas and in Neill, 95, dated June 18, 1614, he
                                says that neither subscription nor the surplice are spoken of in
                                Virginia. It has escaped the notice of church historians that
                                Whitaker&apos;s semi-Puritanism seems to have left traces for
                                many years on the character and usage of the Virginia church. The
                                Rev. Hugh Jones writes as late as 1724 in his Present State of
                                Virginia, p. 68, that surplices were only then &quot;beginning

                                have put it in the text. It is worth while transferring
                                Neill&apos;s remarks from the New England Genealogical Register,
                                vol. xxx, 412, 413: &quot;The action of the passengers of the

                                London Company, under whose patent the ship sailed. On June 9, 1619,
                                O. S., John Whincop&apos;s patent was duly sealed by the
                                Company, but this which had cost the Puritans so much labor and
                                money was not <pb id="VAA2449-198" n="184"/> used. Several months
                                after, the Leyden people became interested in a new project. On
                                February 2, 1619-&apos;20, at a meeting at the house of Sir
                                Edwin Sandys in Aldersgate, he stated to the Company that a grant
                                had been made to John Peirce and his associates. At the same
                                quarterly meeting it was expressly ordered that the leaders of

                                Plimouth Plantation, 90, says they &quot;chose or rather
                                confirmed Mr. John Carver, . . . their Governour for that
                                year&quot;that is, for 1620. Mr. Deane, the editor of Bradford,
                                has lost the force of this by misunderstanding a statement in
                                Mourt&apos;s Relation, so called. See Deane&apos;s note,
                                page 99, of Bradford. The statement in Mourt is under date of March
                                23d. I quote from the reprint in Young, 196, 197: &quot;and did
                                likewise choose our governor for this present year, which was Master
                                John Carver,&quot; etc. Young applies Bradford&apos;s words,
                                &quot;or rather confirmed,&quot; to this event, and Deane
                                also supposes that Bradford confuses two elections. Carver was no
                                doubt chosen in England or Holland under authority of the charter to
                                serve for the calendar year, and confirmed or rechosen after the
                                Compact was signed. What took place on the 23d of March was that a
                                governor was elected for the year 1621, which, according to the
                                calendar of that time, began on the 25th of March. For the next year
                                they chose Carver, who was already &quot;governor for this
                                present year,&quot; and whose first term was about to expire.
                                Both Deane and Young failed to perceive the pregnant fact that
                                Carver was governor during the voyage, and so lost the force of the
                                words &quot;or rather confirmed.&quot; Bradford, in that
                                portion of his History of Plimouth Plantation which relates to this
                                period, gives several letters illustrating the negotiations of the
                                Pilgrims with the Virginia Company. The MS. Records of the Company

                                relating to the Whincop Charter, which was not used, on account of
                                Whincop&apos;s death, and the Pierce Charter, which the Pilgrims

                                remarkable that the dominant liberal faction in the Virginia Company
                                    <pb id="VAA2449-199" n="185"/> is here accused of seeking to do
                                what the Massachusetts Company afterward didto wit, to found a
                                popular American government by virtue of powers conferred in a
                                charter. That liberal government in New England had its rise in the
                                arrangements made with the London or Virginia Company before
                                sailing, and not, as poets, painters, and orators have it, in the
                                cabin of the Mayflower, is sufficiently attested in a bit of
                                evidence, conspicuous enough, but usually overlooked.
                                Robinson&apos;s farewell letter to the whole company, which
                                reached them in England, is in Bradford, 64-67, and in
                                Mourt&apos;s Relation. It has several significant allusions to
                                the form of government already planned. &quot;And lastly, your
                                intended course of civill communitie will minister continuall
                                occasion of offence.&quot; The allusion here seems to be to the
                                joint-stock and communistic system of labor and living proposed. In
                                another paragraph the allusion is to the system of government:
                                &quot;Whereas, you are become a body politik, using amongst your
                                selves civil governmente, and are not furnished with any persons of
                                spetiall emencie above the rest, to be chosen by you into office of
                                governmente,&quot; etc., &quot;you are at present to have
                                only them for your ordinarie governors, which your selves shall make
                                choyse of for that worke.&quot; That the government under the
                                Virginia Company was to be democratic is manifest. The compact was a
                                means of giving it the sanction of consent where the patent and the
                                general order did not avail for that purpose.</p>

                                of Robinson&apos;s form of Independency. Five of the ministers
                                who went to Holland in 1637 and founded churches, published in 1643

                                Robinson&apos;s words are almost repeated in the phrase
                                &quot;they coming new out of popery . . . might not be perfect
                                the first day.&quot; Robinson&apos;s early colleague, Smyth,
                                the unpractical, much-defamed, but saintly
                                &quot;Anabaptist,&quot; says in a tract published after his

                                Robinson wrote a reply to a portion of this tract. See
                                Barclay&apos;s Inner Life, appendix to Chapter V, where the
                                tract is given. This holding of their opinions in a state of flux,
                                this liberal expectancy of a further evolution of opinion, was a
                                trait to be admired in the early Separatists in an age when modesty
                                in dogmatic statement was exceedingly rare.</p>

                                embarrassments of Cape Cod shoals were very real; a trading ship
                                sent out by the Pilgrims after their settlement, failed to find a

                                Virginia Colony had virtually failed, and that the Pilgrim
                                settlement was the means of reviving it. This has been often
                                repeated on no other authority than that of Hutchinson, who wrote
                                nearly a century and a half after the event. The list of patents for
                                plantations in Virginia as given by Purchas, in which appears that
                                of Master &quot;Wincop,&quot; under which the Pilgrims
                                proposed to plant, is a sufficient proof that Virginia was not
                                languishing. &quot;These patentees,&quot; says Purchas,
                                &quot;have undertaken to transport to Virginia a great multitude
                                of people and store of cattle.&quot; Virginia had reached the
                                greatest prosperity it attained before the dissolution of the
                                company, in precisely the years in which the slender Pilgrim Colony
                                was preparing. It is quite possible to honor the Pilgrims without
                                reversing the order of cause and effect.</p>

                                the taking away of propertie, and bringing in communitie into a
                                comone wealth, would make them happy and florishing; as if they were
                                wiser than God. For this communitie (so fare as it was) was found to
                                breed much confusion and discontent, and retard much imployment that
                                would have been to their benefite and comforte. For the yong-men
                                that were most able and fitte for labour and service did repine that
                                they should spend their time and streingth of worke for other mens
                                wives and children with out any recompence. The strong, or man of
                                parts, had no more in devission of victails and cloaths, then he
                                that was weake and not able to doe a quarter the other could; this
                                was thought injuestice. The aged and graver men to be ranked and
                                equalised in labours, and victails, cloaths, &amp;c., with the
                                meaner and yonger sorte, thought it some indignite and disrespect
                                unto them. And for mens wives to be commanded to doe servise for
                                other men, as dresing their meate, washing their cloaths,
                                &amp;c., they deemd it a kind of slaverie, neither could many
                                husbands well brooke it. Upon the point all being to have alike, and
                                all to doe alike, they thought them selves in the like condition,
                                and one as good as another; and so if it did not cut of those
                                relations that God hath set amongest men yet it did much diminish
                                and take of the mutuall respects that should be preserved amongst
                                them. And would have bene worse if they had been men of another

                                Pilgrims had migrated, hoping to be &quot;stepping-stones to
                                others,&quot; as they phrased it. They thought that many
                                like-minded in matters of religion would come to them out of
                                England, but the Separatist movement had been worn out by
                                persecution. There were few open dissenters left, and the Pilgrims,
                                by their long exile, had lost all close relations with their own
                                country. Among those that came to Plymouth from England were some
                                whose coming tended to dilute the religious life and lower the moral
                                standards of the colony. The fervor of the Pilgrims themselves
                                abated something of its intensity in the preoccupations incident to
                                pioneer life. The hope of expanding their religious organization by
                                the rapid growth of the colony was not fulfilled; discontented
                                Puritans were not eager to settle under the government of
                                Separatists, and ten years after their migration the Plymouth colony
                                contained little more than three hundred people.</p>

                                the Pilgrims went back. This is the capital fact in their history. A
                                new force had been introduced into colonization. Henceforth
                                persecuted or discontented religionists, prompted by a motive vastly

                                migration. From 1607 until the arrival of the Pilgrims in 1620 no
                                English colony had landed on the northern coast; but after the
                                Pilgrims came, fish-drying and fur-buying stations began to appear
                                on the banks of the Piscataqua and the coast eastward in 1622 and
                                1623. These tiny settlements were germs of New Hampshire and Maine,
                                the only New England plantations begun without any admixture of
                                religious motives. A commercial colony was tried in Massachusetts
                                Bay as early as 1622, but it failed. There were other like attempts.
                                In 1624 some men of Dorchester, headed by John White, the
                                &quot;Patriarch&quot; Puritan clergyman, sent out a colony
                                to Cape Ann. The members of this company were to grow maize to <pb

                                season the same men were to lend a hand on board the ships, which
                                would thus be saved the necessity for carrying double crews. But
                                this plausible scheme proved a case of seeking strawberries in the
                                sea and red herrings in the wood. Farmers were but lubbers at

                                Plymouth and elsewhere. He wrote ribald verses which he posted on

                                women participated. <pb id="VAA2449-206" n="191"/> He broke all the

                                wrought whatever other deviltry came within his reach, until his

                                </note> James I had been the party of strict morals, of austere and
                                Pharisaic scrupulosity, of rigid Sabbath observance, and of
                                Calvinistic dogmatism. During that reign it had passed through its

                                anti-Catholic politics at home and abroad. Because Parliament was on
                                its side, the mere course of events had made the Puritan party favor

                                and this brought it to represent liberalism in politics. By his
                                unconcealed partisanship, James had contrived to make the Puritans a
                                permanent opposition suspected of disliking monarchy itself. Charles

                                Elizabeth&apos;s reign it had been the party of innovation. It
                                was no longer the party of change in religion when Charles came to
                                the throne. The adoption of the Arminian system of doctrine by many
                                of the High-churchmen, and the reactionary innovations now proposed
                                by ecclesiastics like Laud, had left Puritanism to stand for
                                Protestant conservatism. It was immeasurably the gainer with the
                                mass of slow-moving people by this change of relative position. The
                                parliamentary struggle with James and Charles added to the religious
                                Puritans a numerous body of political Puritans who, without much
                                care about religion, were fain to ally their political discontent
                                with the discontent of those who resisted ecclesiastical
                                retrogression. This compact party, powerful after all its defeats,
                                was bound by its position to cherish every aspiration for the
                                improvement of morals, every indignant movement for the suppression
                                of abuses, and it became the ally of every popular resentment
                                against royal absolutism or episcopal encroachment, and the
                                advocate, almost to fanaticism, of an anti-Spanish foreign policy,

                                Dr. Laud, Bishop of St. Davids at the death of James, and soon

                                opponent, Archbishop Abbott, to take the primacy, much of the power

                                of ideas have rendered a sympathetic judgment of him difficult.
                                Ecclesiastic above all, he was not, like Whitgift and Bancroft, a
                                Protestant High-churchman. He sought to make the English church
                                Catholic and medival, yet he would on no account attach it to Rome.
                                Like Whitgift, he made the church dependent on royal authority, and
                                in this he was far removed <pb id="VAA2449-209" n="194"/> from the
                                earlier churchmen. There was nothing spiritual in his nature; his
                                personal devotion had neither agony nor exaltation. He had none of
                                the medival enthusiasm that prompted the vigils of his contemporary,
                                Nicholas Ferrar, for example, and elevated the master of Little
                                Gidding to a saintship, amiable and touching. Notwithstanding the
                                energy of Laud&apos;s devotion, his nature was as shallow and
                                objective as it was sincere. It has been remarked that when Laud
                                spoke of the beauty of holiness he meant no more than decorum in
                                public worship, the beauty of a well-ordered church and of proper
                                intonation and genuflexion. He seemed to touch a modern note when he
                                proposed to suppress the futile debate between Calvinists and
                                Arminians because it tended to disturb Christian charity; but
                                Laud&apos;s Christian charity, like his holiness, was purely
                                external; it was merely quiet submission to one ritual and one form
                                of discipline. His relentless, vindictive, and even cruel temper
                                toward opponents showed him incapable of conceiving of charity in
                                any spiritual sense. He disliked controversy because it put
                                obstacles in the way of uniformity, and he had no taste for
                                speculative debate because it tended to undermine authority. His
                                intellect was utterly practical and phenomenally acute. It was
                                incredibly energetic, and its energy was intensified by its
                                narrowness. His attachment to the church had no relation to the
                                beneficent utilities of the church. The church was a fetich for
                                which he was ready to die without <pb id="VAA2449-210" n="195"/> a
                                murmur. In his zeal he was reckless of personal danger and sometimes
                                unmindful of the moral complexion of his actions. His egotism was so
                                inter-blended with his zeal that he could not separate one from the
                                other, nor can the student of his character. A disservice to him was
                                an affront to Almighty God. The very honesty of such a man is
                                pernicious; a little duplicity might have softened the outward
                                manifestations of his hard nature. Unhappily, there was not even
                                indolence or self-indulgence to moderate his all but superhuman
                                activity, which pushed his domination to its possibilities, and,
                                with a vigilance aspiring to omniscience, penetrated to the minutest
                                details in the administration of church and state. He even filed
                                papers giving the elements of the debates on good works as an
                                evidence of sanctification carried on between Hooker and Cotton in
                                the cabin meeting-houses of New England. For the rest he presents
                                the paradoxes one expects in so marked a character. While he had no
                                taste for the credulous dogmatism of his time, he showed a certain
                                relish for superstitions in recording dreams and omens, yet he had
                                none of the timidity of superstition. He was, moreover, fearless in
                                peril, and he faced unpopularity without flinching. Stubborn and
                                inflexible with the clergy and the populace, obdurate and pitiless
                                with those who had offended him or his king or his church, he was
                                flexible and insinuating in his relations with those in power. His
                                unworthy yielding to his early patron, the Earl of <pb

                                concerned his ecclesiastical conscience, gave him a bitter and
                                lifelong repentance. His complacence to Buckingham, and his servile
                                devotion to Charles, seem a little despicable. He was even willing

                                Persecution had failed to drive Puritan ministers or their followers
                                into what they deemed the capital sin of schism. They hated the
                                domination of the bishops, communion with the ungodly, and the
                                absence of a rigid discipline. But they had been sustained through
                                long years of waiting by the hope of delivering the church from
                                those who oppressed and defiled her. They proposed, whenever they
                                could gain power, to winnow the chaff from the wheat, and they
                                probably destined the chaff to swift destruction. But the hope of
                                seeing a church without spot or wrinkle, prayer book or bishop, died
                                under the reactionary policy of Buckingham and Laud, and many came
                                to look with favor on a project whose full import was only whispered

                                carried to London, where it soon became, in the phrase of that time,
                                &quot;vulgar,&quot; or, as we should say, popular. Its
                                countenance to the world, and especially toward the government, was
                                that of a commercial venture like the planting of Virginia, but in
                                its heart it was a religious enterprise. In March, 1628, the Council
                                for New England gave to the Massachusetts projectors a patent for
                                lands extending from the Merrimack to the Charles and three miles
                                beyond each river. The western boundary of this tract was the
                                Pacific Ocean, for holders of grants could afford to be generous in
                                giving away the interior of an unexplored continent about which
                                nothing was known but that it abounded in savages.</p>

                                the colony. He lacked the moderation and saneness needed in a
                                leader, and his long career in connection with Massachusetts was
                                marked from the beginning by mistakes born of a rash temper and
                                impulsive enthusiasm. Two of the gentlemen emigrants who had been
                                named by the company in London as members of the local Council were
                                not willing to go to the unexpected lengths Endecott favored in the
                                organization of the Salem church, though they were probably Puritans
                                of a moderate type. They held a separate service with a small
                                company, using the prayer book. Endecott appears to have made no
                                effort at conciliation; he promptly shipped John and Samuel Browne,
                                pack and prayer book, back to England. This was precisely the course
                                that even Lord Bacon advised in the treatment of schismatics who
                                should contrive to gain access to a colony, and there is no occasion
                                for surprise that a quixotic enthusiast like Endecott did not hold
                                broader views than those of a philosopher of the same period. But
                                Endecott&apos;s rash action endangered the whole enterprise,
                                which required at this stage the extreme of prudence. The alarmed

                                result than to ruin Endecott&apos;s reputation for prudence.
                                Endecott, however, went on fighting the Lord&apos;s battles
                                against the Apollyons of his <pb id="VAA2449-216" n="201"/> fancy,
                                regardless of results. Soon after his arrival he marched to the den
                                of Morton, the profligate master of &quot;Merrymount.&quot;
                                In the absence of Morton he hewed down the profane Maypole in
                                God&apos;s name, and solemnly dubbed the place Mount Dagon, in
                                memory of the Philistine idol that fell down before the ark of the
                                Lord. At a later period he cut one arm of the cross out of the
                                English colors of the Salem trainband, in order to convert the Union
                                Jack to Protestantism. One of the many manifestations of his
                                pragmatical conscience was his Tartuffian protection of modesty by

                                against the crime of wearing wigs. A strange mixture of rashness,
                                pious zeal, genial manners, hot temper, and harsh bigotry, his
                                extravagances supply the condiment of humor to a very serious
                                historyit is perhaps the principal debt posterity owes him. But
                                there was a side to his career too serious to be humorous. Bold
                                against Maypoles and prayer books and women who presented themselves
                                in church immodestly barefaced, and in the forefront against wigs,
                                he was no soldier either in prudent conduct or vigor of attack. When
                                intrusted with the command of an expedition to demand satisfaction
                                of the Pequots, he proved incapable of anything but a campaign of
                                exasperation. When late in life he was governor of Massachusetts,
                                and had become, after the death of Winthrop and Dudley, the dominant
                                    <pb id="VAA2449-217" n="202"/> political leader, the putting to
                                death of Quakers left an ineffaceable blot on the history of the
                                colony he had helped to found. When the colony was brought to book
                                in England for this severity, Endecott showed himself capable of
                                writing one of the most cringing official letters on record, as full
                                of cant as it was of creeping servility. In him we may clearly
                                apprehend certain unamiable traits of Puritanism and of the early
                                seventeenth century which appear in his character in exaggerated
                                relief. This hearty and energetic bigot must have been
                                representative of a large, though not of the better, element in
                                Massachusetts Puritanism, for he was chosen to the governorship
                                oftener than any other man during the continuance of the old charter

                                a larger agitation in favor of migration to New England. The course
                                of events in England was so adverse to Puritanism that those who
                                were devoted to that purified church, which was as yet invisible,
                                except to the eye of faith, began to look toward America. Every door
                                for public action in state or church was closed to the Puritans in
                                England, closed and barred by Courts of High Commission, by the Star
                                Chamber, and by the Tower. Into one of the gloomiest rooms of the
                                latter had lately gone, at the arbitrary command of the king, that
                                high-spirited martyr to constitutional liberty, Sir John Eliot.
                                Finding no way by which to come out again except a postern of
                                dishonor, Eliot deliberately chose to languish and die in prison.
                                The almost hopeless outlook at home, the example set by
                                Endecott&apos;s emigration to New England in 1628, and by that
                                of Higginson&apos;s company in 1629, perhaps also the
                                ever-active propagandism of &quot;Father White&quot; of
                                Dorchester, set agoing among the Puritans a widespread interest in
                                the subject. Some of the leading minds thought it a noble work to
                                organize a reformed church in a new country, since, in their view,
                                the Church of England, under Laud, had taken up its <pb

                                books of a kind to shrink from print. It contained arguments in
                                favor of removing to New England, with answers to the various
                                objections made against emigration. Several copies of these Reasons,

                                appears to have been in its earliest form the production of

                                the dissuasion of friends kept him from entering the ministry. Of
                                judicial temper, he came to be often consulted upon points of
                                conscience, which gave much trouble in that age of casuistry and
                                abounding scruples. His kindly visits to those who were in any
                                trouble of spirit were highly prized. He himself makes much of the
                                corruptions of his own nature and of his juvenile aberrancy, but
                                generosity and purity of spirit like his are born and not acquired.
                                His devoutness, accompanied by a habit of self-criticism in the
                                presence of Infinite Justice, doubtless gave additional vigor to his
                                virtues. For the rest, he was a man of independent estate, of
                                prudent and conciliatory carriage, of a clear but not broad mind.
                                What, as much as anything else, fitted him for his function was that
                                all his virtues were cast in Puritan molds and all his prejudices

                                London. This company secured a patent to lands in Massachusetts Bay
                                from the Council for New England. The patentees intended both a
                                commercial enterprise and a Puritan settlement. They sent Endecott,
                                one of their number, as agent or superintendent, with a company<note

                                of other patentees. In March, 1628, they secured a liberal charter
                                from the king, which gave them the right to establish in
                                Massachusetts a government subordinate to the company. The plan was
                                to settle a government in the form rendered familiar by that of the
                                Virginia Company. The Massachusetts Company in London sent a
                                commission to Endecott as governor on the place subject to the
                                orders of the company in England. A council of assistants was

                                a government directed from England, and thus subject to English
                                stockholders and liable to interference from the court. Cradock had
                                been a leader and the most liberal investor in the enterprise. He,
                                no doubt, readily foresaw the great advance that the colony would
                                make if Winthrop and his friends should embark their lives and
                                fortunes in it, and he may have intended to emigrate himself. The
                                annulling of the charter of the Virginia Company on frivolous
                                pretexts had shown how easily the Massachusetts charter might meet
                                the same fate in a reign far more devoted to arbitrary government
                                than that of James and entirely hostile to Puritanism. There could
                                hardly be a doubt that the charter would be revoked as soon as its
                                projectors should develop their true purpose before the
                                all-observing eyes of Laud, who was now rising rapidly to dominant
                                influence in the government. It was at this juncture probably that
                                Cradock conceived his ingenious plan. He would resign his place and
                                have the officers of the company chosen from gentlemen about to
                                embark for the plantation. The charter prescribed no place of
                                assembling to the company, which had been left free apparently to
                                make its headquarters at its birthplace in Dorchester or at its new
                                home in London. It was also free to meet in any other <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-224" n="209"/> place. The meetings of the company
                                might therefore be held in Massachusetts, where the Puritanism of
                                its proceedings would attract less attention. The governor and other
                                officers would then be chosen in the colony; the company and the
                                colony would thus be merged into one, and the charter transported to
                                Massachusetts would perhaps be beyond the reach of writs and
                                judgments.</p>

                                Cradock&apos;s proposition before it was mooted in the company
                                on the 28th of July. The plan was probably thought of in consequence
                                of their objection to emigration under the Virginia system.
                                Cradock&apos;s proposition was at least the turning point of
                                their decision. Nearly a month later, on the 26th of August, the

                                solemnly pledged themselves, &quot;in the presence of God who is
                                the searcher of all hearts,&quot; &quot;to pass the Seas
                                (under God&apos;s protection) to inhabit and continue in New
                                England.&quot; The preamble states the object of this migration.
                                It was not civil liberty, the end that political Puritans had most
                                in view, and certainly there is no hint of a desire for religious
                                liberty. Even the conversion of the Indian is not uppermost in this
                                solemn resolve. &quot;God&apos;s glory and the
                                church&apos;s good&quot; are the words used. This has the
                                true ring <pb id="VAA2449-225" n="210"/> of the Puritan churchman.
                                The whole pledge is couched in language befitting men who feel
                                themselves engaged in a religious enterprise of the highest
                                importance.</p>
                            <p>This pledge contained a notable proviso. The signers agreed to
                                emigrate only on condition that &quot;the whole government
                                together with the patent for said plantation&quot; should be
                                transferred and legally established in the colony by order of the
                                General Court of the Company, and that this should be done before
                                the last of the ensuing month. There was opposition to the removal
                                of the government, and this peremptory condition was necessary.
                                Three days later, after a debate, the company voted that its
                                government should be transferred to Massachusetts Bay.</p>

                                the church. The founding of a new church establishment, after what
                                they deemed the primitive model, was the heart of the enterprise.
                                This is shown in many words uttered by the chief actors, and it
                                appears in strong relief in an incident that occurred soon after the
                                arrival of Winthrop&apos;s company. Isaac Johnston, the
                                wealthiest man of the party, succumbed to disease and hardship, but
                                &quot;he felt much rejoiced at his death that the Lord had been
                                pleased to keep his eyes open so long as to see one church of Christ
                                gathered before his death.&quot; Here we have the Puritan
                                passion for a church whose discipline and services should realize
                                their idealsa passion that in the stronger men suffered no abatement
                                in the midst of the inevitable pestilence and famine that were wont

                                Plymouth. The Puritans of the Massachusetts colony were not
                                Separatists. No one had been more severe in controversy with the
                                Separatists than some of the Puritans who remained in the Church of
                                England. They were eagerly desirous not to be confounded with these
                                schismatics. When the great migration of 1630 took place, the <pb

                                There were some, like the Brownes whom Endecott sent out of the
                                colony, that were even unwilling to surrender the prayer book. The
                                greater part of the earlier Puritans had desired to imitate the
                                Presbyterianism of Scotland and Geneva, and in Elizabeth&apos;s
                                time they had organized presbyteries. Nothing seemed more probable
                                beforehand than the revival in New England of the presbyteries of
                                the days of Cartwright. But what happened was unexpected even by the
                                Puritans. The churches of Massachusetts were formed on the model of

                                who all their lives long had made outward and inward compromises

                                antagonistic authority found themselves at length utterly free. It
                                was not that action was freed from the restraint of fear, so much as
                                that thought itself was freed from the necessity for politic
                                compromises. Every ship thus became a seminary for discussion. Every
                                man now indulged in the unwonted privilege of thinking his bottom
                                thought. The tendency to swing to an extreme is all but irresistible
                                in the minds of men thus suddenly liberated. To such enthusiasts the

                                be repressed, obliterated, in their new organization.<note

                                further temptation to think ill of those at Plymouth, who, like
                                themselves, had suffered much to avoid what both Separatists and
                                Puritans deemed unchristian practices. A common creed and common

                                at Plymouth. The Plymouth people were not backward to send friendly
                                help to the newcomers. The influence of the physician sent from
                                Plymouth to Endecott&apos;s party in the prevailing sickness
                                soon persuaded the naturally radical Endecott to the Plymouth view
                                of church government. Winthrop&apos;s associates, or the greater
                                part of them, drifted in the same direction, to their own surprise,
                                no doubt. There was a lack of uniformity in the early Massachusetts
                                churches and some clashing of opinion. Some ministers left the

                                independency became the established religion in New England, whence

                                account of himself leaves the impression that the author was just
                                the sort of clever and reckless rake who is most dangerous to

                                sort. The Royal Proclamation in Rymer&apos;s Foedera, xvii, 416
                                (and Hazard&apos;s State Papers, i, 151), 1622, sets forth the
                                evil of the sale of arms to the savages, but it was leveled at
                                earlier offenders than Morton. Compare Sainsbury&apos;s

                                provision was inserted in the Connecticut Charter in 1662, in
                                imitation of that of Massachusetts.) The common seal of the
                                Massachusetts colony, sent over in 1629, bore an Indian, with the
                                inscription, &quot;Come over and help us.&quot;
                                Young&apos;s Chronicles of Massachusetts, 155, Instructions to
                                Endecott. The paper of &quot;Reasons,&quot; attributed to
                                Winthrop, keeps the conversion of the Indians in view, but it is
                                blended with that which was in his mind the main end, the founding
                                of a Puritan church. The first paragraph reads, &quot;It will be
                                a service to the Church of great consequence to carry the Gospell
                                into those parts of the world, to helpe on the comminge of the
                                fullnesse of the Gentiles, &amp; to raise a Bulworke against the
                                kingdome of Ante-Christ which the Jesuites labour to reare up in
                                those parts.&quot; Life and Letters of Winthrop, i, 309. The
                                copy of this paper in Sir John Eliot&apos;s handwriting has a
                                preamble written in a nervous style that may well be
                                Eliot&apos;s own. This preamble goes back to the conversion of
                                the Indians as a main purpose. The Antapologia of T. Edwards, 1644,
                                declares that White of Dorchester and others had the conversion of
                                the Indians in view in promoting emigration to New England. Edwards
                                says, page 41, that the establishing of Congregational churches
                                &quot;was not in the thoughts of them that were the first movers
                                in that or of the ministers that were sent over in the
                                beginning.&quot; The statement is quite too strong, but the
                                ecclesiastical purpose seems to have grown rapidly when the number
                                of emigrants revealed the greatness of the opportunity.</p>

                                at the time the charter for the <pb id="VAA2449-233" n="218"/>
                                Pilgrim colony was granted, and like that which was formed at
                                Plymouth under the Compact. The Massachusetts form may have been
                                borrowed from Plymouth. This may be considered the primary form of
                                colony government in the scheme of the Virginia Company. The plan
                                antedates the formation of the Virginia Company by at least twenty
                                years, for it was a form proposed by Ralegh when, in 1587, he
                                organized his colony under the title: &quot;The Governor and
                                Assistants of the city of Ralegh in Virginia.&quot; The
                                secondary form of government was that prescribed for Virginia in the
                                charter of 1618, which added a lower house elective by the people.
                                This fully developed government could come only when the population
                                had become large enough to render a representative system
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>It has been maintained by several writers that the charter had<note

                                </note> been worded with a view to removal. See, for example,
                                Palfrey&apos;s New England, i, 307. But a paper read before the
                                Massachusetts Historical Society, and printed in the Proceedings for
                                December, 1869, by the late Charles Deane, shows that such a
                                presumption is groundless. In calling the subordinate government of
                                Endecott &quot;London&apos;s Plantation in Massachusetts Bay
                                in New England,&quot; the company showed that it proposed to
                                keep its headquarters in London. It is open to question, however,
                                whether Deane does not go too far in denying that the charter gave
                                authority for the transfer. In that technical age the letter of the
                                instrument would probably be counted more conclusive than at
                                present, and the evidence of the dockets would have less weight. The
                                removal of the government was not one of the charges made in the <hi
                                    rend="i">quo warranto</hi> proceedings against the company. On
                                the main question compare also the very significant treatment of the
                                subject by Winthrop in his paper on Arbitrary Government, Life and
                                Letters, ii, 443, where he expressly says that it was intended to
                                have the chief government in England, &quot;and with much
                                difficulty we gott it abscinded.&quot; It is to be remembered
                                that the exercise of governmental functions by a commercial
                                corporation was not a novel spectacle in that age. In 1620 the
                                English and Dutch East India Companies, after having been at war
                                while the two nations were allies, concluded a treaty of peace. No
                                doubt the exercise of such powers by trading companies had been made
                                familiar by the mingling of the functions of government with those
                                of commerce by the merchants of the Hanse cities. The East India and
                                the Hudson Bay Companies continued to exercise territorial
                                jurisdiction until a very recent period.</p>

                                by the uneasy. The discontent that comes from poverty and financial
                                reverse, that which is born of political unrest, and that which has
                                no other cause than feverish thirst for novelty and hazardous
                                adventure, had each a share in impelling Englishmen to emigrate. But
                                in the seventeenth century religion was the dominant concernone
                                might almost say the dominant passionof the English race, and it
                                supplied much the most efficient motive to colonization. Not only
                                did it propel men to America, but it acted as a distributing force
                                on this side of the sea, producing secondary colonies by expelling
                                from a new plantation the discontented and the persecuted to make
                                fresh breaks in the wilderness for new settlements. Connecticut and

                                being creativemen of sagacity as differentiated from men of ideas.
                                The man in whose mind there is a ferment of original ideas has
                                theories to promulgate or expound. Sagacity has small necessity for
                                speechits very reticence gives an advantage in the conduct of
                                affairs. The parliamentary antagonist and political rival who
                                confronted Calvert was no other than our old acquaintance Sir Edwin
                                Sandys, of the Virginia Company. Calvert and Sandys were alike men
                                of rare accomplishments, and both were interested in schemes for
                                colonization; otherwise they were antipodal. Sandys was a statesman
                                of advanced ideas, creative, liberal, and original, fitted to be the
                                founder of representative government in the English colonies. In
                                that age of worn and brittle institutions it was not deemed wholly
                                safe to suffer so robust a thinker as Sandys to be always at large,
                                and it was one of Calvert&apos;s most difficult duties, as the
                                king&apos;s secretary and chosen intermediary, to explain to
                                Parliament why its leader was under restraint. Sandys, as we have
                                already said, was described as &quot;right-handed to <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-237" n="222"/> every great employment&quot;;
                                when Calvert came upon the scene, he was aptly characterized as
                                &quot;a forward and knowing person in matters relating to the
                                state.&quot; The phrase denotes, perhaps, clever adroitness
                                within the limits of that mediocrity which in those perilous times
                                was a safeguard to the man who ventured into politics. After having
                                started well at court, Sandys had fallen into irretrievable disfavor
                                by his resolute advocacy of the liberties of his countrymen. The
                                message to the Virginia Company, already recited, &quot;Choose
                                the devil, but not Sir Edwin Sandys,&quot; expressed the depth
                                of the king&apos;s antipathy. But if Sandys seemed to the king a
                                devil, Calvert became for him a convenient angel. Notions about
                                human rights and the liberty of Parliament did not obstruct
                                Calvert&apos;s career. Not that he was a man to prove unfaithful
                                to his convictions, as did his bosom friend Wentworth, or to
                                suppress liberal opinions in order to smooth an ascending pathway,
                                as did his great contemporary Bacon. Calvert played a far simpler
                                part and one less dishonorable. It was his fortune to be a man of
                                facile mind, naturally reverential toward authority. The principles
                                enunciated by his sovereign and the measures by which those in power
                                sought to attain the end in view were pretty sure to seem laudable
                                or at least excusable to him. Such a mind can not be called
                                scrupulous, neither is it consciously dishonest. The quality most
                                highly esteemed at the court of James was fidelity, unswerving
                                devotion to the interests of <pb id="VAA2449-238" n="223"/> the king
                                and of one&apos;s friends. And this, the dominant virtue of his

                                high degree; it is a standard by which he has a right to be judged.
                                To a French ambassador he seemed an honorable, sensible, courteous,
                                well-intentioned man, devoted to the interests of England, but
                                without consideration or influence.</p>

                                favorite. From being secretary to Burleigh, Calvert rose to be
                                principal Secretary of State, was knighted, and at last ennobled.
                                Grants of estates in Ireland and of great unexplored tracts of
                                territory in the wilderness of America, pensions, sinecure offices,
                                grants of money out of increased customs fees, and presents from
                                those who had ends to serve at court, were the means by which a
                                successful courtier bettered his estate, and by some or all of these
                                Secretary Calvert thrived. That he did thrive is proved by the great
                                sum he was able to lose in his futile attempt to plant a colony in
                                Newfoundland. It was believed that he had accepted a share of the
                                money dispensed lavishly in presents and pensions to English
                                courtiers by Spain, but this Calvert denied, and one can believe <pb

                                the southeastern peninsula of that island which he had bought from
                                Sir William Vaughan. In this latter year (1621) he secured a grant
                                of the whole vast island, but in 1622 he accepted a re-grant of the
                                peninsula alone, and this became his first proprietary colony.
                                Captain Whitbourne&apos;s pamphlet on Newfoundland was just then
                                circulating gratuitously by the aid of collections made in the
                                churches with the sanction of royal authority. It described a
                                Newfoundland of Edenic fruitfulness. Even cool-headed statesmen like
                                Calvert appear to have been captivated by the stories of this
                                veteran seaman and weather-beaten romancer. Calvert called his new
                                province Avalon. The name signifies the land of applesthat is, the
                                fruitful country. In old British mythology it was the paradise of
                                the blessed, the island in the western seas to which King Arthur was
                                translated in the famous legend. This name of promise suited the
                                situation of the new island state, and fitted well the enthusiastic
                                tales of Whitbourne and the <pb id="VAA2449-240" n="225"/>
                                groundless hopes of Calvert. The bleak New-foundland coast had
                                already blossomed with fanciful names; there was the Bay of

                                proprietary charters, and Calvert himself bettered it but little in

                                for Englishmen of the Catholic faith? The question is not easily
                                answered. The primary design of the Avalon colony was, no doubt, to
                                better the fortunes of Sir George Calvert and to lift him and his
                                successors into the authority and dignity of counts-palatine in the

                                master of intrigue. He was bound by ties of friendship, and later by
                                the marriage of his son, to Lord Arundel of Wardour, a Catholic, and
                                the constitution of his mind and all the habits of a lifetime made
                                him a lover of authority in church and state. Under favoring

                                interests of the Catholic church, and a fresh exposure of his
                                co-religionists in England to a harsh persecution. Calvert was one
                                of that party in the junta for Spanish affairs which was unwilling
                                to break a solemn treaty in order to gratify the wounded vanity of
                                Buckingham and Charles, and he paid dearly for his firmness. To
                                bring about his resignation, his antagonists diverted business from
                                his office, thus reducing his fees and subjecting his pride to
                                mortification. Under this treatment it was noted by letter writer of
                                the time that Mr. Secretary Calvert &quot;droops and keeps out
                                of the way.&quot; It was reported that he was ill, and then that
                                he had been rebuked by the king and the prince, and it was known
                                that he wished to sell his office to some one acceptable to
                                Buckingham. Calvert&apos;s cleverness as a courtier did not fail
                                him in his fall. He succeeded at the last in mollifying Buckingham,
                                whose consent he gained to the sale of the secretaryship. After

                                at the same time raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Baltimore. He
                                made his religious scruples the ostensible reason for his
                                resignation, and he was already known to be &quot;infinitely
                                addicted to the Catholic faith.&quot; He made no secret of his
                                proscribed religion; he exposed to visitors the altar, chalice, and
                                candlesticks in his best room; and he catechised his children
                                assiduously in the doctrines of the ancient church. At the accession
                                of Charles he retired from the Privy Council rather than take an

                                from neglect. He now gave his new leisure to the work of rescuing
                                it. In 1627 he made a voyage to Newfoundland, taking a company of
                                Catholic settlers and two priests. He went again in 1628. From
                                Newfoundland he wrote to one of the Jesuits in England a letter of
                                affection, declaring his readiness to divide with him &quot;the
                                last bit&quot; he had in the world. In Avalon began the long
                                chapter of the troubles of the Baltimores with the Puritan
                                opposition. Besides his contentions with Puritan settlers, who
                                abhorred the mass as a Jewish prophet did idolatry, he found it
                                necessary to fight with French privateers bent on plunder. By <pb

                                quorum, and who probably transacted the business of this Council for
                                Virginia. Even under the government of the Company there had been
                                precedents for the establishment of a &quot;precinct&quot;
                                within Virginia independent of the Jamestown government. Such a
                                plantation had been that of Captain Martin and that proposed by Rich
                                and Argall, and a charter for such had been given to the Leyden
                                pilgrims. Baltimore wrote to ask <pb id="VAA2449-245" n="230"/> for

                                without molestation. Before another winter set in he abandoned
                                Avalon to fishermen and such hardy folk, and took ship for the James

                                as a councilor to assure him a welcome. But the Virginians of that
                                time were Sandys and Southampton men. They may have remembered that
                                Calvert had been Sandys&apos;s enemy and political rival, and
                                that he belonged to the faction of Sir Thomas Smyth in the company.
                                The members of that faction had been the executioners of the company
                                when they could no longer control it. Calvert was one of the later
                                council, which had tried to take away insidiously the privileges
                                granted to Virginians by their charter from the Virginia Company.
                                This attack on their liberties they had stoutly resisted, even to
                                cutting off a piece of one of the ears of the clerk of their own
                                assembly for abetting it. Now a nobleman of the detested faction, an
                                advocate of absolute government and a close friend of the king, had
                                come among them. Baltimore might easily expect to secure the
                                governorship of Virginia itself. Perhaps<note id="note_565"

                                <pb id="VAA2449-246" n="231"/> it is hardly necessary to go even so
                                far afield for a motive. The prospect of a settlement of Roman
                                Catholics within the limits of the colony was in itself enough to
                                excite the opposition of the Virginia churchmen.
                                Baltimore&apos;s party of Catholics was not the only one
                                repelled from Virginia about this time. Soon after Lord
                                Baltimore&apos;s visit, perhaps, or just before, the Virginians
                                refused permission to a company of Irish Catholics to settle within
                                their bounds. These appear to have gone afterward to the island of
                                St. Christopher&apos;s, where again Protestant fellow-colonists
                                fell out with them about religion, so that they were finally sent to

                                nobleman of the Court. It may have been meant only to head off
                                humble Irishmen like those who settled Montserrat, or it may have
                                been merely a fence against Separatists. But it served the turn of
                                the alarmed colonists. Pott and Mathews, Claiborne and Roger Smyth,
                                who led the opposition, offered the oath to Baltimore. Baltimore had
                                sacrificed his place in the Privy Council rather than take this oath
                                so contrary to his conscience, and he now again stood by his
                                religious convictions, and took ship for England as ordered by the
                                Virginia Council. He was disappointed and already shaken in health.

                                and the disappointment caused by his rude reception in Virginia,
                                were enough, one would think, to have broken his resolution. He went
                                back to England &quot;much decayed in his strength,&quot; as
                                he confessed; but, strangely enough, this accomplished man of the
                                world, whose career had been that of a courtier, was far from living
                                in ease and quietness as his friends had expected him to do. He was
                                possessed of a passion for peopling the wilderness. He had written
                                to the king from America that he was resolved to spend &quot;the
                                poore remaynder&quot; of his days in colony-planting, his
                                &quot;inclinations carrying him naturally&quot; to such
                                work. To what extent he was prompted by a desire to leave to his
                                heir the semi-sovereignty of a principality, and how far he was
                                carried by a naturally adventurous temper hitherto latent, we have
                                no means of deciding; but one can hardly resist the conclusion that
                                a fervent religious zeal was the underlying spring of a resolution
                                so indomitable. Like many another man of that time, Calvert was
                                lifted from worldliness to high endeavor by religious enthusiasm.
                                The king felt obliged to interpose his authority; he forbade
                                Baltimore&apos;s risking his life in another voyage, but he
                                granted him a charter for a new palatinate on the north side of the
                                Potomac.</p>

                                </note> of George Calvert&apos;s own hand. Its main provisions
                                are identical with those of Avalon; but it put the proprietary in a
                                still better position. He held Avalon by knight&apos;s service,
                                Maryland in free and common soccage, and the holdings of Maryland
                                settlers would be under the proprietary, not under the crown. In
                                fact, the crown retained practically no rights of value in Maryland
                                beyond the bare allegiance of the settlers. Larger privileges of
                                trade were conceded to Maryland than had been given to Avalon, In
                                one respect the liberties of the future settlers were apparently
                                better guarded in the Maryland charter, for there is a faint promise
                                of a representative government in its phraseology. But even this was
                                not definitely assured. In a single regard the charter of Maryland
                                appears less favorable to the Catholic religion than its
                                predecessors. Historic specialists with a religious bias, doing
                                their small best to render the current of history turbid, have not
                                failed to convince themselves by means of the new clause that
                                Maryland was a Protestant colony. The patronage and advowsons of all
                                churches had been conferred on the proprietary in the Avalon <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-250" n="235"/> charter, and a like concession is
                                made in the Maryland grant; but to this, in the Maryland charter, is
                                attached a sort of &quot;lean-to&quot; a qualifying clause
                                that appears to limit the ecclesiastical organization of the colony
                                to Anglican forms. &quot;Together with license and

                                Romanists. The clamor of the Catholic-baiters did not stop with a

                                the time of James when Avalon was granted. The clause which allowed
                                Baltimore to dedicate his churches according to the ecclesiastical
                                laws of England excites admiration. It graciously permitted an

                                fact, put any constraint whatever on his actions in this regard. The
                                impotent clause which seemed to limit, but did not limit, the
                                ecclesiastical organization was breathlessly followed by one far <pb

                                Calvert&apos;s skill. It gave to the proprietary the legal power
                                exercised from ancient times by the Bishops of Durham as
                                counts-palatine. The regalities of Durham having been pared down by
                                Henry VIII, the charter somewhat furtively reached back after the
                                local absolutism of the middle ages by giving Baltimore all the
                                temporal power ever possessed by<note id="note_577" place="left"

                                giving of powers so vast to a Roman Catholic subject, there might be
                                reassurance for timid souls in a clause in imitation of older
                                charters than Calvert&apos;s, which stipulated that no
                                interpretation should be put upon the charter by which
                                God&apos;s holy and true Christian religion might be prejudiced.
                                Ambiguity spread from the charter to some of the early Maryland
                                laws, which wore a Protestant or a Catholic face according to the

                                Irish Catholics. The statute enacted in the third year of James,
                                soon after the Gunpowder Plot, put those who adhered to the Roman
                                communion in a precarious and exasperating situation. For the first

                                went, was a large sum. If he were a rich landholder, the king might
                                take the use or rentals of two thirds of his land until he should
                                conform. The oath of allegiance by which he was to be tested was
                                made ingeniously offensive to a Catholic conscience. If a Romanist
                                should persuade a Protestant to accept his own faith he was guilty
                                of treason, as was also his convert. The man who harbored a Roman
                                Catholic neglecting to attend the parish church was to be fined ten
                                pounds a month. Marriage by a Romish priest invalidated accruing
                                land tenures. The Catholic was not suffered to send his children
                                beyond seas for an education, nor yet to keep a schoolmaster of his

                                he was not allowed to keep weapons; and when at last his vexed and
                                troubled life was over, his dead body might not be buried among the

                                Another of the good works by which the government of Charles and
                                Buckingham was endeavoring to prove its sanctification was the
                                enforcement of the penal statutes against Roman Catholics. It is
                                notable that Baltimore sailed with the first Catholic emigrants to
                                Avalon about the time of the setting in of the movement toward
                                Massachusetts which swelled at length into the great Puritan exodus.
                                The five years of delay caused by the change from Avalon to
                                Maryland, and also perhaps by the exhaustion of Baltimore&apos;s
                                resources and his death, was unfavorable to the project of a
                                Catholic province. The English government by 1634 had grown more
                                lenient toward Romanists, the co-religionists of the queen. The work
                                at which Laud kept all hands busy just then was the suppression of
                                Puritanism, and thousands of Puritans were by this time shaking the
                                dust of England from their feet and seeking a home in the western
                                wilderness, persuaded that the Church of England under Laud <pb

                                setting toward Catholicism. The small Catholic migration to Maryland
                                was not to be compared with that stream of Puritan emigration that
                                about this time poured into New England twenty thousand people in a
                                decade. The fall of Laud and the rise of the Puritans to power put a
                                complete stop to the New England migration, but it failed to quicken
                                the Catholic movement, for Maryland herself had become sadly

                                another tale that found believers was that they had soldiers on

                                Calvert&apos;s men had abused the customs officers at Gravesend,
                                and sailed without cockets in contempt of all authority, the people
                                on board refusing the oath of allegiance. The Ark was stopped and
                                brought back by order of the Privy Council, and the oath of
                                allegiance was given to a hundred and twenty-eight passengers. But

                                Society of Jesus privately furnished Baltimore with arguments in

                                situation was inexorable. Toleration and protection was all that

                                Calvert&apos;s, whose school was the court of James, and whose
                                whole career shows that he entertained no advanced views of human
                                liberty. Had he held toleration as a theory of government, his
                                doctrine would have been more liberal than <pb id="VAA2449-258"

                                opportunist. Still less was cecilius a man likely to act on general

                                malice of storm spirits and evil genii into landlocked waters and
                                the bounds of Lord Baltimore&apos;s grant, proceeded to sanctify
                                the whole region by sprinkling it with the names of saints and
                                angels from Michael the archangel downward. The ancient Indian
                                designations were marks of a heathenism they purposed to overthrow,
                                and they began by trying to get rid of the whole &quot;bead roll

                                they landed on Heron Island, in the Potomac, which they named
                                appropriately for St. Clement, who was martyred by being thrown into
                                the sea attached to an anchor, and here the sacrifice of the mass
                                was celebrated, the worshipers reflecting that &quot;never
                                before had this been done in this part of the world.&quot; After
                                the mass they took upon their shoulders a great cross hewn out of a
                                tree and advanced in order to the place appointed, where the

                                faith erected in a new land, knelt upon the ground and recited the
                                litanies of the cross in a kind of religious ecstasy. Here in
                                another form was that tender attachment to their faith that one
                                finds among the more devout Protestant exiles, and in the nobler
                                natures there was doubtless that element of the heroic and the

                                manifest care of the second Lord Baltimore to hold the missionaries
                                within the limits <pb id="VAA2449-262" n="246"/> of worldly
                                prudence, the zealous fathers lived and labored in a spirit of
                                other-worldliness. They set themselves first of all to convert those
                                sheep without a shepherd, the Protestants of Maryland. Some of these
                                appear to have been men of reckless and immoral lives, who were
                                greatly bettered by an acceptance of religious restraint. Those
                                non-Catholics who were ill, and those who found them-selves
                                languishing and dying in the wilderness without the consolations of
                                their own religion, were zealously visited and converted <hi
                                    rend="i">in extremis</hi> by the Jesuits. The servants and
                                mechanics employed by or apprenticed to the missionaries were
                                brought under their constant influence and were readily won. Nearly
                                all the Protestants who arrived in 1638 were swiftly brought over to
                                the faith of the missionaries, and twelve converts were joyously
                                reckoned as fruits of the Jesuit labors in 1639. There was more than
                                one instance of the miraculous, or at least of the marvelous, to
                                help on this work. One man of noble birth, who had by dissipation
                                brought himself to desperate straits, and then sunk until he became
                                at length a bond servant in Maryland, embraced Catholicism. After

                                from the Divine wrath against those who scoffingly rejected the
                                Catholic faith in Maryland remind one of the equal calamities that
                                befell those <pb id="VAA2449-263" n="247"/> who were unfaithful to
                                Puritanism in New England. Seventeenth-century Englishmen with
                                sky-wide differences in opinion were one in the traits that belonged
                                to their age. Father White was sure that the destruction of Indians
                                in Maryland was specially ordered by God to provide an opening
                                &quot;for His own everlasting law and light&quot;; but not
                                more sure than were the Puritans that the cruel plague which
                                exterminated whole villages on the Massachusetts coast was sent to
                                open a way for the planting of Calvinistic churches. Each division
                                of Christians in turn reduced the Almighty Creator to the level of a
                                special tutelary divinity, sometimes to that of a rather vindictive
                                genius of the place.</p>
                            <p>In this work of propagandism the missionaries did not forget the red
                                men. Their labors among the aborigines were fairly successful at
                                first, then interrupted by relapse and by war. Such is the history
                                of Indian missions. Much was made of the solemn profession and
                                baptism of an Indian &quot;king,&quot; at which the governor
                                and other distinguished men &quot;honored by their presence the

                                never able to afford to Catholics perfect security, much less was it
                                able to promise them domination. But the Catholics included most of
                                the rich and influential families, and it was a Jesuit boast that
                                they were superior to other American settlers in breeding and
                                urbanity. As they had choice of the best land in the province, the
                                Catholic families remained during the whole colonial period among

                                numerically considerable in proportion to the population, though the
                                reports on the subject are vague and conflicting. In 1641 they were
                                about one fourth of the whole. The ranks of the early Catholic
                                settlers, both of the rich and poor, seem to have been recruited
                                from Ireland as well as from England, but the Maryland government in

                                by the queen, who was godmother to Maryland. The opposition to

                                governor, hoping to collect money due him from the royal treasury by
                                Baltimore&apos;s assistance, was his obsequious tool, to the
                                bitter indignation of the Virginians, who hated Baltimore not only
                                because he was a Romanist, but also because he had divided the first
                                colony and cut off the northern Indian trade from Virginia. In
                                consequence of the quarrel between Harvey and the Virginians over
                                Maryland there ensued a revolution in Virginia; Harvey was shipped
                                to England by the same bold men who had sent the first Lord
                                Baltimore packing. But Harvey was sent back again by the king, and
                                by this counter revolution the colonial constitution of Virginia was
                                modified for the worse. It was altogether an exquisite revenge.</p>

                                after landing, and in one notable case of religious dissension after
                                the arrival in Maryland, justice was meted out against the Catholic
                                offender in a way that showed <pb id="VAA2449-267" n="251"/> a
                                disposition to observe this policy of conciliation toward
                                Protestants at the expense of some unfairness toward Catholics. Very
                                early a proclamation was issued for the suppression of all religious
                                disputes, and Copley, the business administrator of the Jesuits,
                                thought they ought to be put down for fear the writings should be

                                </note> necessary hypocrisy. The plan of toleration was also
                                inevitable, and it was carried no further than necessity required,
                                for in that age, when toleration was odious, a liberal policy had
                                also its perils. The Act for Church Liberties of 1639 was a fine
                                example of the studied ambidexterity of the Maryland government. It
                                was enacted &quot;that Holy Church within this province shall
                                have all her rights, liberties, and immunities, safe, whole, and
                                inviolate in all things.&quot; Holy Church here is a deliberate
                                substitution for &quot;the Church of England&quot; in a
                                similar phrase of Magna Charta. Such an act was worthy of
                                Bunyan&apos;s Mr. Facing-both-ways. Interpreted by judges
                                holding office at the will of a Catholic proprietary, it could have
                                but one meaning. For the outside world it might bear another sense.

                                him. If he could settle a portion of his province with Puritans they
                                might serve to shield him from the storm. Besides, the Catholic
                                emigration had not proved large, and his province needed
                                inhabitants. He wrote to a Captain Gibbons, of Boston, sending him a
                                commission under the Maryland government, and offering

                                new to his government, <pb id="VAA2449-269" n="253"/> and had
                                brought over with him plenty of hostility to the party that had
                                affronted his royal master in England. Virginia Puritans had no
                                choice but to suffer or depart, and Maryland was convenient. They
                                began soon after this to seek a refuge under the protection of a
                                proprietary who was a papist and who practiced tolerationtwo things
                                almost equally hateful to the Puritans. Mr. James, a Puritan
                                minister, tarried in Maryland a short time, as early as 1643; he was
                                probably the only Protestant minister that set foot on Maryland soil
                                before 1650. But the Puritan was never easy unless he was uneasy,
                                and he was sure to be uneasy within when there was none to molest
                                from without. To take an oath of fidelity to a papist was to him
                                swearing fealty to antichrist; but so desirous was Baltimore of
                                Puritan settlers that even the Maryland oath of fidelity was
                                modified, and a saving clause was inserted for the ease of the
                                Puritan conscience. The coming of Puritans who were in sympathy with
                                the Parliament in England and who abhorred a tolerant papist,
                                contributed something to the multifarious turmoils of the following

                                over <pb id="VAA2449-270" n="254"/> Kent Island; there was a

                                royal authority which was rending England; there was the tendency

                                there was perhaps a natural proneness to insurrection on the part of

                                Baltimore&apos;s own co-religionists were to be put under a
                                Protestant governor. Governor and high officers of state were
                                required to swear that they would molest on <pb id="VAA2449-271"
                                    n="255"/> account of religion no person professing to believe in
                                Jesus Christ, &quot;and in particular no Roman
                                Catholic.&quot; By the mere march of events it had come to pass
                                that in the state founded by Catholics as a cradle for the Roman
                                Catholic religion, the Catholic was now compelled to secure as best
                                he could the toleration of his religion at the hands of the heretic.
                                Part of Baltimore&apos;s plan for this new settlement of affairs
                                involved the sending over of a code of perpetual laws to be adopted
                                by the Assembly. The proprietary gave orders that the governor
                                should not assent to any of these laws if all were not passed; but
                                the Assembly of Maryland farmers was too cunning to be entrapped
                                into passing laws which it thought inconvenient and unjust. A humble
                                letter was sent from the members to the lord proprietary complaining
                                that they were &quot;illeterate&quot; and &quot;void of
                                that Understanding and Comprehension&quot; necessary to the
                                discussion of such a code, and that in April they were too busy with
                                their &quot;necessary employment in a Crop&quot; to give
                                attention to it. They selected certain acts out of the code which
                                they passed, among which was the famous Act of Toleration of 1649.
                                That this was part of the code sent from England there can be no
                                doubt; the &quot;illeterate&quot; colonists were not capable
                                of framing it, and it bears the character-mark of the Baltimore
                                policy throughout. Here is no philosophic theory of toleration, no
                                far-reaching conclusion like that of Roger Williams, that the
                                magistrate may not take <pb id="VAA2449-272" n="256"/> cognizance of
                                merely religious offences. Williams was a thinker, a doctrinary, too
                                far in advance of his age to be the successful organizer of a new
                                state. Baltimore, on the other hand, accepted a practical toleration
                                as an expedienthe may even have come to believe in it as a theory by
                                force of his own situation. But he was not primarily a thinker at
                                all. Even here, where Baltimorean toleration reaches high tide, no
                                philosophic congruity is sought. The Jew and the Unitarian who deny
                                the divinity of Christ are to be put to death. Only so much
                                toleration is granted as is needful to the occasion. And even this
                                toleration is not put upon any other ground than public policy; the
                                forcing of conscience in religion &quot;hath frequently fallen
                                out to be of dangerous consequence&quot;; therefore this law is
                                made &quot;to preserve mutual love and amity amongst the
                                inhabitants.&quot; The provisions against such offences as
                                blasphemy and Sabbath-breaking and religious disputes precede those
                                for toleration. Very politic is the arrangement by which reviling of
                                God is made a capital offence, while reviling the Virgin Mary is
                                adroitly associated with speeches against the &quot;holy
                                apostles or evangelists&quot; as a sort of second-class<note

                                only practical and quite incongruous. It was eminently prudent and
                                statesmanlike. That it was not perpetually effective was the fault
                                not <pb id="VAA2449-273" n="257"/> of Baltimore but of the times.
                                Puritan ideas were rampant. The government of the proprietary was
                                overthrown; the Jesuits fled to the inhospitable Virginia, where
                                they lived concealed in a low hut like a cistern or a tomb, not
                                lamenting their physical privations so much as the lack of wine
                                which deprived them of the consolation of the sacrament. The new
                                government of Maryland, five years after Baltimore&apos;s famous
                                &quot;act concerning Religion,&quot; passed a new act with
                                the same titlean act brusque and curt, a law with its boots and
                                spurs on. &quot;That none profess and exercise the papist
                                religion&quot; is its rude forbidding. The tables are turned; it
                                is no longer the nonresident Jew and the hypothetical Unitarian who
                                are excepted. But the wheels rolled swiftly once more, and in three
                                years Cecilius, absolute lord and proprietary, was again master of
                                Maryland, and the beneficent act of 1649 resumed its sway. It
                                protected the Catholic element, which, though always rich and
                                influential, came to be in latter colonial times but about a twelfth
                                of the population. Toleration also served to make Maryland an early
                                dwelling place for abounding Quakers and others holding religious
                                views not relished in colonies less liberal.</p>

                                employed in the Spanish match, so undoubtedly he did what good
                                offices he could therein for religion&apos;s sake, being
                                infinitely addicted to the Roman Catholic faith, having been

                                called Avalon, and that in the Christian legend Joseph of Arima-thea
                                began at Glastonbury the planting of the Christian religion in
                                Britain. See Anderson&apos;s Church of England in the Colonies,
                                second edition, i, 325, 326. This interpretation of
                                Calvert&apos;s intention in naming his colony was early given.

                                Calvert&apos;s first colony was sent out the Scotch settlement
                                in Newfound-land was of twelve years&apos; standing, while the
                                Bristol colony had been seated there five years. Calvert&apos;s
                                enterprise seems to have been pushed with more energy and with a
                                more liberal expenditure than its predecessors. Compare Whitbourne

                                discusses with acuteness the nature of the several colonial

                                Earl of Arundel, and Sir George Calvert. A &quot;grand

                                Calvert intended it to be a colony that should harbor Catholics, but
                                on the other hand the first settlers were chiefly Protestants, with
                                a clergyman of their own faith, and there seem to have been few

                                economy of a certain sort, verse in English and Latin, theology,
                                satire, and an incredible number of what-nots besides &quot;for
                                the generall and perpetuall good of Great Britain,&quot; found
                                in Vaughan&apos;s Golden Fleece, published in 1626. The nearness
                                of Newfoundland to Ireland and the comparative cheapness of
                                transportation thither, but especially the well-established value of
                                its fisheries and the market they afforded for the produce of the
                                colony, were the most plausible reasons for settling a colony there.
                                Probably there was a lurking purpose to turn the shore fishery into
                                a monopoly such as was contemplated by projectors for the New
                                England coast. The fact was insisted upon that part of Newfoundland
                                was &quot;equal in climate,&quot; or at least in latitude,
                                to &quot;Little Britain in France,&quot; or Brittany. Then,
                                too, Newfoundland is an island, and Vaughan at least persuaded
                                himself that &quot;Ilanders should dwel in Ilands.&quot; As

                                Governor of St. Kitts in 1634, speaks of the people of Montserrat as
                                &quot;pulsos ab anglis Virgini ob fidei Catholic
                                professionem.&quot; White&apos;s choice of words does not
                                necessarily imply, I suppose, an actual banishment from Virginia,
                                but at least a refusal of permission to come. Neither Edwards nor
                                Oldmixon mention this fact; but as White visited St. Kitts only two
                                years after the settlement at Montserrat, which was made immediately
                                from St. Kitts (according to Edwards) and was subject to the same
                                governor, his information was doubtless correct. There seems to have
                                been another project to plant Catholics in Virginia about this time,
                                unless, as is rather probable, we meet the same plan in another

                                acceptable, it was stated, somewhat diplomatically perhaps, that the

                                opinion the same doth not give him power to do anything contrary to
                                the ecclesiastical laws of England.&quot; This is as ingeniously
                                ambiguous as the clause itself. The attorneys-general and
                                solicitors-general during the eighteenth century set themselves to
                                the task of sub-ordinating colonial government to parliamentary
                                authority by a series of opinions in which they make rather than
                                explain law. In the present instance Northey was more modest than
                                usual, for he reaches a purely negative and impotent conclusion,
                                which Neill turns into a positive one in his text. Founders of
                                Maryland, 99. There is a collection of opinions on colonial subjects
                                rendered by the attorneys and solicitors-general in the first half
                                of the eighteenth century, in a volume at Landsdowne House which I
                                have examined. This collection was made, or at least furnished, for
                                the use of Lord Shelburne. Before Northey&apos;s opinion was
                                given the English Parliament had assumed power to override some
                                provisions of the Maryland charter, as is pointed out in
                                Abercromby&apos;s Examination, MS. at Landsdowne House, 47. How
                                slowly the Church of England grew in the colony may be inferred from
                                the statement made in 1677, that four clergymen have plantations and
                                settled &quot;beings&quot; of their owna phrase sufficiently

                                yett when he comes to make use of this Liberty He found very few who
                                were inclyned to goe and seat themselves in those parts But such as

                                Many there were of this sort of people who declared their

                                there through the proprietary, was in the minority. The
                                Massachusetts people, on the other hand, were fairly homogeneous in
                                religious opinion, and their government was admirably compacted. In
                                Massachusetts religious sentiment was a powerful centripetal force.
                                Magistrates and ministers were nicely poised, and each order relied
                                upon the other to maintain existing conditions. If the magistrates
                                were perplexed or were seriously opposed, the elders were called in
                                to advise or to lend a powerful ecclesiastical sanction to the
                                rulers. When any disturbance of church order was threatened, the
                                magistrates came to the front and supported the clergy with the
                                sharp smiting of the secular arm. In the magistracy and in the ranks
                                of the clergy were men of unusual prudence and ability. If the
                                little Puritan commonwealth seemed a frail canoe at first, it was

                                from the strait path of Puritanism in the direction of a return to

                                &quot;Anabaptism,&quot; in the direction of Arianism, and of
                                so-called Antinomianism. In the case of the Antinomians, the new
                                movement was able to shelter itself under the authority of the
                                younger Vane, then governor, and for a while under the apparent
                                sanction of the powerful Cotton. But no other religious disturbance
                                was ever allowed to gather head enough to become dangerous to the
                                peace and unity of the little state. Dislike as we may the
                                principles on which uniformity was enforced, we must admire the
                                forehanded statesmanship of the Massachusetts leaders in strangling
                                religious disturbances at birth, as Pharaoh&apos;s midwives did

                                precocious lad was employed in the Star Chamber in taking notes of
                                sermons and addresses in shorthand, and his skill excited the
                                surprise and admiration of Sir Edward Coke. Coke had found time, in

                                studies that brought him permanent renown, to defend the legacy

                                ever gained admission to that nursery of famous men. His natural
                                inclination to industry in his studies was quickened by the example
                                and encouragement of Coke, who was wont to say that he who would
                                harrow what Roger Williams had sown must rise early. From the
                                Charter House Williams went to Pembroke College, Cambridge. He early
                                manifested sincere piety and a tendency to go to extremes in his
                                Puritan scruples. Even in his father&apos;s house he had begun
                                to taste the bitterness of persecution. His eager temper transformed
                                his convictions into downright passions; his integrity was an
                                aggressive force, and there was a precipitation in his decisions and
                                actions that was trying to his friends. From an early<note

                                church by means of such compromises. Hooker and Cotton, two of the
                                greatest luminaries of that party and afterward the lights that
                                lightened New England, one day urged on the impetuous Williams the
                                propriety of temporarily conforming in the use of the common prayer.
                                By conceding so much to the judgment of his revered elders, Williams
                                would have removed the only obstacle to his advancement, for

                                minister. He took refuge, like other extreme Puritans, in a private
                                chaplaincy, and refused all compromise, in order, as he afterward
                                declared, to keep his &quot;soul undefiled in this point and not
                                to act with a doubting conscience.&quot; Most men feel bound to
                                obey conscience only where it clearly commands or forbids; good men
                                may act on the balance of probabilities where there is doubt; but
                                this young man would not do anything concerning which his moral
                                judgment felt the slightest halting. Here is the key to his whole
                                career; his strength lay in his aspiration for a soul undefiled; his
                                weakness, in that he was ever a victim to the pampered conscience of
                                an ultraist. Property of some thousands of pounds, that might have
                                been his had he been willing to make oath in the form required in
                                chancery, he renounced to his scruples. It certainly seemed rash in
                                a young <pb id="VAA2449-286" n="270"/> man just setting out in life,

                                England for safety. He fled hurriedly across country on

                                when he is excommnuicate of those he loves. His escape by sea was
                                probably the more difficult because he was unwilling to
                                &quot;swallow down&quot; the oath exacted of those who
                                emigrated. But he succeeded in sailing with his young wife, and in
                                1631 this undefiled soul, this dauntless and troublesome extremist,
                                landed in New England. He was invited to become one of<note

                                with the Boston congregation because of its position with reference

                                Massachusetts had a more Separatist tone than any other. In the
                                phrase of the time, no other churches in the world were so
                                &quot;pure&quot; as the New England churches, and Salem was
                                accounted the &quot;purest&quot; church in New England. Its
                                surviving minister, Skelton, and its principal layman, Endecott,
                                both tended to extreme Congregationalism; but the General Court of
                                the colony protested against the selection of Williams to be one of
                                the ministers of the Salem church. Skelton&apos;s Separatist
                                tendencies, Endecott&apos;s impetuous radicalism, and
                                Salem&apos;s jealous rivalry with the younger town of Boston,
                                were already sources of anxiety to the rulers. The addition of
                                Williams to these explosive forces was alarming. Williams&apos;s
                                ecclesiastical ideals were not those which the leaders of the <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-288" n="272"/> colony had devoted their lives and
                                fortunes to establish. Had this young radical been less
                                conscientious, less courageous, less engagingly good and admirable,
                                there would not have been so much reason to fear him. A letter was
                                written to Endecott protesting against Williams&apos;s
                                ordination, because he had refused communion with the church at
                                Boston, and because he denied the power of the magistrate to enforce

                                fishing. His body seems to have been vigorous, and no physical
                                fatigue abated anything of his mental activity. The Pilgrims had
                                passed more than twelve years in Holland, and almost every adult in
                                Plymouth must have known Dutch. Those of Roger Williams&apos;s
                                own age, who were children when they migrated to Leyden and men when
                                they left, probably spoke it as well as they did their mother

                                usual eagerness to acquire knowledge, now added Dutch to his stock
                                of languages; it is certain that he afterward taught Dutch to John
                                Milton. But he was still more intent on learning the language of the
                                natives, that he might do them good. He resolved not to accept
                                office as pastor or teacher, but to give himself to work among<note

                                prospect pleasing to him. He may have begun already to realize in a
                                half-conscious way that there was scant room in any organization for
                                such as he. The learning of the Indian language was an arduous toil
                                in more ways than one. &quot;God was pleased to give me a
                                painful patient spirit,&quot; wrote Williams long after,

                                advance were over, was a little disturbed by his speech. In his own
                                sweet, reckless way he sometimes sharply rebuked even the revered
                                Bradford when he thought him at fault. And in the interest of the
                                aborigines and of justice Williams laid before Governor Bradford a
                                manuscript treatise which argued that the king had no right to give
                                away, as he had assumed to do in his grants and charters, the lands
                                of the Indians merely because he was a Christian and they heathen.
                                That it was right to wrong a man because he was not orthodox in
                                belief could find no place in the thoughts of one whose conscience
                                was wholly incapable of sophistication. Bradford accepted candidly
                                the rebukes of Williams and loved him for his &quot;many

                                </note> Salem and its catastrophe, we must recall the character of
                                colonial life in Massachusetts at the time. There were already
                                sixteen settlements or &quot;towns&quot; on the shores of
                                Massachusetts Bay, with an indefinite stretch of gloomy wilderness
                                for background, the dwelling place of countless savages and wild
                                beasts. The population of all the settlements may have summed up
                                five thousand peopleenough to have made one prosperous village. The
                                inhabitants of the various towns of the bay were from different
                                parts of England; their dress and dialect were diverse, and their
                                Puritanism was of various complexions. The town system, at first a
                                reproduction on new soil of the township field communes that had
                                subsisted in parts of England from ages beyond the fountain heads of
                                tradition, <pb id="VAA2449-293" n="276"/> gave some play to local
                                peculiarities and prejudices. There is evidence that the central
                                government relieved itself from strain by means of this rural
                                borough system. The ancient town system in turn appears to have
                                taken on a new youth; it was perhaps modified and developed by the
                                local diversity of the people, and it lent to Massachusetts, at
                                first, something of the elasticity of a federal<note id="note_678"

                                which the settlers had once borne a part reached them at long
                                intervals, like news from an-other planet. But most of the time
                                these lonesome settlements had no interest greater than the petty
                                news and gossip of little forest hamlets. The visitor who came afoot
                                along Indian trails, or by water, paddling in a canoe, to Boston on
                                lecture day, might bring some news of sickness, accident, or death.
                                Sometimes the traveling story was exciting, as that wolves had
                                slaughtered the cattle at a certain place, while yet cattle were few
                                and precious. Or still more distressing intelligence came that the
                                ruling elder of the church at Water-town had taken the High-church
                                position that Roman churches were Christian churches, or that
                                democratic views had been advanced by Eliot of Roxbury. A new and
                                far-fetched prophetical explanation <pb id="VAA2449-294" n="277"/>
                                of a passage in the Book of Canticles, and a tale of boatmen wrecked
                                in some wintry tempest, might divide the attention of the people.
                                Stories of boats capsized, of boatmen cast on islands where there
                                was neither shelter nor food, of boats driven far to sea and heard
                                of no more, were staples of excitement in these half-aquatic towns;
                                and if the inmates of a doomed boat had been particularly profane,
                                these events were accounted edifyingdivine judgments on the ungodly.
                                When the governor wandered once and lost himself in the forest,
                                passing the night in a deserted wigwam, there was a sensation of a
                                half-public character. That a snake and a mouse had engaged in a
                                battle, and that the puny mouse had triumphed at last, was in one
                                budget of traveling news that came to Boston. To this event an
                                ominous significance was given by John Wilson, pastor of the Boston
                                church, maker of anagrams, solemn utterer of rhyming prophecies
                                which were sometimes fulfilled, and general theological putterer.
                                Wilson made the snake represent the devil, according to all sound
                                precedents; the mouse was the feeble church in the wilderness, to
                                which God would give the victory over Satan. Thus enhanced by an
                                instructive interpretation from the prophet and seer of the colony,
                                the story no doubt took up its travels once more, and now with its
                                hopeful exegesis on its back. The Massachusetts mouse was an
                                auspicious creature; it is recorded by the governor, and it was no
                                doubt told along the coast, <pb id="VAA2449-295" n="278"/> that one

                                spared a Greek Testament and a Psalter in the same covers.</p>

                                was one of the capital events in human history; that it had been
                                predesigned from eternity to plant here, in a virgin world, the only
                                true form of church government and to cherish a church that should
                                be a model to the Old World in turn, and a kind of foreshadowing of
                                the new heaven and the new earth. Some dreamed that the second
                                coming of Christ would take place among the rocky woodlands of New
                                England. The theocratical <pb id="VAA2449-296" n="279"/> government
                                was thought to be the one most pleasing to God, and a solemn
                                obligation was felt to import into this new theocracy the harsh
                                Oriental intolerance which had marked that fierce struggle in which
                                the Jewish tribes finally shook off image worship.</p>

                                </note> after Williams&apos;s return to Salem was John Cotton, a
                                Puritan leader in England, in whom devoutness was combined with
                                extreme discretion, a dominant will with a diplomatic prudence and a
                                temper never ruffled. Cotton&apos;s ingenious refinements made
                                him a valuable apologist in an age of polemics, but they often
                                served to becloud his vision of truth and right. He was prone to see
                                himself as he posed, in the character of a protagonist of truth. He
                                gave wise advice to the Massachusetts Puritans at their departure
                                from England. When, a few years later, Laud&apos;s penetrating
                                vigilance and relentless thoroughness made even Cotton&apos;s
                                well-balanced course of mild non-conformity impossible, he fled from
                                his parish of Boston, in Lincolnshire, to London, and escaped in
                                1633 with difficulty to the new Boston in New England. As John
                                Cotton had been the shining candle of Puritanism in England, his
                                arrival in America was hailed with joy, and from the time of his
                                settlement in the little capital his was the hand that shaped
                                ecclesiastical institutions in New England, and he did much also to
                                mold the yet plastic state. Though he usually<note id="note_684"

                                    id="VAA2449-297" n="280"/> every formidable rival he had left
                                Massachusetts early. Williams, Hooker, Davenport, and Hugh Peter all
                                found homes beyond the bounds of the colony. There can not be two
                                queen bees in one hive, nor can there well be more than one master
                                mind in the ecclesiastical order of a petty theocratic state. It was
                                the paradox of colonial religious organization that the Episcopal
                                colonies had parishes almost independent of all supervision, while
                                the New England Congregationalists were, from the arrival of Cotton,
                                subject to the dominance of ministers who virtually attained to the
                                authority of bishops.</p>

                                authorities at Boston. To subdue the refractory Salem was no doubt
                                one of the secondary purposes of the proceedings against Williams.
                                There seems to have been no personal animosity toward Williams
                                himself; his amiable character and his never-doubted sincerity were
                                main obstacles to his punishment.</p>

                                and magistrates of Massachusetts. Collision was not a matter of
                                choice on either side. <pb id="VAA2449-298" n="281"/> The
                                catastrophe was like one that comes from the irresistible action of
                                physical forces. In a colony planted at great cost to maintain one
                                chosen form of worship and subordinating all the powers of
                                government to this purpose, a preacher who asserted the necessity
                                for a complete separation of religion and government in the interest
                                of soul liberty had no place. His ideal was higher than the
                                prevailing one, but that age could not possibly rise to it.</p>

                                without holding office. An alarming report was soon in circulation
                                that he had written a book against the king&apos;s patent, the
                                foundation of the colonial authority. This treatise, we have said,
                                was written in Plymouth for the benefit of Governor Bradford. Like
                                many of the manuscript books that have come down to us, it appears
                                to have been a small quarto, and, if it resembled other<note

                                bound by its author in the favorite pigskin of the time. Williams
                                sent his book promptly to be examined. Some of the &quot;most
                                judicious ministers much condemned Mr. Williams&apos;s error and
                                presumption,&quot; and an order was made that he
                                &quot;should be convented at the next court.&quot; In the
                                charges no fault was found with the main thesis of <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-299" n="282"/> the book, that the king could not
                                claim and give away the lands of the Indians; but it was thought
                                that there were disloyal reflections cast upon both James and
                                Charlesat least those eager to condemn construed the obscure and
                                &quot;implicative phrases&quot; of Williams in that senseand
                                these supposed reflections were the subject of the charges. Williams
                                wrote a submissive letter, and offered his book, or any part of it,
                                to be burned after the manner of that time. A month later, when the
                                governor and council met, the whole aspect of the affair had
                                changed. Cotton and Wilson, the teacher and the pastor of the Boston
                                church, certified, after examination of Williams&apos;s quarto,
                                that &quot;they found the matters not so evil as at first they
                                seemed.&quot; It was decided to let Williams off easily. There
                                are some things unexplained about the affair; the eagerness of the
                                &quot;judicious ministers&quot; and court to condemn without
                                due examination, the failure even to specify the objectionable
                                passages at last, and the unwonted docility of Williamsall leave one
                                to infer that there was more in this transaction than appears. Laud
                                and his associates were moving to have the Massachusetts charter
                                vacated, and it may have seemed imprudent for the magistrates to
                                found their authority on a base so liable to disappear. If the
                                charter had been successfully called in, Williams&apos;s ground
                                of the sufficiency of the Indian title to lands might have proved
                                useful as a last resort. Williams asserted, long afterward, that
                                before his troubles began he had drafted a letter <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-300" n="283"/> addressed to the king, &quot;not
                                without the approbation of some of the chiefs of New
                                England,&quot; whose consciences were also &quot;tender on
                                this point before God.&quot; This letter humbly acknowledged
                                &quot;the evil of that part of the patent which
                                relates&quot; to the gift<note id="note_689" place="right"

                                of some sort; at least the Indians were content, and the little
                                quarto had at that time no practical bearing whatever, but that did
                                not matter to Williams. The more abstract a question of right and
                                wrong, the more he relished a discussion of it. It was of a piece
                                with his exquisite Separatism, a mere standing up in the face of
                                heaven and earth for an abstract principle. His purpose was not to
                                right a specific and concrete wrong, for there had been none, but to
                                assert as a broad principle of everlasting application that a
                                Christian king may not dispose of the land owned by heathens merely
                                because of his Christianity. Williams was not a judge or a lawgiver;
                                he was a poet in morals, enamored of perfection, and keeping his
                                conscience purer than Galahad&apos;s.</p>

                                </note> about the patent was called in question. Skelton, pastor of
                                Salem, died in the following August, <pb id="VAA2449-301" n="284"/>
                                and the Salem people, in spite of an injunction from the
                                magistrates, made Williams their teacher in his stead. The country
                                was now full of alarm at news from England that the charter was to
                                    be<note id="note_692" place="left" anchored="yes">

                                appointed, and that a force was to be sent to support his authority.
                                Laud was put at the head of a commission for the government of the
                                colonies in April, 1634. There could be no doubt of the meaning of
                                this measure. For more than a year the alarm in Massachusetts
                                continued. The ministers were consulted regarding the lawfulness of
                                resistance to force. A platform was constructed on the northeast
                                side of Castle Island, and a fortified house was proposed to defend
                                the platform. The trainbands were drilled, muskets,
                                &quot;bandeleroes&quot; or cartridge belts, and rests were
                                distributed to the several towns, and pikemen were required to learn
                                to use the cumbrous musket of the time. Puritans in England, angry

                                and a dissension concerning the power of the Upper House that
                                threatened trouble, the Court appointed the 18th of September a

                                avert the manifold disasters that threatened them. Roger Williams
                                was sure to speak like a prophet on such an occasion. He did not
                                stop at slashed garments, great sleeves, and headdresses with long
                                wings; he preached on eleven &quot;public sins&quot; that
                                had provoked divine wrath. We have no catalogue left us. The list
                                may have included some of those amusing scruples that he held in
                                common with other Puritans, or some of those equally trivial
                                personal scruples that Williams cherished so fondly. But no sermon
                                of his on public sins could fail to contain a declaration of his
                                far-reaching and cherished principle of religious freedom, including
                                perhaps a round denunciation of the petty inquisition into private
                                opinion which had been set up in Massachusetts. The Sabbath law, the
                                law obliging men to pay a tax to support religious worship, the
                                requirement that all should attend religious worship under penalty,
                                and the enforcement of a religious oath on irreligious and perhaps
                                unwilling residents, the assumption of the magistrate to regulate
                                the orthodoxy of a church under the advice of the ministers, were
                                points of Massachusetts law and administration that he denounced at
                                various times; and some of them, if not all, were no doubt put in
                                pillory in <pb id="VAA2449-304" n="287"/> this fast-day sermon in
                                the early autumn of 1634. Judged by modern standards, the sermon may
                                have had absurdities enough, but it was no doubt a long way in
                                advance of the General Court&apos;s mewling about lace, and
                                slashes, and long hair, and other customs &quot;prejudicial to
                                the general good.&quot; To this sermon, whatever it was,
                                Williams afterward attributed the beginning of the troubles that led
                                to his banishment.</p>

                                by Dudley, open and zealous advocate of religious intolerance.
                                Dudley, who was always hot-tempered, was for proceedings out of hand
                                with the bold &quot;teacher&quot; of the church in Salem,
                                but he felt bound to consult with the ministers first, since
                                Williams was an &quot;elder,&quot; and even among Puritans
                                there was a sort of benefit of clergy. Cotton had developed a
                                complete system of church-state organization hammered out of, or at
                                least supported by, Bible texts linked by ingenious inferences, and
                                from the time of Cotton&apos;s arrival there was a strong effort
                                to secure uniformity. But Cotton was timid in action, and he was
                                nothing if not orderly and ecclesiastical. Williams was an elder,
                                entitled as such to be proceeded with &quot;in a church
                                way&quot; first. As leader and spokesman of the clergy Cotton
                                expressed his charitable conviction that Williams&apos;s
                                &quot;violent <pb id="VAA2449-305" n="288"/> course did rather
                                spring from scruple of conscience than from a seditious
                                principle.&quot; The clergy proposed to try to convert him by
                                argument, not so much, perhaps, from hope of success as from a
                                conviction that this was the orderly and scriptural rule. Dudley,
                                impatient to snuff out Williams at once, replied that they
                                &quot;were deceived in him if they thought he would
                                    condescend<note id="note_700" place="left" anchored="yes">

                                </note> to learn of any of them.&quot; But the
                                &quot;elders&quot; now proceeded in the roundabout way
                                prescribed by Cotton&apos;s system ingeniously deduced from
                                Scripture. The individual church must deal with its own member; the
                                sister churches might remonstrate with a church. Cotton and Wilson,
                                for example, could appeal to the Boston church to appeal to the
                                Salem church to appeal to Williams, and in this order much of the
                                correspondence went on.</p>

                            <p>The most substantial grievance of the rulers against Williams was his
                                opposition to &quot;the oath.&quot; In order to make sure of
                                the loyalty of the residents in this time of danger a new oath of
                                fidelity to be taken by residents had been promulgated. Practical
                                men are wont to put aside minor scruples in time of danger. David
                                eats the sacred shew-bread when he is famishing: but Williams would
                                rather starve than mumble a crumb of it. He did not believe in
                                enforced oaths; they obliged the wicked man to a religious act, and
                                thus invaded the soul&apos;s freedom. Cotton says that
                                Williams&apos;s scruples excited such an opposition to the oath
                                that the magistrates were not able to enforce it. He thus
                                unwittingly throws a strong light on the<note id="note_703"

                                </note> weakness of the age, and extenuates the conduct of Williams
                                as well as that of the rulers. The age was in love with
                                scrupulosity, and Williams on this side was the product of his time.
                                In such an age a scruple-maker of ability and originality like
                                Williams might be a source of danger.</p>

                                </note> times &quot;convented&quot; before the Court. He was
                                charged with having broken his promise not to speak about the
                                patent, with opposing the residents&apos; oath, with maintaining
                                certain scruples in opposition to the customs of the times, as that
                                a man should not return thanks after a meal, or call on an
                                unregenerate child to give thanks for his <pb id="VAA2449-307"
                                    n="290"/> food. These were not more trivial certainly than half
                                a hundred scruples then prevalent, but they chanced to be
                                unfashionablea damning fault in a scruple. The sense of proportion
                                was feeble in religionists of that day, and neither Williams nor his
                                opponents understood the comparative magnitude of his greater
                                contentions, and the triviality of those petty scruples about which,
                                like the whole Puritan world, he was very busy. Religious freedom
                                and the obligation of grace after meat could then be put into the
                                same category. As years went by, although the mind of Williams was
                                never disentangled from scrupulosity, he came to see clearly what
                                was the real battle of his life. No better fortune can befall a
                                great spirit than such a clarification of vision. The extended works
                                of Williams&apos;s later life are written mainly to overthrow
                                the &quot;bloody tenent of persecution.&quot; It was this
                                championship of soul liberty as the weightiest matter of the law
                                that lifted him above all others who paid tithes of their little

                                of the magistrates, but Roger Williams could not be overborne.

                                The great Hooker was set to dispute with him. Hooker&apos;s
                                refined arguments were drawn out by inferences linked to inferences.
                                He proved to the satisfaction of everybody but the culprit that it
                                was not lawful for Williams, with his opinions, to set food before
                                his unregenerate child, since he did not allow an irreligious child
                                to go through the form of giving thanks. But the wiredrawn logic of
                                Hooker, though Williams could not always answer it, had no more
                                influence with him than the ingenious sophistications of the pious
                                Cotton; Williams constantly fell back upon the &quot;rockie
                                strength&quot; of his principles. On the 9th of October, 1635,
                                he was sentenced to banishment. After the manner of that curious
                                age, his banishment was based on charges of great importance mixed
                                with charges utterly trivial. His denial of the authority of the

                                had been also dealt with, the natural yielding of the Salem church
                                after a while to the pressure from the General Court, and to the
                                desire of the townsmen to secure the lands at Marble Neck, put a
                                strain on Williams which, added to his necessary toil in the field,
                                broke his health and he fell ill. The General Court probably also
                                felt the recoil of its act. When six weeks had expired consent was
                                given that Williams should remain during the winter provided he
                                would refrain from preaching. But Williams was in Salem, and in
                                Salem he was the center of interestjust now he was the center of

                                persons had definitely adhered to the opinions of their former
                                teacher, unconvinced by the argument of the rod of justice applied
                                to Endecott and Sharpe, or by the valuable land on Marble Neck.
                                These disciples proposed to remove in the spring with Williams to
                                the shores of Narragansett Bay. This might meet the approval of the
                                sagacious and kindly Winthrop, who had directed Williams&apos;s
                                attention to that promising place, and who foresaw perhaps the
                                usefulness of such a man in the dangerous Indian crisis now
                                threatening the colony. But to devotees of uniformity, the prospect
                                of a community on the very border of the land of the saints
                                tolerating all sorts of opinionists was insufferable. When once the
                                civil government weights itself with spiritual considerations, its
                                whole equilibrium is disturbed. Liberty and justice seem
                                insignificant by the side of the immensities. The magistrates, or a
                                part of them, were alarmed at the prospect of a settlement of the

                                rescue of imperiled souls is to be considered? A warrant was
                                dispatched ordering him to Boston within a certain time. Probably
                                knowing what was in store for him, he protested that it would be
                                dangerous for him, in view of his health, to make the journey, and
                                some of the Salem people went to Boston in his behalf, and, as was
                                natural in the circumstances, made exaggerated representations
                                regarding his physical condition. But the magistrates had other

                                in whom were mingled about equally devoutness, military courage, and
                                incorrigible lewdness, to bring Williams by sea in a shallop.
                                Williams was probably informed of their purpose, for, while
                                Underhill in his little craft was beating up to Salem in wintry seas
                                on an errand so congenial, expecting perhaps to come upon his quarry
                                unawares, Williams was fleeing from one hamlet of bark wigwams to
                                another. Here among the barbarians he was sure of faithful friends
                                and secure concealment. Underhill found <pb id="VAA2449-313" n="296"

                                because they &quot;were loath to displease the Bay.&quot; It
                                was not enough to drive a heretic from the bounds of Massachusetts;

                                which he named Providence. He planted the germinal settlement of the
                                first state in the world that founded religious liberty on the

                                banishment of Williams. It has been argued by more than one writer
                                that it was not a case of religious persecution at all, but the
                                exclusion of a man dangerous to the state. Cotton, with
                                characteristic verbal legerdemain, says that Williams was
                                &quot;enlarged&quot; rather than banished. The case has even
                                been pettifogged in our own time by the assertion that the
                                banishment was only the action of a commercial company excluding an
                                uncongenial person from its territory. But with what swift
                                indignation would the Massachusetts rulers of the days of Dudley and
                                Haynes have repudiated a plea which denied their magistracy! They
                                put so strong a pressure on Stoughton, who said that the assistants
                                were not magistrates, that he made haste to renounce his pride of
                                authorship and to deliver his booklet to be officially burned, nor
                                did even this prevent his punishment. The rulers of &quot;the
                                Bay&quot; were generally frank advocates of religious
                                intolerance; they regarded toleration as a door set open for the
                                devil to enter. Not only did they punish for unorthodox expressions;
                                they even assumed to inquire into private beliefs. Williams was only

                                authorities in church and state, Catholic and Protestant, prelatical
                                and Puritan, agreed in their detestation of it. Even Robinson, the
                                moderate pastor of the Leyden Pilgrims, ventured to hold only to the
                                &quot;toleration of tolerable opinions.&quot; This was the
                                toleration found at Amsterdam and in some other parts of the Low
                                Countries. Even this religious sufferance which did not amount to
                                liberty was sufficiently despicable in the eyes of that intolerant
                                age to bring upon the Dutch the contempt of Christendom. It was a
                                very qualified and limited toleration, and one from which Catholics
                                and Arminians were excluded. It seems to have been that practical
                                amelioration of law which is produced more effectually by commerce
                                than by learning or religion. Outside of some parts of the<note

                                by legerdemain. Notwithstanding his natural gift for devoutness and
                                his almost immodest godliness, Cotton was incapable of high
                                sincerity. He would not specifically advise Williams&apos;s
                                banishment, but having labored with him round a corner according to
                                his most approved ecclesiastical formula, he said, &quot;We have
                                no more to say in his behalf, but must sit down&quot;; by which
                                expression of passivity he gave the signal to the &quot;secular
                                arm&quot; to do its worst, while he washed his hands in innocent
                                self-complacency. When one scrupulous magistrate <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-318" n="300"/> consulted him as to his obligation in
                                Williams&apos;s case, Cotton answered his hesitation by saying,
                                &quot;You know they are so much incensed against his course that
                                it is not your voice nor the voice of two or three more that can

                                responsibility for the results of his own teaching. Of the

                                jot. Williams may be a little too severe, but he has some truth when
                                he describes Cotton on this occasion as &quot;swimming with the
                                stream of outward credit and profit,&quot; though nothing was
                                further from Cotton&apos;s conscious purpose than such
                                worldliness. Cotton&apos;s intolerance was not like that of
                                Dudley and Endecott, the offspring of an austere temper; it was
                                rather the outgrowth of his logic and his reverence for authority.

                                put Williams out of the Massachusetts theocracy as they would have
                                driven the devil out of the garden of Eden. When, however, it comes

                                judges and the imprecatory Psalms. The Apocalypse of John,
                                grotesquely interpreted, was the one book of the New Testament that
                                received hearty consideration, aside from those other New Testament
                                passages supposed to relate to a divinely appointed ecclesiasticism.

                                himself of a swarm of scruples as pertinacious as the buzzing
                                mosquitoes in the primitive forest about him. In <pb

                                to date at all, he never writes the ordinary name of the day of the
                                week or the name of the month, lest he should be guilty of
                                etymological heathenism. He often avoids writing the year, and when
                                he does insert it he commits himself to the last two figures only
                                and adds a saving clause. Thus 1652 appears as &quot;52 (so
                                called),&quot; and other years are tagged with the same doubting

                                does not allow him even to seem to hold ecclesiastical fellowship
                                with the man he honors as a ruler and loves as a friend. Once at

                                </note> power of every ecclesiastical agitation of that age. The
                                notion of a succession of churchly order and ordinance from the time
                                of the apostles was the <pb id="VAA2449-321" n="303"/> mainspring of
                                the High-church movement. Apostolic primitivism was the aim of the
                                Puritan and still more the goal of the Separatist. One party
                                rejoiced in a belief that a mysterious apostolic virtue had trickled
                                down through generations of bishops and priests to its own age; the
                                other rejoiced in the destruction of institutions that had grown up
                                in the ages and in getting back to the primitive nakedness of the
                                early Christian conventicle. True to the law of his nature, Roger
                                Williams pushed this latter principle to its ultimate possibilities.
                                If we may believe the accounts, he and his followers at Providence
                                became Baptists that they might receive the rite of baptism in its
                                most ancient Oriental form. But in an age when the fountains of the
                                great deep were utterly broken up he could find no rest for the
                                soles of his feet. It was not enough that he should be troubled by
                                the Puritan spirit of apostolic primitivism; he had now swung round
                                to where this spirit joined hands with its twin, the aspiration for
                                apostolic succession. He renounced his baptism because it was
                                without apostolic sanction, and announced himself of that sect which
                                was the last reduction of Separatism.<note id="note_738"

                                </note> The Seekers had appeared there long before. Many Baptists
                                had found that their search for primitivism, if persisted in,
                                carried them to this negative result; for it seemed not enough to
                                have apostolic rites in apostolic form unless they were <pb
                                    id="VAA2449-322" n="304"/> sanctioned by the
                                &quot;gifts&quot; of the apostolic time. The Seekers
                                appeared in England as early as 1617, and during the religious
                                turmoils of the Common-wealth period the sect afforded a resting
                                place for many a weatherbeaten soul. As the miraculous gifts were
                                lost, the Seekers dared not preach, baptize, or teach; they merely
                                waited, and in their mysticism they believed their waiting to be an
                                &quot;upper room&quot; to which Christ would come. It is
                                interesting to know that Williams, the most romantic figure of the
                                whole Puritan movement, at last found a sort of relief from the
                                austere externalism and ceaseless dogmatism of his age by traveling
                                the road of literalism until he had passed out on the other side
                                into the region of devout and contented uncertainty.</p>

                                regions of thought and sentiment in which he was wholly disentangled
                                from the meshes of his time, and that not because of intellectual
                                superiorityfor he had no large philosophical viewsbut by reason of
                                elevation of spirit. Even the authority of Moses could not prevent
                                him from condemning the harsh severity of the New England capital
                                laws. He had no sentimental delusions about the character of the
                                savageshe styles them &quot;wolves endued with men&apos;s
                                brains&quot;; but he constantly pleads for a humane treatment of
                                them. <pb id="VAA2449-323" n="305"/> All the bloody precedents of
                                Joshua could not make him look without repulsion on the slaughter of
                                women and children in the Pequot war, nor could he tolerate
                                dismemberment of the dead or the selling of Indian captives into
                                perpetual slavery. From bigotry and resentment he was singularly
                                free. On many occasions he joyfully used his ascendency over the
                                natives to protect those who kept in force against him a sentence of
                                perpetual banishment. And this ultra-Separatist, almost alone of the
                                men of his time, could use such words of catholic charity as those
                                in which he speaks of &quot;the people of God wheresoever
                                scattered about Babel&apos;s banks either in Rome or
                                England.&quot;</p>

                                intuitions, his moral insight, his genius for justice, lent a
                                curious modernness to many of his convictions. In a generation of
                                creed-builders which detested schism he became an individualist.
                                Individualist in thought, altruist in spirit, secularist in
                                governmental theory, he was the herald of a time yet more modern
                                than this laggard age of ours. If ever a soul saw a clear-shining
                                inward light not to be dimmed by prejudices or obscured by the deft
                                logic of a disputatious age, it was the soul of Williams. In all the
                                region of petty scrupuulosity the time-spirit had enthralled him;
                                but in the higher region of moral decision he was utterly
                                emancipated from it. His conclusions belong to ages yet to come.</p>

                                </note> prophetic temperament. Bradford and Winthrop were men of
                                high aspiration, but of another class. The reach of their spirits
                                was restrained by practical wisdom, which compelled them to take
                                into account the limits of the attainable. Not that they consciously
                                refused to follow their logic to its end, but that, like other
                                prudent men of affairs, they were, without their own knowledge or
                                consent, turned aside by the logic of the impossible. Precisely here
                                the prophet departs from the reformer. The prophet recks nothing of
                                impossibility; he is ravished with truth disembodied. From Elijah
                                the Tishbite to Socrates, from Socrates to the latest and perhaps
                                yet unrecognized voice of our own time, the prophetic temperament
                                has ever shown an inability to enter into treaty with its
                                environment. In the seventeenth century there was no place but the
                                wilderness for such a John Baptist of the distant future as Roger
                                Williams. He did not belong among the diplomatic builders of
                                churches, like Cotton, or the politic founders of states, like
                                Winthrop. He was but a babbler to his own time, but the prophetic
                                voice rings clear and far, and ever clearer as the ages go on.</p>

                                Williams&apos;s enthusiastic nature gave a flush of color to his
                                statement of ordinary fact, the general correctness of which,

                                the church records of that early date are imperfect, and there is
                                every reason to accept the circumstantial statement of Williams.
                                That he refused to enter into membership with the church is
                                confirmed by Winthrop&apos;s Journal, 12th April, 1631, and such

                                from Salem to Plymouth he received a letter from Winthrop, which
                                appears to have intimated that no man under twenty-five ought to be
                                ordained. Williams explains in reply that he is &quot;nearer
                                upwards of thirty than twenty-five,&quot; but avers, &quot;I
                                am no elder in any church . . . nor ever shall be, if the Lord
                                please to grant my desires that I may intend what I long after, the

                                written if he had resigned the eldership before leaving Salem, but
                                they would have had much less pertinency.</p>

                                There is a quaint humor in what he says of it that is enhanced by

                                take the oath is offered by making the regulations for recording the
                                lands of freemen apply also to the lands of
                                &quot;residents&quot; presumably not church members and

                                result from the oath that would be prejudicial to religious freedom.
                                This is to suppose that Williams needed a practical <pb

                                is to suppose that Williams was not Williams. Practical men were
                                afraid the independence of Massachusetts would be lost; Roger
                                Williams was only afraid that Massachusetts would commit a public
                                sin in trying to escape the impending evil. A conscience undefiled
                                was his objective point in private and public life; safety, public
                                or private, was secondary.</p>

                                Court since, to prove that Williams&apos;s views on toleration
                                were not a cause of his banishment. If those views on toleration
                                were not a cause of his banishment. If those views had been the sole
                                cause, the decree would have been more comprehensible and defensible
                                in view of the opinions of the age. But the question about the
                                validity of the patent, the question of the protest written against
                                the course of the magistrates in blackmailing Salem into a refusal
                                to support him, the question of the freeman&apos;s oath, and,
                                what seems to have been deemed of capital importance, the question
                                of grace after meat, are all involved at one time or another. The
                                formal charges in what may be considered the beginning of the
                                banishment proceedings, the trial in July, as given by Winthrop, our
                                most trustworthy authority, are: 1. That the magistrates ought not
                                to punish for a religious offense&quot;the breach of the first
                                table&quot;except where it disturbed the civil peace. 2. That
                                the magistrate ought not to tender an oath to an unregenerate man.
                                3. That a man ought not to pray with an unregenerate person. 4. That
                                thanks were not to be given after the sacrament and after meat.

                                October, the letters growing out of the refusal to confirm to Salem
                                its outlying land entered into and embittered the controversy.
                                Winthrop, i, 204. The recorded verdict makes the divulging
                                &quot;of dyvers newe and dangerous opinions against the
                                aucthoritie of the magistrate&quot; the first offense, and the
                                &quot;letter of defamacion&quot; the second. Williams says
                                that a magistrate, who appears to have been Haynes, the governor,
                                summed up his offenses at the conclusion of the trial under four
                                heads: 1. The denial of the authority of the patent. 2. The denial
                                of the lawfulness of requiring a wicked person to take an oath or
                                pray. 3. The denial of the lawfulness of hearing the parish
                                ministers in England. 4. The doctrine &quot;that the Civill
                                Magistrates&apos; power extends only to the Bodies and Goods and
                                outward State of men.&quot; Against the evidence of Williams,
                                Winthrop, and the <pb id="VAA2449-328" n="310"/> records, I can not
                                attach any importance to the halting accounts given years afterward,
                                for controversial purposes, by Cotton, from what he thought was his

                                Records of the period. Some facts can be gathered from the writings
                                of Williams, whose autobiographical passages always have an air of
                                truth while they are sometimes vague and often flushed by his
                                enthusiastic <pb id="VAA2449-329" n="311"/> temper.
                                Cotton&apos;s memory is less to be trusted; some of his
                                statements are in conflict with better authorities. He no doubt
                                believed himself to be truthful, but his ingenious mind was unable
                                to be precise without unconscious sophistication. Hubbard was of
                                Presbyterian tendencies and totally opposed to all forms of
                                Separatism. He appears to have recorded every exaggerated rumor
                                cherished by Williams&apos;s antagonists to his discredit.
                                Neither in this nor in other matters can we rely much on
                                Hubbard&apos;s testimony. No critical student of history puts
                                unquestioning confidence in Cotton Mather. His strange mind could
                                never utter truth unvarnished. In a case like this, where family
                                pride, local feeling, and sectarian prejudice were all on one side,
                                and where he had a chance to embroider upon traditions already two
                                generations old, it is better to disregard the author of the
                                Magnalia entirely. Bentley&apos;s Historical Account of Salem,
                                in 1st Massachusetts Historical Society Collections, vi, is a paper
                                that excites admiration for its broadmindedness. It contains
                                information not elsewhere to be found, but it is impossible to tell
                                how lar Bentley depended upon sources not now accessible and how far
                                he relied on ingenious inferences drawn from his large knowledge of
                                local history. The publications of the Narragansett Club contain the
                                whole controversy between Cotton and Williams and all the letters of
                                the latter now known to be extant. I have in some cases referred to
                                the originals, in others I have used these careful reprints.
                                Williams has been rather fortunate in his biographers. Mr. Oscar S.
                                Straus, approaching the subject from a fresh standpoint, has
                                produced the latest Life of Williams, written in a judicial temper
                                and evincing a rare sympathy with its subject. The character of
                                Williams has never been better drawn than by Mr. Straus, pp. 231233.
                                The life by T. D. Knowles is perhaps the best of the older
                                biographies, Arnold&apos;s History of Rhode Island contains a
                                sketch of Williams, and Elton&apos;s brief biography has a value
                                of its own. Gammell&apos;s Life in Sparks&apos;s Biography
                                is generally fair. &quot;As to Roger Williams,&quot; by the
                                late Dr. Henry Martyn Dexter, is, what it pretends to be, a partisan
                                statement of the case against Williams. It shows characteristic
                                thoroughness of research, it clears up many minor points, and is as
                                erudite as it is one-sided.</p>

                                toleration. Williams alludes to the charge, Bloudy Tenent yet more
                                Bloudy, <pb id="VAA2449-330" n="312"/> p. 8. But the toleration of
                                Holland may rather be traced to that decay of bigotry and that
                                widening of view which are beneficent results of an extended trade.
                                Williams in the Bloudy Tenent yet more Bloudy, p. 10, complains of
                                the exclusion of Catholics and Arminians from toleration in the
                                Netherlands. It would carry us beyond the range of the present work
                                to inquire how far the toleration of Amsterdam wa related to that
                                &quot;meridian glory&quot; which Antwerp reached as early as
                                1550 by making itself a place of refuge for the persecuted of
                                England, France, and Germany. The Articles of Union, adopted at
                                Utrecht in 1579, which have been often called the Magna Charta of
                                the Dutch, go to show that political and commercial considerations
                                counted in favor of toleration, but they also show that some notion
                                of the sacredness of the free conscience had been adopted among the
                                Dutch, Article XIII of the Union provides that the states of Holland
                                and Zealand shall conduct their religious affairs as they think
                                good. More qualified arrangements are made for the other states, as
                                that they may restrict religious liberty as they shall find needful
                                for the repose and welfare of the country. But this significant
                                provision is added, that every man shall have freedom of private
                                belief without arrest or inquisition: &quot;Midts dat een yder

                                West Frisia, as the author, in 1609, of The Liberty of Religion, in
                                which he maintains that men are not to be converted by force. In
                                1614 one Leonard Busher petitioned James I in favor of liberty of
                                conscience, and Barclay conjectures that he was a member of that
                                Separatist or General Baptist church returned from Holland, of which
                                Helwyss had been pastor. In 1615 this obscure and proscribed
                                congregation professed a great truth, yet hidden from the wise and
                                prudent, namely, that &quot;earthly authority belonged to
                                earthly kings, but spiritual authority belonged to that one
                                Spiritual king who is king of kings.&quot; In more than one
                                matter Roger Williams showed himself attracted to the doctrines of
                                the Mennonites and their offshoot the English General Baptist body.
                                    <pb id="VAA2449-331" n="313"/> Whether directly through his
                                reading of Dutch theological works or indirectly through English
                                followers of Dutch writers, Williams probably derived his broadest
                                principles, in germ at least, from the Mennonites or Anabaptists of
                                the gentler sort, as he did also some of his minor scruples. For the

                                Providence was too small in number at first to be of great
                                importance. The emigration of Williams and his followers to the
                                Narragansett country was an example that may have turned the scale
                                with Hooker and his party in favor of a removal to the Connecticut
                                instead of to some place in the Massachusetts wilderness. Williams
                                certainly prepared a harbor for most of the Hutch-insonians, and
                                pointed the way to Gortonists, Baptists, Quakers, and all others of
                                uneasy conscience. Providence Plantation, and at times all Rhode
                                Island, fell into disorders inevitable in a refuge for scruplers and
                                enthusiasts established by one whose energies were centrifugal and
                                disintegrating. But when at length it emerged from its primordial
                                chaos the community on Narragansett Bay became of capital importance
                                as an example of the secularization of the state, and of the
                                congruity of the largest liberty in religion with civil peace. The

                                north and south that it might have no sacred east end, a chapel in

                                to the living of Chelmsford, in Essex. Here his eloquence attracted
                                wide attention, and unhappily attracted at the same time the notice
                                of his diocesan Laud, then Bishop of London, who drove the preacher
                                from his pulpit. Hooker engaged in teaching a school four miles from
                                Chelmsford, where Eliot, afterward the Indian apostle, became his
                                usher and disciple. But Laud had marked him as one to be brought

                                the greatest debater, perhaps, in the ranks of the Puritans. His
                                theology was somewhat somber, his theory of Christian experience of
                                the most exigent type.</p>

                                man&apos;s acceptance with God but his good works. Cotton was
                                less logical but more attractive. His Puritanism grew in a garden of
                                spices. He delighted in allegorical interpretations of the
                                Canticles, his severe doctrines were dulcified with sentiment, and
                                his conception of the inward Christian life was more joyous and
                                mystical and less legal and severe than Hooker&apos;s. He was an
                                adept in the windings of non-committal expression, and his
                                intellectual sinuosity was a resource in debate or difficulty.
                                Hooker, on the other hand, had a downrightness not to be mistaken.
                                With an advantage in temperament and the additional advantage of
                                position in the commercial and political center, it is not
                                surprising that Cotton&apos;s ideals eloquently and deftly
                                presented soon dominated the colony and that he became the Delphic
                                oracle whose utterances were awaited by the rulers in

                                justification. Hooker maintained all by himself that there was

                                and at first opposed him unanimously. No doubt, too, Hooker and his
                                disciples found some fault with the outer form of the church as
                                shaped by Cotton. Certain it is that Hooker&apos;s theories of
                                civil government were more liberal and modern than
                                Cotton&apos;s, though like Cotton&apos;s they were hung upon
                                texts of Scripture. Hooker lacked Cotton&apos;s superfluity of
                                ingenuity; he had less imagination and less poetic sentiment than
                                Cotton, but his intellect was more rugged, practical, and virile. He
                                was not a man to have visions of a political paradise; he did not
                                attempt to limit citizenship to church members when he framed a
                                constitution for the Connecticut towns. Nor did he give so much
                                power and privilege to the magistrate as was given in Massachusetts.
                                He disapproved of Cotton&apos;s aristocratic theory of the

                                would seem desertion. The government of the Massachusetts Bay colony
                                was anomalous; it partook of the character of the commercial company
                                from which it sprang, yet it had traits of a religious or at least a
                                voluntary society. It was the accepted opinion that those who had
                                taken the freeman&apos;s oath were &quot;knit&quot;
                                together &quot;in one body,&quot; and that none of them

                                a man to stand on the manner of his emigration. Waiting for

                                the Next year. These settled at what is now Wethersfield. From
                                Dorchester, which had no alewife fishery with which to enrich its
                                fields, settlers removed in 1634 to the Connecticut, where the soil
                                did not need to be &quot;fished.&quot; In 1635 the number of
                                emigrants was larger, and there was much suffering during the

                                nature which might almost have been predicted from the antecedent
                                circumstances. Puritanism had wrapped itself in the haircloth of
                                austerity, it took grim delight in harsh forbiddings, and heaped up
                                whole decalogues of thou-shalt-nots. Nor did it offer, as other
                                intense religious movements have done, the compensation of internal
                                joys for the gayety it repressed. Theoretically Calvinist, it was
                                practically an ascetic system of external duties and abstentions,
                                trampling on the human spirit without ruth.</p>

                                which Calvinism provided abundant materials. While preachers like
                                Hooker were scourging the soul into a self-abasement that could
                                approve its own damnation, and while ingenious scribes were amassing
                                additional burdens of scruple for heavy-laden shoulders, there arose
                                in England a new school of Puritan pietists. These shirked none of
                                the requirements of the legalists, but their spirits sought the
                                sunnier nooks of Calvinism, <pb id="VAA2449-346" n="328"/> and they
                                preached the joy of the elect and the delight of a fully assured

                                new order. He rejoiced that he had received the &quot;witness of
                                the Spirit&quot; on his wedding day, and he delighted to draw
                                out Scripture imagery to a surprising tenuity in describing the
                                &quot;covenant of marriage&quot; and the intimacy of the
                                &quot;covenant of salt&quot; or of friendship between God
                                and the soul of the believer. Preachers of the same sort brought
                                relief to multitudes in various towns of England. The people, tired
                                of churchly routine on the one hand and of legalism on the other,

                                philosophy of character than her desire to give to conduct a greater
                                spontaneity. Cotton himself preached in the same vein. In addition
                                to the Reformation, of which Puritans made so much, he looked for
                                something more which he called, in the phrase of the Apocalypse,
                                &quot;the first resurrection.&quot; Mrs. Hutchinson, who was
                                less prudent and more virile than Cotton, did not hesitate to
                                describe most of the ministers in the colony as halting under a
                                &quot;covenant of works.&quot; Her doctrine was, at bottom,
                                an insurrection against the vexatious legalism of Puritanism. She
                                carried her rebellion so far that she would not even admit that good
                                works were a necessary evidence of conversion. It was the particular
                                imbecility of the age that thought of almost every sort must spin a
                                cocoon of theological phrases for itself. Spontaneity of religious
                                and moral action represented itself to Mrs. Hutchinson and her
                                followers as an indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the believer and as
                                a personal union with Christ whom they identified with the
                                &quot;new creature&quot; of Paul. Such a hardening of
                                metaphor into dogma is one of the commonest phenomena of religious
                                thought.</p>

                                Cotton and that he should easily adopt the transcendental views of
                                Mrs. Hutchinson. Winthrop, the natural leader of the colony, having
                                given place in 1635 to Haynes, perhaps in order that
                                Hooker&apos;s party might be conciliated and the Connecticut
                                emigration avoided, was a second time thrust aside that a high-born
                                youth might be honored. Winthrop was utterly opposed to Mrs.
                                Hutchinson, in whose teachings his apprehensive spirit saw
                                full-fledged Antinomianism, and, by inference, potential anabaptism,
                                blasphemy, and sedition. The Hutchinsonians were partisans of Vane,
                                who adhered to their doctrine. The ministers other than Cotton and
                                Whelewright, stung by the imputation that they were under

                                tended to become fanaticism. We have to depend mainly on the
                                prejudiced account of their enemies, but there is little reason to
                                doubt that the advocates of &quot;a covenant of grace&quot;
                                assumed the airs of superiority usually seen in those who have
                                discovered a short cut to perfection. The human spirit knows few
                                greater consolations than well-disguised self-righteousness. The
                                followers of Mrs. Hutchinson, if we may believe the witnesses,
                                sometimes showed their sanctity by walking out of meeting when a
                                preacher not under &quot;a covenant of grace&quot; entered
                                the pulpit. They even interrupted the services with controversial
                                questions addressed to the minister. Wilson, pastor of the Boston
                                church, was condemned by them as being under &quot;a covenant of
                                works,&quot; and also incidentally criticised for his
                                &quot;thick utterance.&quot; Nor can one find that Cotton

                                quite conceivable that he looked with some satisfaction on the
                                progress of affairs in Boston. The heavenly minded young governor

                                disciple. The brilliant woman who was easily the leader of the town
                                was the very apostle <pb id="VAA2449-352" n="334"/> of his doctrine.
                                The superiority of his opinions on a union with Christ that preceded

                                church, led by Mrs. Hutchinson. Seeing so much zeal and sound
                                doctrine he may have felt that the first or spiritual resurrection

                                concentrated religiousness of a town that sought to shut out
                                unbelieving residents made the dispute dangerous. In the rising
                                tempest a ballast of ungodly people might have been serviceable. But
                                in Boston there were few even of the indifferent to be buffers in
                                the religious collision. While the covenant-of-grace people made

                                worksresorted to the favorite weapons of polemics. They hatched a

                                bantlings. They pretended to believe, and no doubt did believe, that
                                Mrs. Hutchinson&apos;s esoteric teaching was worse than what she
                                gave out. They borrowed the names of ancient heresies, long damned
                                by common consent, to give odium to her doctrine. That the new party
                                should be called Antinomian was plausible; the road they had chosen
                                for escape from Puritan legalism certainly lay in that direction.
                                But Antinomianism had suffered from an imputation of immorality, and
                                no such tendency was apparent, unless by logical deduction, in the
                                doctrines taught in Boston. The hearers of Mrs. Hutchinson were also
                                accused of having accepted the doctrines of the so-called Family of
                                Love which had of old been accused of many detestable things, and
                                was a common bugaboo of theology at the time. The whole town of
                                Boston and the whole colony of Massachusetts was set in commotion by
                                the rude theological brawl. Such was the state of combustion in
                                Boston that it was<note id="note_828" place="right" anchored="yes">

                                points of doctrine. The governor frequently had to interpose to keep
                                the peace; sometimes he adjourned the assembly, to give time for
                                heats to cool. A long list of errors, most of which were not held by
                                anybody in particular, were condemned. A nearly unanimous conclusion
                                on certain fine-spun doctrines was reached at length by means of
                                affirmations couched in language vague or ambiguous. Cotton, who had
                                been forced after debate to recant one opinion and modify others,
                                assented to the inconclusive conclusions, but with characteristic
                                non-committalism he qualified his assent and withheld his

                                punished. The banished included some of the most intelligent and
                                conspicuous residents. Not until this November court had her
                                opponents ventured to bring Mrs. Hutchinson to trial. Whelewright,
                                standing by his hot-headed sermon, had just been sentenced; the
                                abler but more timid Cotton had already been overborne and driven
                                into a safe ambiguity by the tremendous pressure of the great synod.
                                Vane had left the colony, and the time was ripe to finish the work

                                the conscientious advocate of persecution, was rude and overbearing.
                                Winthrop acted as chief inquisitor, the narrow sincerity and
                                supersition of his nature obscuring the nobler qualities of the
                                man.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Hutchinson defended herself adroitly at first, refusing to be
                                trapped into self-condemnation. But her natural part was that of an
                                outspoken agitator, and her religious exaltation had been increased,
                                doubtless, by persecution, for combativeness is a stimulant even to
                                zeal. On the second day she threw away &quot;the fear of
                                man,&quot; and declared that she had an inward assurance of her
                                deliverance, adding that the General Court would suffer disaster.
                                For this prophesying she was promptly condemned. Cotton had
                                prophesied notably on one occasion, Wilson, his colleague, was given
                                to rhyming prophecies, and Hooker had made a solemn prediction while
                                in Holland. In this very year the plan of the Pequot campaign had
                                been radically changed in compliance with a revelation vouchsafed to
                                the chaplain, Stone. But these were ministers, and never was the
                                ministerial office so reverenced as by the Puritans, who professed
                                to strip it of every outward attribute of priestliness. Above all,
                                for a woman to teach and to have revelations was to stand the world
                                on its head. &quot;We do not mean to discourse with those of

                                Winthrop severely to Mrs. Hutchinson during the trial. She was

                                persuasion of Cotton and others, Mrs. Hutchinson wrote a recantation
                                apologizing for her assumption to have revelations, and retracting
                                certain opinions of which she had been accused. But she added that
                                she had never intended to teach or to hold these opinions. For this
                                    false-hood,<note id="note_837" place="right" anchored="yes">

                                excommunicated except by unanimous consent. Many of Mrs.
                                Hutchinson&apos;s friends were absent from the colony, others
                                had prudently changed sides or stayed away from the meeting. But her
                                sons ventured to speak in her behalf. Cotton at once admonished
                                them. The effect of putting them under admonition was to
                                disfranchise them; it was one of Cotton&apos;s ingenuities of
                                the sanctuary. The sons out of the way, the mother was cast out

                                believed that what was thus bound on earth was bound in heaven. It
                                was a ban that forbade the faithful even to eat with her. But the
                                melancholy under which Mrs. Hutchinson had suffered vanished at
                                once, and she said as she left the church assembly, &quot;Better

                                with the excommunicated Mrs. Hutchinson. Winthrop had the
                                monstrosity exhumed after long burial had rendered its traits
                                difficult to distinguish. He examined it personally with little

                                tales about it. God stepped in once more, and Mrs. Hutchinson

                                misfortune of another kind. The wild reports that were circulated

                                signalize her error in denying inherent righteousness. The governor,
                                who was more cautious, wrote to the physician and got a correct
                                report, from which the divine purpose was not so evident, and Cotton

                                </note> the character of the age and the nature of Puritanism. It is
                                one of many incidents that reveal the impracticability of the
                                religious Utopia attempted in New England. The concentration of
                                religious people undoubtedly produced a community free from the kind
                                of disorders that are otherwise inseparable from a pioneer state and
                                that were found abundantly in New Netherland, in Maryland, and in
                                Virginia and on the eastward fishing coast. &quot;These English
                                live soberly,&quot; said a Dutch visitor to Hartford in 1639,
                                &quot;drinking but three times at a meal, and when a man drinks
                                to drunkenness they tie him to a post and whip him as they do
                                thieves in Holland.&quot; But while some of the good results to
                                be looked for in an exclusively Puritan community were attained, it
                                was at the cost of exaggerating the tendency to debate and
                                fanaticism and developing the severity, the intolerance, and the
                                meddle-some petty tyranny that inheres in an ecclesiastical system
                                of government. During the lifetime of one generation Massachusetts
                                suffered all these, and it is doubtful whether regularity of morals
                                was not purchased at too great a sacrifice of liberty, bodily and
                                spiritual, and of justice. Certainly the student of history views
                                with relief the gradual relaxation that came after the English
                                Restoration and the disappearance from the scene of the latest
                                survivors of the first generation of New England leaders.</p>

                                minister of London, had been in Massachusetts. Like many other
                                emigrant divines of the time he brought a migrant parish with him
                                seeking a place to settle. Davenport arrived in June, 1637, and took
                                part against the Antinomians in the synod. After examining every
                                place offered them in Massachusetts, he and his friends refused all
                                and resolved to plant a new colony. The people were Londoners and
                                bent on trade, and Massachusetts had no suitable place for their
                                settlement left. The bitterness of the Hutchinson controversy may
                                have had influence in bringing them to this decision, and the
                                preparations of Laud to subject and control Massachusetts perhaps
                                had weight in driving them to seek a remoter settlement. Davenport
                                had ideals of his own, and the earthly paradise he sought to found
                                was not quite Cotton&apos;s nor was it Hooker&apos;s. He and
                                his followers planted the New Haven colony in 1638. In this little
                                colony church and state were more completely blended than in
                                Massachusetts. The government was by church members only, to the
                                discontent of other residents, and in 1644 New Haven adopted the
                                laws of Moses in all their rigor. The colony was united with
                                Connecticut by royal charter at the Restoration, after which the
                                saints no longer sat upon thrones judging the tribes of Israel.</p>

                                augmented perhaps by agricultural distress. Fourteen ships bound for
                                New England lay in the Thames at one time in the spring of that
                                year. There was alarm at the great quantity of corn required for the
                                emigrants, lest there should not be enough left in London to last
                                till harvest. &quot;Divers clothiers of great trading&quot;

                                planting compact agricultural communities. A sedentary and farming
                                population where the supply of land is not limited reaches the
                                highest rate of natural increase. At a later time, Franklin
                                estimated that the population of the colonies doubled every
                                twenty-five years without including immigrants. The compactness of
                                English settlement and the prolific increase of English people
                                decided the fate of North America. The rather thin shell of Dutch
                                occupation was already, by the middle of the seventeenth century,
                                feeling the pressure under stress of which it was soon to give way.
                                A century later collision with the populous and ever-multiplying
                                English settlements brought about the collapse of the expanded

                                &amp; Mr. Cotton in Newe England. 1. That a man may prove his

                                and only cheife evidence of his salvation. 2. Whither fayth be
                                active or passive in justification. 3. Whither there be any saving
                                preparation in a Christian soule before his unyon with Christ. This
                                latter is only Hooker&apos;s opinion, the rest of the ministers
                                do not concurr with him: Cotton and the rest of the contrary opinion

                                Synod, which met August 30th, had adjourned late in September, and
                                the debates <pb id="VAA2449-366" n="347"/> which divided the two
                                divines must have preceded it, and perhaps preceded the migration of
                                Hooker to Connecticut in 1636. When Haynes was Governor of
                                Massachusetts he had pronounced the sentence of banishment against
                                Williams. But some years later, while Governor of Connecticut, he
                                relented a little and wrote to Williams: &quot;I think, Mr.
                                Williams, I must now confesse to you, that the most wise God hath
                                provided and cut out this part of his world for a refuge and
                                receptacle for all sorts of consciences. I am now under a cloud, and
                                my brother Hooker, with the bay, as you have been, we have removed
                                from them thus far, and yet they are not satisfied.&quot; Quoted

                                the right of arbitrary decisions by the magistrate: &quot;I must
                                confess, I ever looked at it as a way which leads directly to
                                tyranny, and so to confusion, and must plainly profess, if it was in
                                my liberty, I would choose neither to live nor leave my posterity
                                under such government.&quot; This letter exhibits
                                Hooker&apos;s intellect to great advantage. One is inclined to
                                rank him above most of his New England contemporaries in clearness
                                and breadth of thought.</p>

                                later. Hubbard thus describes what went on in every New England
                                settlement: &quot;Thus the first planters in every township,
                                having the advantage of the first discovery of places, removed
                                themselves into new dwellings, thereby making room for others to

                                professes to give a brief and orderly digest of the canons of

                        rend="sc">ASTER</hi>, Professor of American History in the University of
                    Pennsylvania, author of &quot;The History of the People of the United
                    Sates,&quot; etc. 8vo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>
                <p>&quot;The book is of great practical value, as many of the essays throw a
                    broad light over living questions of the day. Prof. McMaster has a clear, simple
                    style that is delightful. His facts are gathered with great care, and admirably
                    interwoven to impress the subject under discussion upon the mind of the
                        reader.&quot;<hi rend="i">Chicago Inter-Ocean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>&quot;Prof. McMaster&apos;s essays possess in their diversity a breadth
                    which covers most of the topics which are current as well as historical, and
                    each is so scholarly in treatment and profound in judgment that the importance
                    of their place in the library of political history can not be
                        gainsaid.&quot;<hi rend="i">Washington Times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>&quot;Such works as this serve to elucidate history and make more attractive
                    a study which an abstruse writer only makes perplexing. All through the studies
                    there is a note of intense patriotism and a conviction of the sound sense of the
                    American people which directs the government to a bright goal.&quot;<hi
                        rend="i">Chicago Record.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>&quot;A wide field is here covered, and is covered in Prof.
                    McMaster&apos;s own inimitable and fascinating style. . . . Can not but have
                    a marked value as a work of reference upon several most important
                        subjects.&quot;<hi rend="i">Boston Daily Advertiser.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>&quot;There is much that is interesting in this little book, and it is full
                    of solid chunks of political information.&quot;<hi rend="i">Buffalo

                </p>
                <p>&quot;Clear, penetrating, dispassionate, convincing. His language is what one
                    should expect from the Professor of American History in the University of
                    Pennsylvania. Prof. McMaster has proved before now that he can write history
                    with the breath of life in it, and the present volume is new proof.&quot;<hi
                        rend="i">Chicago Tribune.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>&quot;Of great practical value. . . . Charming and instructive

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>&quot;At once commends itself to the taste and judgment of all historical
                    readers. His style charms the general reader with its open and frank ways, its
                    courageous form of statement, its sparkling, crisp narrative and description,
                    and its close and penetrating analysis of character and events.&quot;<hi

                <head>THE STORY OF THE WEST SERIES.<lb/> Edited by Ripley Hitchcock.</head>
                <p>&quot;There is a vast extent of territory lying between the Missouri River
                    and the Pacific coast which has barely been skimmed over so far. That the
                    conditions of life therein are undergoing changes little short of marvelous will
                    be understood when one recalls the fact that the first white male child born in
                    Kansas is still living there; and Kansas is by no means one of the newer States.
                    Revolutionary indeed has been the upturning of the old condition of affairs, and
                    little remains thereof, and less will remain as each year goes by, until
                    presently there will be only tradition of the Sioux and Comanches, the cowboy
                    life, the wild horse, and the antelope. Histories, many of them, have been
                    written about the Western country alluded to, but most if not practically all by
                    outsiders who knew not personally that life of kaleidoscopic allurement. But ere
                    it shall have vanished forever we are likely to have truthful, complete, and
                    charming portrayals of it produced by men who actually knew the life and have
                    the power to describe it.&quot;<hi rend="i">Henry Edward Rood, in the Mail

                <p>&quot;In every way worthy of an author who, as an authority upon the Western
                    Indians, is second to none. A book full of color, abounding in observation, and
                    remarkable in sustained interest, it is at the same time characterized by a
                    grace of style which is rarely to be looked for in such a work, and which adds
                    not a little to the charm of it.&quot;<hi rend="i">London Daily

                <p>The figures of the prospector and the miner are clearly outlined in the course of
                    the romantic story of that mine which more than any other embodies the romance,

                    deep-mining, to the last of the stock gambling, the story is told in a way that
                    presents a singularly vivid and engrossing picture of a life which has played so

                <p>&quot;The field is comparatively new, and Mr. Maclay has brought to his task
                    patience, assiduity, and patriotism. . . . Maps and plans, and a great number of
                    illustrations, add value to the book, which is designed to be a permanent and
                    useful contribution to historical literature.&quot;<hi rend="i">New York

                <p>&quot;While the author has had the assistance of Lieut. Roy C. Smith, U. S.
                    N., in preparing those parts of his work which are necessarily technical, he has
                    wisely refrained from confusing the general reader by an undue parade of
                    technicalities. . . . The narrative proceeds in a clear, concise, and vigorous
                    style, which very materially adds to the character of the work.&quot;<hi

                </p>
                <p>&quot;The author writes as one who has digged deep before he began to write
                    at all. He thus appears as a master of his material. This book inspires
                    immediate confidence as well as interest.&quot;<hi rend="i">New York

                <p>&quot;A most conscientious narrative, from which wise statesmen may learn
                    much for their guidance, and it certainiy is one of absorbing

                <p>&quot;Mr. Maclay is specially qualified for the work he has undertaken. Nine
                    years has he devoted to the task. The result of his labors possesses not only
                    readableness but authority. . . . Mr. Maclay&apos;s story may be truthfully
                    characterized as a thrilling romance, which will interest every mind that is fed
                    by tales of heroism, and will be read with patriotic pride by every true

                <p>&quot;A more valuable and important work of history than this has not been
                    issued from the press for many a day. It is not only that this book tells a
                    story never before told (for Cooper&apos;s works never professed to tell the
                    whole story of our navy, even down to his own day), but that it is told with
                    true historic sense, and with the finest critical acumen.&quot;<hi rend="i"

                <p>&quot;No better excuse for this important work could be desired than that a

                    without a full and continuous record of its achievement. . . . The author has
                    important new facts to tell, and he tells them in a clear and graceful literary
                        style.&quot;<hi rend="i">Hartford Post.</hi>

                <p>&quot;Mr. Maclay has deservedly won for himself an enviable place among our
                    American historians. . . . His researches have been exhaustive and his inquiries
                    persistent, and he has used his wealth of material with a proper appreciation of
                    historical value.&quot;<hi rend="i">Boston Advertiser.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>&quot;Like the average young American, this author has an enthusiastic
                    appreciation of American valor on the high seas, and he reproduces graphic
                    sketches of battle scenes and incidents in a way to insure for his book a hearty
                    welcome on the part of those who keenly enjoy this sort of literature. . . . The
                    illustrations of the old battle ships and the conflicts at sea, made memorable
                    as long as the history of the American Republic shall live, add much to the
                    attractiveness of this book. . . . Professor Maclay has added a substantial work
                    to historical American literature.&quot;<hi rend="i">Philadelphia

                <p>&quot;It fills a place which has almost escaped the attention of historians.
                    Mr. Maclay&apos;s work shows on every page the minute care with which he
                    worked up his theme. His style is precise and clear, and without any pretense of
                    rhetorical embellishment.&quot;<hi rend="i">New York Tribune.</hi>

                <p>Every subject in this comprehensive work is timely, because it is of immediate
                    interest to every American. Special attention, however, may be called to the
                    account of &quot;American Productive Industry,&quot; by the Hon. Edward
                    Atkinson, with its array of immensely informing diagrams and tables; and also to
                    &quot;Industry and Finance,&quot; a succinct and logical presentation of
                    the subject by Professor F. W. Taussig. of Harvard University. Both these
                    eminent authorities deal with questions which are uppermost to day.</p>
