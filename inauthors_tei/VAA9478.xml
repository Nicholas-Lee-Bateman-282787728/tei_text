							<l>I have o'erheard, but I am dead within,</l>

							<l>O Marah! I would come and take your hand,</l>
							<l>But I would spare your eyes and touch the pain;</l>
							<l>I was not made for daytime, but the night,</l>
							<l>And have no heart to look upon myself.</l>
							<l>My mother oft did tell me long ago</l>
							<l>That I a suckling babe did pain her breast;</l>
							<l>And while I pressed for drink, her eyes she closed.</l>
							<l>In childhood human playmates had I none.</l>
							<l>The dogs were kinder, for I stroked their fur;</l>
							<l>And all my early love I gave to them,</l>
							<l>For they alone were pleased to be by me.</l>
							<l>And as the world its back upon me turned,</l>
							<l>Not harder but more tender grew my heart.</l>
							<l>I dared not go about in time of day,</l>
							<l>Lest by some jeer my soul be made to bleed.</l>

							<pb n="24" id="VAA9478-023"/>

							<l>The night had all affection for my youth;</l>
							<l>I lay upon its bosom like a child,</l>
							<l>And loved the candled starlight of the sky.</l>
							<l>I trod the silver of the milky ways,</l>
							<l>As one would journey in his native land;</l>
							<l>And worshiped as an ardent neophyte</l>
							<l>Bows low in prayer before his soul's own god.</l>
							<l>Each star did speak to me in silent speech</l>
							<l>The language of the cities made of gold.</l>
							<l>The soft night wind did fill my listening ears</l>
							<l>With music strange from out some distant world;</l>
							<l>And all the sorrow of the ages past</l>
							<l>Was sweet to me, for I was made of sorrow.</l>
							<l>The mighty pillars deep within my soul</l>
							<l>Were laid there by my sorrow, calm and strong;</l>
							<l>And I had learned of sorrow how to love,</l>
							<l>And sorrow drove me forth into the night</l>
							<l>Where I might freely look upon the world.</l>
							<l>And often in the night I walked abroad,</l>
							<l>And spoke with men who could not see my face.</l>
							<l>And women at the nightly festivals</l>
							<l>Oft wandered from the crowd to quiet lanes;</l>
							<l>And there, enshrouded by the kindly dark,</l>
							<l>My boyish lips did speak with them.</l>
							<l>And once Corona came. With her alone</l>
							<l>I dared to walk beneath the sun and moon.</l>
							<l>And then we both did meet again, again,</l>
							<l>Until none dared to part us, for like mine</l>
							<l>Her life was bound forever in this love.</l>
							<l>At first when I did speak of lacking grace</l>
							<l>Of feature, I was bidden to be silent;</l>
							<l>She said I was but weary and disheartened,</l>
							<l>Denying me the right to judge myself.</l>

							<l>When oft again I spoke, she would not hear,</l>

							<l>It seemed as if the gods did guide our course.</l>
							<l>Together grew the fiber of our lives,</l>
							<l>Ere I could think what had befallen us.</l>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">I</hi>'ll give my answer now, dear; it is "yes."</l>
							<l>More gently or you'll hurt me--yet 'tis bliss--</l>
							<l>Now but once more, and--and once more--'tis bliss!</l>
							<l>Wait, dear; let us sit still a while and talk,</l>
							<l>You in that chair and I in this one here,</l>
							<l>A little while, not long, I'm sure you will.</l>
							<l>I wish to tell you something--now, to-night,</l>
							<l>Before we go too far in this new way.</l>
							<l>You do not start; that shows your faith in me:</l>
							<l>It is about my future, not my past,</l>
							<l>You know I have not lived much in my life;</l>
							<l>But I have thought and seen the lives of others,</l>
							<l>Of women who have gone with men in marriage.</l>
							<l>Don't be impatient, dear, I'll not be long;</l>
							<l>I know you think it is some idle tale</l>
							<l>By which I hope to make you laugh--but no.</l>
							<l>And please--a little while; I cannot think,</l>
							<l>I only dream, when you have hold my hand.</l>
							<l>So--that is better, you off there, I here--</l>
							<l>A little while.</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">I have but one regret,</l>
							<l>I wish I came to you as free as air.</l>
							<l>A few of us can come to men that way,</l>
							<l>By fortune favored with inheritance,</l>
							<l>Or by some genius, got I know not how.</l>
							<l>But most of us come sadly empty handed.</l>
							<l>The world will not let us come otherwise,</l>
							<l>And we are still dependent creatures all.</l>
							<l>I wish you did not have to buy me, dear.</l>
							<l>I am so much degraded by the sale</l>
							<l>That were you some one else I should not sell,</l>
						</lg>

						<pb n="36" id="VAA9478-035"/>

						<lg>
							<l>O that I were as free to choose as you,</l>
							<l>And yet I'm sure I should choose only you.</l>
							<l>When once I go from here to be with you,</l>
							<l>I'll be a heavy weight upon your back.</l>
							<l>Alone you might have freely gone your way,</l>
							<l>No common slave of endless dreary toil;</l>
							<l>But now you bind yourself upon the rocks</l>
							<l>For me and little children born of us.</l>
							<l>And should you fail of cunning at your task,</l>
							<l>And fail to work and lie and bind men down</l>
							<l>To serve your aim for gold, then all is done</l>
							<l>With you; then must you sweat until you die.</l>
							<l>Because of me you'll grind and sweat the more;</l>
							<l>And unborn babes will cry into your ears</l>
							<l>With voices real that whip your tired life</l>
							<l>To longer hours. And your sad drudgery</l>
							<l>I cannot help; 'twill pierce me to the soul.</l>
							<l>And though I suffer, too, and daily toil,</l>
							<l>Eternal servant of a child's caprice,</l>
							<l>I still shall be a weight upon your back.</l>

						</lg>

						<lg>

							<l>Ah! now your heart is filled with noble things,</l>
							<l>Love, music, and the sky. You walk on clouds,</l>
							<l>The world is as a garden set with jewels,</l>
							<l>And softly sweetened as a room perfumed.</l>
							<l>For you all this shall change as I have said,</l>
							<l>I hear you groan beneath your heavy load,</l>
							<l>I feel no more your tender, sweet young soul,</l>
							<l>I see your head bound down upon your task,</l>
							<l>Lest some one steal your task and take our bread.</l>
							<l>At this great cost you pay for me, and I--</l>
							<l>I should deny you nothing at this price.</l>
							<l>And through the ages women somehow know,</l>
						</lg>


						<pb n="37" id="VAA9478-036"/>

						<lg>

							<l>By history taught, that they must yield themselves.</l>
							<l>This is the thing they give for the price men pay,</l>
							<l>Although it often be a gift of shame.</l>
							<l>And I have known some in this commerce long,</l>
							<l>Returning every piece of gold they cost</l>
							<l>With outraged inches of their tender flesh.</l>
							<l>Dear heart, with us let it be otherwise;</l>
							<l>And though you pay for me this bitter price,</l>
							<l>Still let us both be owners of ourselves,</l>
							<l>And never touch save out of love.--Kiss me.</l>

							<l><hi rend="b">I</hi> KNOW my heart and yet I answer not,</l>
							<l>For some I've seen grow sad by deep regret.</l>
							<l>Better than love that fails is solitude,</l>
							<l>Barren and hungry-hearted to the last.</l>
							<l>It has still the happiness of day dreams,</l>
							<l>For love that fails awakes the sleeper quick</l>
							<l>With ruthless hands of saddened memory.</l>
							<l>Better is solitude that still is sweet</l>
							<l>In thought and not unkindly looked upon,</l>
							<l>Whose virgin cheeks remember not love's kiss</l>
							<l>At break of dawn nor in night's deepest sleep,</l>
							<l>Whose breast is strange to touch of children's lips.</l>
							<l>Far better not to know love's throbbing joy,</l>
							<l>Than sadly to remember love is dead,</l>
							<l>And hear cold words that once were soft and sweet,</l>
							<l>And feel no more the press of eager arms</l>
							<l>Where oft thy head did lie in bliss at eve,</l>
							<l>And deign to beg where once thou didst permit.</l>
							<l>Give me stern love that's fierce in jealousy,</l>

						</lg>


						<pb n="38" id="VAA9478-037"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Ardent, like love that's born by open fields</l>
							<l>In silence save the soft winds whispering,</l>
							<l>And grows each starry night by garden stile,</l>
							<l>And lingers late before the last farewell;</l>
							<l>So strange and wondrous sweet it would not part</l>
							<l>But for the swiftly moving pallid stars</l>
							<l>That call ere long the noiseless break of dawn;</l>
							<l>Love that does not forget the first sweet kiss,</l>
							<l>The gentle, hesitating touch of hand,</l>
							<l>That blissful calm that made us one at first</l>
							<l>By cheerful glow of winter evening fire;</l>
							<l>Such love that stronger grows through changing years,</l>
							<l>When age shall steal the rose from off my cheek</l>
							<l>And dim my eyes and bend me slowly down.</l>
							<l>And in that distant time wilt thou forget</l>
							<l>The ancient trees 'neath which we sat at dusk,</l>
							<l>And how, like twilight's spreading dark, our souls</l>
							<l>Went forth with night's still music o'er the world,</l>
							<l>And we both dwelt again in olden times</l>
							<l>By glistening shores of sun-kissed golden seas,</l>
							<l>And heard the echoed songs of all the world</l>
							<l>Resound as softer grew the thickening dark?</l>
							<l>Love's music old, wilt thou then break the reed</l>
							<l>In twain by cruel neglect of thy warm lips?</l>
							<l>Or wilt thou find the music sweeter still,</l>
							<l>Like early childhood's oft-repeated songs?</l>
							<l>Though I pale before thee on life's long way,</l>
							<l>Wilt thou then still find joy in all my smiles?</l>
							<l>And sit with gladness by my side at eve?</l>
							<l>And walk with me through memory's olden lanes,</l>
							<l>To mark again the hallowed spots where first</l>
							<l>Thou kissed my cheek and shyly spoke my name--</l>
							<l>Where once with saddened hearts we quarreled a while,</l>
						</lg>

						<pb n="39" id="VAA9478-038"/>

						<lg>

							<l>And thou with moistened eyes besought my love,</l>
							<l>Which was again thine own ere thou didst ask--</l>
							<l>And where in shade of yonder sighing woods</l>
							<l>Oft tranced I sat and listened to thy hopes,</l>
							<l>And silently implored a part in all</l>
							<l>Close by thy side through joyous coming years?</l>
							<l>When once I give thee all wilt thou forget,</l>
							<l>In stress of other things, to kiss the lips</l>
							<l>That yearn for thee by lonely evening light?</l>
							<l>Then wilt thou whisper in my ear as now,</l>
							<l>And set astir the chords of love's sweet dream,</l>
							<l>And say the things that draw me close to thee</l>
							<l>Ere slumber close our eyes in still of night?</l>
							<l>I hear again thy oft repeated vows.</l>
							<l>Would thou wert nigh to still my wavering thoughts,</l>
							<l>And speak once more the words that are my bliss--</l>
							<l>That feed my heart which thou hast hunger taught.</l>

							<l>And yet, O God! I cannot, cannot guess</l>
							<l>Why lonely I must dwell and ever doubt</l>
							<l>The time will come when he, my own, will rout</l>
							<l>My fears and all my restless heart's distress.</l>
							<l>Why didst thou plant in me this longing so</l>
							<l>That in my wake and sleep forever calls</l>
							<l>And yet beyond my pale of fortune falls?</l>
							<l>Not always I'll be young, the bloom will go.</l>

						<head rend="center">THE ONE MAN</head>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE written law and the custom had denied me love. But as with
								other women, instinct had taught me to be silent. I was in the flower of my youth,
								and each day I hungered more and more.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Still, when I uttered a sound, the elders raised their fingers, and shamed me to
								silence, saying that love was only according to the written law and the custom.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Thus a year passed, and several years passed, and the flower of my youth began to
								fade, and the eternal hunger in my heart made me sick of soul, and joy was no more
								in me.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then one night I lifted my eyes again to the god of my childhood, and again
								earnestly I sought an answer in the stars; when lot I saw that the written law and
								the custom were man-made, and that the hunger in my heart and the flower of my youth
								were God-made.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And I trod forth in the middle of the night to yield myself to the arms that would
								hold me fast, and to the lips that would moisten mine. And my heart beat as never
								before, and the stars sang, and the night and the god of the night smiled upon
								me.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb n="42" id="VAA9478-041"/>

						<lg>
							<l>And when I came to the arms that would hold me fast and the lips that would moisten
								mine to give myself up, I said, "Here, pluck the flower of my youth, and feed my
								heart."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But the arms of him I loved were listless and would entwine me not, nor would his
								lips press mine; and there was some talk, and I cried aloud bitterly, understanding
								not. Then said he I loved, "The written law and the custom would crucify you on the
								street before all the people."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I went away, and walked in the dim night, wondering why the people should deny the
								will of God, and punish them that obey His command, for the love in me was
								heaven-born.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And soon thereafter I returned to him I loved, and said, "I will endure the
								punishment of the written law and the custom, touch me, touch me, touch me with your
								hand! and I will proclaim my joy aloud; for what is wrought in love's name is
								justified of God."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Then," said he, "must you perish, for they that need the written law and the
								custom will not hold them guiltless that need it not."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Death be welcome," I cried, "better a thousand times to live an hour and love and
								die at once, in the night, or be stoned upon the street, than die by inches, to
								wither and rot, and grow into old age as some unwatered flowerless vine, creeping
								over the juiceless earth, ugly to behold and barren."</l>
						</lg>

						<pb n="43" id="VAA9478-042"/>

						<lg>
							<l>"Wait," palliated my love, "perhaps all shall be fulfilled even yet according to
								the written law and the custom. Wait "</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Waited have I all these years. The fruit is ripe, the time is here, it is the
								season. See, I am still beautiful, the rose still lights my cheek, my eyes not yet
								are dim, my bosom breathes like wind-swept fields of grain, and I nightly dream the
								dream of women loved!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then he said, "The written law and the custom are for the good of all the people,
								and the good of all the people is the will of God. Wait!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"No," I cried, "I will have my hand touched by you whom I love. I will walk with
								you in the evening and in the night unafraid, and I will not part from you; the dawn
								shall be a knell for twain in your house, and the dusk shall not divide us."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Wait!" said he again.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I will tear down the walls that surround me, break the locks that imprison me,
								pull back the veil that blinds me. A mountain of laws shall not deny me, nor a sea
								of ice freeze my desire. I was made to breathe the sweet, and though death steal
								upon me at dusk, this day shall I follow the voice of the stars and the god of the
								stars."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Softly he said, "Too much I love you;" and touching me with his hand, he led me to
								where the day was darkening; and long we sat and spake no word, for the tumult was
								not of human speech; and soon the night <pb n="44" id="VAA9478-043"/> came, and the
								stars crept through the dark; yet spake he no word, nor touched me again with his
								hand.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And after a long time, in perfect calm, he whispered, "We will obey the law;" and
								arising, we wandered slowly off together, out into the light and the world.</l>

							<l>And worn by days of anxious servitude,</l>
							<l>Shall fall so deep into the gaping pit</l>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">I</hi> THOUGHT of our wedding, a long time ago,</l>
							<l>The noise that it made and the grand public show.</l>
							<l>You said I was charmingly beautiful, dear--</l>
							<l>You're thinking it still? That sounds good to the ear</l>
							<l>Of even a wife who is losing no sleep</l>
							<l>Concerning the love that she never could keep.</l>
							<l>I knew you were rich, but you're much richer now.</l>
							<l>How mad we both were on our hearing of how</l>

							<pb n="51" id="VAA9478-050"/>

							<l>The friend of our bosom depicted us two</l>
							<l>As animal things with ideas so few!</l>
							<l>When once you've extracted his joy-giving juice--</l>
							<l>A friend--what's a friend but a thing for abuse?</l>
							<l>If life never taught us another dread thing,</l>
							<l>It taught us that lesson with many a sting.</l>
							<l>It seems long ago that we lived through that day.</l>
							<l>I'm weary again and without much delay</l>
							<l>Should leave you at once for a journey quite far--</l>
							<l>You say you'd be glad if I went to a star?</l>
							<l>It's pitiful how we both sit here and stare,</l>
							<l>All wilted inside in this stifling air.</l>
							<l>Each time I came back from my journeying, then</l>
							<l>We lighted the candle of pleasure again.</l>
							<l>It burned and it burned and it much smaller grew,</l>
							<l>And every time it went out for us two.</l>
							<l>I'm fearing to go and return through that door,</l>
							<l>The candle is spent and will burn nevermore.</l>
							<l>And you've gone away several times in the past,</l>
							<l>And when you returned did the thing ever last?</l>
							<l>How clever we've been in our conduct--and why?</l>
							<l>You're never annoyed with a wee baby's cry,</l>
							<l>You're never annoyed with a few weeks of scare</l>
							<l>That I shall be bringing a boisterous heir.</l>
							<l>How cunning I am! You should like me for that,</l>
							<l>I've never been careless and ugly and fat.</l>
							<l>You show me with pride, and I oft play the part</l>
							<l>A woman who's clever can play well by heart.</l>
							<l>But that is outside; it is different here.</l>
							<l>You've always been good; I don't loathe you, my dear.</l>
							<l>I thought of the words that the minister used</l>
							<l>That night when he called and so much us amused;</l>
							<l>And yet of his cant I've been thinking a lot.</l>

							<pb n="52" id="VAA9478-051"/>

							<l>I laughed at the time, but I've not quite forgot.</l>
							<l>His words ran like this, I've been saying them o'er,</l>
							<l>"In things of the flesh you should barter no more;</l>
							<l>Not even by law is such barter made right:</l>
							<l>I fear you are bodies, not souls, in God's sight."</l>
							<l>That sounds, does it not, as if we were both lost?</l>
							<l>You never complained of the price that I cost.</l>
							<l>I've paid in return--have I not, my dear sir?--</l>
							<l>I'm going to bed; but now please don't infer</l>
							<l>I hate you a bit, for I don't. Like a ball</l>
							<l>Our lives keep on rolling and rolling, that's all.</l>

							<l>I swear the sins of youthful women lay upon my hands, the grimy sweat of wearied

							<l>Who'd clothed my body with garments fair, and the agonies of children, too,
								condemned to toil that I might freely live.</l>
							<l>I swear the cries of beaten slaves turned not my ear, nor wails of stunted children
								that the sea of want doth give.</l>
							<l>There was no order in my days. I slept and ate as instinct called, and heeded every
								wanton passion near,</l>
							<l>A face, a form, a game of chance, the gossip of the idle wags, and lived to finish
								quickly earth's career.</l>

							<pb n="55" id="VAA9478-054"/>

							<l>And though I shall regret what now I here confess, and cringing turn from this
								swift lash that o'er my back I send--</l>
							<l>I swear that thing called soul had not set torch within the bloodstained walls
								where creaked my heart, bent on low passion's end.</l>
							<l>How could I help but love you, coming like a balmy light into the dead and moonless
								night of empty years?</l>
							<l>You spoke, and I saw the blood of murdered innocence glare red upon my hands, and
								heard the wailing sea of tears.</l>
							<l>You touched my hand, and through my restless life stole scenes of quiet woods and
								dancing shafts of gold upon the green;</l>
							<l>And daffodils and running vines, and larks' and linnets' songs, and the softly
								sounding lyre of doves perched high unseen.</l>
							<l>Things I had dreamed of in my dreaming childhood came again, and solitude with you
								was what I longed for most;</l>
							<l>Out of other distant worlds remembered visions sprang that long ere earthly birth I
								knew 'mid God's immortal host.</l>
							<l>And when I kissed your lips this world was born again, and in the still and starry
								night I was with you and God;</l>
							<l>And truth and mercy bloomed within my soul, and kindly words bred fast upon my
								lips, and bliss came where I trod.</l>
							<l>And long I lay upon the grassy earth, your hand in mine, and listened to your voice
								that showed the better way;</l>

							<pb n="56" id="VAA9478-055"/>

							<l>And your own God I learned to love, but loved you more o'er all I ever knew, you
								who were fated not to stay.</l>
							<l>If I am aught, and tired men and weary women know my voice, and smile amid their
								tears, it is for you;</l>
							<l>And if a song has left my lips, some clear and simple song that comfort brings
								within some lonely heart of rue,</l>
							<l>It is not mine, but comes from out the mellow shaded woods of memory now mouldering
								in the faded past;</l>
							<l>And if the springtide and the autumn bring reborn the songs of love, it is because
								your spirit holds me fast--</l>
							<l>Because I pressed my lips to yours in the secret, voiceless woods, where daffodils
								and running vines forever blow;</l>
							<l>And where in tender dreams of waking hours, through all the silent years, my
								vagrant footsteps often come and go.</l>

						<head rend="center">THE AWAKENING</head>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">F</hi>ROM every village and city and house of the fields, I saw arise
								a vapor, like the star-dust of the night. And each trembling shaft murmured like
								running water as it climbed out of the dark world. All else was unchanged; it was
								the world I had known from childhood.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I also was lifted out of the dark world, and I felt that I was being carried
								through space, as I had sometimes felt in dreams. High up the sounds of the rising
								vapor blended, and I heard the symphony of universal love shifting over the cities
								of the earth.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The music swayed backward and forward and filled the spaces of the sky in diverse
								running streams, like the currents of the sea. Half asleep I lay on the breathing
								breast of the music rising, ever rising out of the troubled world below.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The pyramids may have crumbled ere I awoke, and rivers have been born on the
								bleached earth of dead continents. It was no oblivious sleep, but one that feels
								itself ever awakening, like the gentle sleep aroused by music in the dawn, or the
								soft sleep of love that feels the warmth of lips in the twilight.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>When I awoke, I saw that the vapor had descended, and that the symphony of
								universal love filled all the cities of the earth. And I saw a strange race of
								people--strange with beauty. In the streets men went arm in arm. And there was no
								haste, and the world was like a garden fanned by perfumed breezes, and the places
								where men worked were adorned like the palaces of <pb n="60" id="VAA9478-059"/> old
								times, and there was no sorrow anywhere, and no haste there was, only sweet exchange
								of service, and none cringed, but all walked erect, looking kindly upon one another.
								But stranger than all else, I saw no sorrow.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I asked, "What year is it?" and I was told. And one said to me, "Thy face is
								strangely marked." And looking into a glass, I saw that my face had still the lines
								of sorrow that life had graven there ere I slept, and this I told. But none that
								stood round me remembered sorrow, save an old man who had had an ancient book in his
								youth wherein was written of sorrow.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And I saw that the history of the sorrow of the world had faded and was a thing
								buried in olden times, and I understood then that I had been long asleep. But now
								the snow of death was melted by love, and as a drowsy swimmer on a sun-kissed beach,
								I warmed myself, touching this one by the hand, and that one on the lips, to assure
								myself that I moved not among the visions of my brain, and that the hands and lips
								were warm.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But it was the earth-the earth of old times! save that the promise of the human
								heart had been fulfilled. I sank down and prayed, and I should have wept and
								moistened the ground, but I could not, for tears had faded forever from the
								earth.</l>

								voice of the stars in the night--though unforgettable--was still incomplete without

						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>In meditation I trod the snow-stained mountains, where the air is chill, unwarmed

								valley died away, and the songs of love with ered on my lips.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I do not counsel you, O solitary! to shun eternally the mountain, and the purer

							<l>I do not counsel you to quench the beacon on the hilltop of your timeless self, or

						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Though some understand you not, others will kiss your lips to smiles, and sit with

								light that is within you shall be like that of a wedding house.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And you, O solitary, shall touch your kin with the naked hand, and blend with the

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">O</hi>NCE I lived on a high mountain, dead to the distant world of
								men, dead to possession of any thing, dead to myself of flesh. The quiet sun
								attending me by day, made of earth a dome of beaten gold, I wandering always on the
								top, and looking downward on the world. By night the moon walked with me, my brother
								of the sky, saying things <pb n="74" id="VAA9478-073"/> in a voiceless voice, which
								I understood. The stars knew me in the night and smiled, children of the house of
								God playing on the mead of heaven, calling often to each other. Not once saw I God
								face to face, yet heard Him when I stopped my ears, whispering as does the sea on
								the bosom of the night. I feared to close my eyes, banishing the world, and call Him
								to show His face, lest I should die. Yet always by day and night I saw His children
								of the mead looking down on me, I looking downward on the world. Speaking with no
								one, human speech I nigh forgot--the sighing seas of God breathing in my breast. All
								the music of forgotten worlds echoed in my brain; and the unborn children sang, and
								the dead children sang. But naught could I see save the dome of beaten gold, and the
								playing babes of the sky, and the sun and the moon. And none would come to touch me,
								and take me by the human hand, and press me tight in arms that held the warmth of
								earth as I. I saw naught but eternal things, heard naught but eternal speech; I
								alone was ephemeral amid these timeless beings. The purity of the mountain top froze
								the crimson rivers of my flesh; and since I was to die, I longed for mortal kin. The
								kindly human voice, with the sin of the crowded world, and duty, and toil, and
								laughter--all called for me to come; and rushing down from the mountain top, I
								sought again the world of women and men, the warm water of human things touching me
								on every side. In lane and mart I walked with men; drank from the cup of love till I
								was subdued with joy, yielding child-like to the manner of the world. Now the
								mountain top is far away; but the love of dying things is mine, for out of death our
								love is made; and I am with my kin.</l>

						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>O that I had the art to put emotion into words, and make the pages of my book a
								living thing!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Impatient I grow at the lethargy of words. I would beat them, prick them with
								spears, whip them with iron whips, to make them cry out the passion of my soul!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I would let out all the penned-up tumult that tortures me within.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I would deliver the world from the gods of stone and the gods of gold; I would

								open the doors and uncivilize mankind.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I would counsel that most things called learning be unlearned, and that most
								traditions be forgotten. I would proclaim the new wisdom--older than the old--which
								in the process of civilizing ourselves we have forgotten.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Ten thousand years before great cities stood on this continent, brown men sat
								peacefully together with women and children, and looked at the stars at night and
								wondered at the beauty and mystery of trees, and sang love songs to the great God,
								and believed!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I would abolish the universal mad-house called large cities, turning the giddy
								inmates into green fields by running waters, teaching them lessons in stillness and
								placidity.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Nature's laws would I make the rules of virtue. Perversion and unkindness only
								would I call sin.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>O that I could sing a song that would soften the heart of the world, that brother
								would not stand armed against brother, and sister against sister!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>For I myself am weary of battle, and the tenderness I stifle in me may not come to
								life again.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I would have all men rich in spirit and comfortable in body, for I despise
								poverty.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I would make love free among men and women, without barter in houses and lands,
								that no man should <pb n="91" id="VAA9478-090"/> buy what he could not win, and no
								woman should sell herself--one man for one woman, distinguishing love from lust. It
								is the same whether a woman sell herself in or out of the law; or whether a man buy
								a woman in or out of the law.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I would awaken the sleepers to the glory of the world, the harps that play in every
								wind-swept forest, the living colors of every nightfall's western sky, the sapphire
								dome of the days of summer, and the still stars creeping through the ebony of
								night.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Never in the wild witchery of dream have I seen a world comparable in beauty to
								this:</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The red gold of the west at twilight often with beauty pains my heart, speaking a
								language like the lure of far-reaching sea waves, or the call of sweet-singing birds
								at dawn on inland meads.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>What more revelation does the world demand? Here is revelation upon revelation!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>The book of day and the book of night burst with wonder, testifying that there is
								more in the world than we, and that we shall yet be other than we are.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>O that I could sing a song that would soften the heart of the world!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But I cannot; and my wild cries are a picture that is faded, a harp with loosened
								chords, a reed that is broken. The fires of my soul turn to ashes upon the page.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>And the longer I listened the more I wondered why the people did not silence

							<l>And I remembered how dearly liberty had been bought from the self-righteous masters

						<lg>
							<l>And there in the whispering wood, where every leaf was a tongue softly humming the

								within, prayed that I might at least once in my life boldly strike the iron
								harpstrings of the heroic.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And soon darkness came on, and the lights of the city looked out into the night;
								and on my way back, as I went by the magnificent church, it was silent and dark; yet
								I somehow fancied that I could still hear the minister telling the people about
								Christ.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And as I turned away from the great stone arches of the magnificent church, now
								sullenly grand in the mystic glimmer of the night, I remembered that the Son of Man

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">T</hi>HIS beautiful world, set in a heaven of wonders, abounding in
								the gifts of nature, modeled in the great fancy of some spendthrift god of
								beauty--this beautiful world! why is it the theatre of man's cruelty?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I looked at the sun this evening as he sank behind the earth, and I wondered if all
								this bewildering beauty was but to mock the little soul of man; and as I looked
								again and again, I felt a great tenderness steal upon me like the tenderness of one
								who loves; and as the darkness succeeded the glaring red of the west, the cares of
								the world fled from me and sank with the departed sun over the edge of the
								world.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Yet I fear this tenderness that the twilight wrought in me, for to-morrow in the
								fierce fight for life it may be the weak place in my armor--and I am condemned to
								fight upon the street.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Yet not for myself I cry aloud, for I am one who sometimes sits at the feast. But I
								sit there only in body while my soul refuses to come, awaiting my return by the
								quiet of the midnight lamp, there to chide me gently for the wasted hours.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But I cry aloud for them in the dark corners of the earth. Great God, are we less
								than the animals, that the powerful among us should gather and store for days that
								never come--more than the need of a life of a thousand years? What brute maims and
								kills his kind for purposes like these?</l>
						</lg>

						<pb n="102" id="VAA9478-101"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Thou maker of worlds, soften this our life ere we perish. In the clatter of trade
								thy name is not heard, and thy candle is spent in the darkness of selfish gain. The
								fires of love are cold, and greed is master of the world. Long have I prayed that
								thou soften the heart of greed. Now I cry aloud that murdered justice rise like an
								ugly vision at a feast.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Great God, is it Thy will that the enemies of society shall prosper, and the
								virtuous and the useful be damned to slavery and want?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Great God, art Thou dead? Or living, is Thy hand palsied--Thou whom we thought so
								powerful--Thou maker of worlds? Is justice harder to make than a world? I shall
								remember my question, and Thou wilt answer me at the gate of Paradise.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Or if, after all, this life should be the end, who will requite the toilers in the
								dark corners of the earth? The faith that Thou wilt yet do justice stays the
								knife.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>My brother, I think of you toiling in the dark corners. How sweet to you must often
								seem the peace in the gloom of the grave. For in the grave there is no weariness and
								hard words have lost their sting.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Great God, if Thou hearest our cry, turn not away from us, we are Thy children. The
								journey is strange and we have lost our way. Some perish in pitfalls, and some of
								gentle spirit await the call of death. Again, again--oh, soften the heart of greed,
								and before the rulers of men let rise the pale faces in the dark corners of
								want!</l>

							<l><hi rend="b">T</hi>HERE was a fool once, and to every one that passed him he said,
								"Look!" pointing with his finger. But no one saw anything. Yet he continued to point
								ever more and more urgently.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And after a while a few persons thought he must surely see something, and they

						<lg>
							<l>But most of the people shook their heads and smiled, and after a while no one

								year, until he died. And when he was dead, the people in jest made a mound of earth
								over his grave, to commemorate the fool.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And year after year the tradition of the fool went from father to son until a few
								generations had passed, when behold! one day a youth stood where the fool had stood,
								and he looked as his father laughingly pointed as the fool had done;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And the youth cried out, "O father, see!" and the father's face grew solemn, for he
								likewise saw or thought he saw, and he called to others, and the laughter was
								hushed, and each beholder called his friends and his kin, and each shuddered as he
								looked.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And through the city of content there ran a shudder like that which ran through
								each beholder. But it was too late; and ere long rivers of crimson flowed through
								the streets, and at noonday it was dark like a starless <pb n="104" id="VAA9478-103"

								kissed some one on the lips.</l>

							<l>When all the dancing day's bright beams of sun had gone to flight,</l>
							<l>And through the pulseless falling dark a luring wind sang low</l>
							<l>The music that the stars march to so silently and slow?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Hast never sat and thought of one, 'mid sad old memory's tears,--</l>
							<l>One who had lived within your heart through all the joyous years?</l>
							<l>'Tis sweet this sadness that comes on when night begins to fall,</l>
							<l>And spreads its silent softening dark through chamber doors and hall.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>It is the only heritage that time has left me now;</l>
							<l>And on its steady course it keeps my vessel's shattered prow.</l>
							<l>And thus in corners of each life you'll find some hidden face</l>
							<l>That through the years keeps marching on and holds each soul in place.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>So let the night grow thicker still and breezes turn to storm,</l>
							<l>There's armored safe within my heart and free from earthly harm</l>
							<l>This smiling face of one who looks into my eyes e'en now,</l>
							<l>While through the world I go alone till snow lies on my brow.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>And playful was the sea as a tigress with her cub; but he had known the teeth of

						<lg>
							<l>And as the gentle rocking changed to moving hills and valleys, and as the salt
								spray washed his face, and the lisp and swish of the sea turned to groans, still
								kept he his eyes over the water.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And then, as if determined to embrace him, the monster angry grew; with frothy
								tendrils yearning up the sides of his boat; and the symphony of the sea broke loose
									<pb n="128" id="VAA9478-127"/> like the grating of the gates of hell; and a whir
								was in the wind; and a rain arose out of the sea; and he kept his eyes over the

						<lg>
							<l>And after many strokes he reached the shore; and he laughed at the sea, and laughed
								over his triumph, for the frothy tendrils still yearned up the rocks where he bound
								fast his boat.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And soon the whir went out of the wind, and the moving hills and valleys of the sea
								turned to still meadows, and peace lay over the water, and the sea waited.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then came forth another, a youth; and he lay in his bark that rocked nimbly with
								the rocking of the waves; and he rested and dreamed and, as the twilight turned to
								night, looked often at the stars, fashioning out of his desire a temple for the
								heart of man.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The gentle swells murmured, singing to rest his soul, and filling with music the

						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>At last the murmuring sea, singing to rest his soul, and filling with music the
								temple of his dream, took him to herself, caressing him tenderly, kissing his cheek
								and stroking softly his body; and the foam of the sea was in his hair, and a weed of
								the sea lay on his breast.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then the sea ceased to murmur and gurgle and lisp and lap; and the stillness lying
								over the water was as a prayer; and the people of the sea gathered round him, and
								the universe was still as it was before time, and the sea waited.</l>

						<head rend="center">THERE WAS A YOUNG ARTIST</head>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">T</hi>HERE was a young artist once, and his heart was filled with
								love, and truth was on his lips, and he sought to do men good.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He painted a picture called "The Love of the World"; but before he had finished, he
								sat often with hunger and went clad in the garments of want.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>At last the picture was finished, but there was no one to requite him either in
								love or gold.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>His friends knew he was only one of them, and they were sure he was not a great
								artist; and strangers knew not of him.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And soon want laid its hand upon him, and the love in his heart turned to hate, and
								the truth on his lips turned to lies;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>For the God he had worshipped and trusted and leaned upon was dead or had forsaken
								him;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And out of desperation he painted another picture, and also called it "The Love of
								the World," but in his heart he knew it was "The Hate of the World."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But the lie was caught up by the people, and strangers came, and he had food and
								wherewith to clothe himself, and years went on, and he'prospered.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Only a spark of the early artist lived in his heart; and often when he stood before
								the picture in the house of him who had bought it, he looked cautiously about, and
								if alone, drew himself up erect, and pronounced aloud the words, "The Hate of the
								World."</l>
						</lg>

						<pb n="130" id="VAA9478-129"/>

						<lg>
							<l>And once standing so, and pronouncing the words aloud, he was overheard by his
								friend who had purchased the picture.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And his friend besought him to speak the words no more, lest he be overheard, and
								the picture become valueless.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But ever thereafter the owner himself saw "The Hate of the World" when he stood
								before the picture; and once he likewise pronounced the words aloud as he stood
								before it.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And he likewise was overheard by a neighbor who chanced to be his guest; and so ere
								long all the people came to understand that the picture which they had loved was in
								fact "The Hate of the World."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And each in his time, as he stood before it, pronounced the fatal words; and the
								people sought out the artist, and demanded to know why he had deceived them.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then brought he forth his first picture, which was indeed "The Love of the World";
								and when he told the people, they laughed at him, and believed him not. And some
								were for bruising his flesh, and some for taking his life, and others said, "We will
								drive him from the city."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And they drove him from the city; and as he passed out the gate, and turned and
								looked over the buildings and the towers of the temples of justice and of God, he
								wept; for it was the city of his birth.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And they burned his first picture before his eyes. And the magistrates of the city
								assembled, and forbade that there be painted any other picture, or carven any
								statue, lest the people be defiled.</l>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">T</hi>HUS spoke he: If you expect perfection in this world, you are
								condemned. In my youth I saw the golden city of joy just before me--always just
								before me.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Oh, it was beautiful! It was winter and night was coming on, and a young woman was
								looking out of a door now and then. A bright fire sparkled and gave life to the
								room. A baby slept in a white bed; the evening meal was laid. There was a bird in a
								cage and a dog lying by the fire. I said the woman looked out now and then.
								Stillness, gentleness, light and warmth breathed through the scene in contrast with
								the dark and cold outside; and strange, this never, never changed: it was always
								winter and night was coming on, and always quiet and peaceful, warmth and light, and
								always a young woman looking out of the door now and then.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And every day I prayed inwardly that I might know the love of this vision; and in
								my credulous youth I trusted the great God, Him of the sky sown with stars and the
								sun and the moon.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But I never knew the room and the woman and the child and the cheering glow and the
								peace. I was always behind the carnival of silver and gold; and who would know love
								must be in the midst of the carnival, for it is the age of the carnival of silver
								and gold. And the vision remained the counterfeit coinage of my brain, a lure in the
								soul, as you poets say, something like music one thinks one hears in the night.</l>

								beautiful; but I have no desire, the fruit of my labor has ripened, but the leaves
								of the tree of passion are dead; the dream is spent, the heart hunger forgot, and I
								lie like a shell on the shore of time, awaiting a wave that shall wash me to
								sea.</l>

						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>You who daily browse in libraries and dusty bookshops--is it an explanation of the
								cosmic wheels you seek? I, too, with rapture have searched in libraries, touching
								this volume, scanning that, and pondering long over yet another.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Oh! with what a throbbing heart have I implored the pages to yield their wisdom to
								me! No speech can explain the unworldly joy that was in me, while I pursued the
								thoughts of one the world had dubbed an immortal seer.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb n="143" id="VAA9478-142"/>

							<l>And at last, having mastered the thought, I cried to the great God in thanks for my

								immortal truth?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>How I have walked in the sunlight with an air of superior knowledge, questioning

								he was no seer at all, to find that another held the secrets of God whispered from
								on high!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The second cry of ecstasy was less joyous, the third still less, the fourth still
								less, until at last there was no more ecstasy, distrust pricking me like a
								thorn.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But now I know the greater wisdom; for pursuing one night the last pages of the
								last metaphysician who would teach me what he knew not himself, I heard a child
								crying in the dark,</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And I sought out the child in the dark, and carried it on my shoulder to the love
								from which it had wandered. And on my return, I passed a house where there was
								laughter, and music, and dancing;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And farther on, under the light of a lamp, one called me by name, and took my hand,
								and pressed it in his own, and spoke kindly;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And as I returned to my metaphysician, in the dim of my study, I smiled; for I saw
								that the thing I sought was in me, and in the child, and in the dancers, and in him
								who took me by the hand.</l>

							<l><hi rend="b">"Y</hi>OU want to see some one?" the lady said,</l>
							<l>As an old, bent darky lifted up his head</l>
							<l>From out his hands; and rising from the door,</l>
							<l>Came slowly toward her, for she said no more,</l>
							<l>And stopped inside the gate to know his will.</l>
							<l>The spacious lawn and house within were still;</l>
							<l>For empty was the place, some weeks had passed,</l>
							<l>Or maybe months and weeks, since tenants last</l>
							<l>Had trod the rooms that now lay grim and bare.</l>
							<l>Upon the lawn were trees, palmetto, pear,</l>
							<l>And evergreen, and near the fence there stood</l>
							<l>An old magnolia tree of scented wood;</l>
							<l>Long years the burning Carolina sun</l>
							<l>Had met its leaves where boys now men had run.</l>
							<l>Deep cracked and old, four mighty pillars sent</l>
							<l>Their tops to meet an arched roof that bent</l>
							<l>And leaned. And yet some recent art not mean</l>
							<l>With color made the house look bright and clean.</l>
							<l>"You want to see some one?" the lady said,</l>
							<l>The silvery-haired old negro bowed his head,</l>
							<l>And coming near with salutations dumb,</l>
							<l>He finally replied, "Ah does, yes um."</l>

							<l>But lately come to guard the spiritual life</l>
							<l>That parish held far down the Congaree,</l>
							<l>In sunny Carolina, 'mid a sea</l>
							<l>Of white-capped cotton fields now fresh o'errun,</l>
							<l>Immaculate beneath the Southern sun.</l>
							<l>He might stay, the lady said, and do the chores,</l>
							<l>And mow the lawn, and mind the outer doors,</l>
							<l>And water flowers, and trim the trees, with all</l>
							<l>There'd be enough until each evening's fall.</l>
							<l>And so he stayed, this darky old, and said</l>
							<l>But little as the burning days turned red</l>
							<l>In evening's hour, and did his work all well</l>
							<l>And kindly, with a mind that did not dwell</l>
							<l>In hesitation on the longest task;</l>
							<l>Nor for a single half-day's rest did ask,</l>
							<l>As months went on in that hot Southern clime,</l>
							<l>Until again 'twas cotton picking time.</l>
							<l>And now the minister's good wife called him,</l>
							<l>As oft, while day at east was growing dim,</l>
							<l>And said, "To-morrow rake the leaves to burn,</l>
							<l>For now it is the cooler season's turn;</l>
							<l>And I think, too, the old magnolia tree</l>
							<l>You might cut down, and then you come to me;</l>
							<l>And there next spring we'll make a flower bed."</l>
							<l>He smiled and bowed, "Yes um, yes um," he said.</l>
							<l>He raked the lawn and raked and raked yet more,</l>
							<l>Until it looked like one vast velvet floor;</l>
							<l>But swung no ax into that dying tree,</l>
							<l>And sat beneath its limbs content and free</l>
							<l>Till evening late, still humming some old song,</l>

							<pb n="149" id="VAA9478-148"/>

							<l>And thus a week and days soon slipped along.</l>
							<l>The minister's good wife called him once more,</l>

							<l>She said, "You haven't cut that tree down yet--</l>
							<l>The old magnolia near the fence; don't let</l>
							<l>Me see it there this time to-morrow eve";</l>
							<l>And with these earnest words she turned to leave.</l>
							<l>"Please, Miss, de ole tree make a lot o' shade</l>
							<l>When de sun all day a-shinin' hot an' raid."</l>
							<l>"Oh--no, I think not much; fell it to-morrow."</l>
							<l>"Yes um," he said, as if his heart knew sorrow.</l>
							<l>To-morrows and to-morrows quickly came,</l>
							<l>The old magnolia tree still stood the same.</l>
							<l>Once it was an ax he lacked, and then</l>
							<l>His back was feeble, and he asked again</l>
							<l>A few days yet to do the task, and said,</l>
							<l>As before, "Yes um," and humbly bowed his head.</l>
							<l>And so the torrid Southern summer passed,</l>
							<l>And solemn, cooler evenings came at last;</l>
							<l>And now the good wife's o'ertaxed patience failed,</l>
							<l>And once again the old negro she hailed,</l>
							<l>And once again demanded--would he fell</l>
							<l>The tree, or would he then and there dare tell</l>
							<l>That this command he had no mind to heed,</l>
							<l>"It's but an old o'ergrown and dying weed,</l>
							<l>I'll have it cut; if you have not the will</l>
							<l>Or strength for it, there are some others still.</l>
							<l>I'll have it down--to-morrow--by this hour!"</l>
							<l>With these sharp words his form began to cower,</l>
							<l>And o'er his face now old with years of life</l>
							<l>There spread the signs of grieving, inward strife.</l>
							<l>"Well, well, and what reply have you?" she said;</l>

							<l>"You stop, white gem'man; Lawd, what you about!</l>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">L</hi>ET me do my work each day; and if the darkened hours of despair
								overcome me, may I not forget the strength that comforted me in the desolation of
								other times. May I still remember the bright hours that found me walking over the
								silent hills of my childhood, or dreaming on the margin of the quiet river, when a
								light glowed within me, and I promised my early God to have courage amid the
								tempests of the changing years. Spare me from bitterness and from the sharp passions
								of unguarded moments. May I not forget that poverty and riches are of the spirit.
								Though the world know me not, may my thoughts and actions be such as shall keep me
								friendly with myself. Lift my eyes from the earth, and let me not forget the uses of
								the stars. Forbid that I should judge others, lest I condemn myself. Let me not
								follow the clamor of the world, but walk calmly in my path. Give me a few friends
								who will love me for what I am; and keep ever burning before my vagrant steps the
								kindly light of hope. And though age and infirmity overtake me, and I come not
								within sight of the castle of my dreams, teach me still to be thankful for life, and
								for time's olden memories that are good and sweet; and may the evening's twilight
								find me gentle still.</l>

						<div4 type="part">

							<head rend="center">I</head>

							<lg>
								<l><hi rend="b">A</hi> LONG walk. Tired and contented. I have been dreaming again.
									My walk led me upon a hill to the southeast. When at the top, I turned to see some
										<pb n="176" id="VAA9478-175"/> cattle grazing on the wayside--and behold! my
									native city lay at my feet.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>How silent, how small, how secluded! Like a new toy in the grass, or a nest
									tucked away among the trees of the surrounding valley; or--save for the lines of
									smoke moving slowly to the north--like a picture hanging in a gallery.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>No one was near me, and only a few farmhouses stood in the distance. And I
									thought and dreamed of the wanderings of men amid the toy-town in the grass, of
									the desires and hopes that had come and passed in this nest among the trees.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>I thought of my own wanderings, and remembered some sleepless hours divine with
									the music of the night. A thousand memories filled me with the joys of other
									years--memories of friends changed and gone, and of the dawning sun lighting up
									the nimble fancy worlds of youth.</l>

							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>I thought I could see the place where two lovers met in the dim past, and out of
									the kiss of their lips I crawled into the morning of the world--and these poems
									after me.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>Though I did not hear their words, unforgotten is their lover's parley; for ere
									they knew me, it was I who moved their lips to speech in the still night.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>How much history has passed within this small space of earth-of no importance to
									the world; yet all important the life of each to himself!</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>How many have lived and toiled and planned here--how many, tired and care-worn,
									have lain down here to repose at night!</l>
							</lg>

							<pb n="177" id="VAA9478-176"/>

							<lg>

									immortal joy, as if death were not!</l>

								<l>O my native city! thou knowest not how often I have thought of thee when far'

									have passed by me, fondly have I thought of thee.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>The cool shade of thy many trees, and the memory of the gentle river at thy
									margin, have been a solace to me in strange and distant places.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>But thou wilt go on unconcerned as eve r when I am gone into the silent land.
									Soon wilt thou forget that I wandered about thy streets in the shadow of thy
									buildings. Within thy bosom I lay as a child, have grown to manhood, and shall at
									last rest in dreamless sleep.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>But thou, too, must pass away; and where now is trade and manufacture, God in His
									time will plant another forest; and it will grow, and no man will know that thou
									dwelt there.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>On new-born branches birds will whisper songs of love, and flowered children of
									the wilderness will drink the sun-wine, and gloaming eve shall know the wild

						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>You are marching through this archway--you who sit with me in the evening and think

								commerce of the flesh, whether in or out of the law; you ill-formed and unloved
								person; you, disappointed one, making a sorry figure on the streets of life; you who

								you who think yourself learned; and you who know yourself to be ignorant--</l>

								through you. Each of you is my kin, coming where I came from, going whither I shall
								go, out of darkness before the morning, back somewhere after the day.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>O my friend! you should have seen me playing seriously many parts in the human
								comedy; you should have seen me puffed up with learning, and stepping the nimble
								step of fashion, with platitudes and quiet flattery on my lips, wearing the
								political social smile. (I could do them perfectly.) Long, too, with a sad kind of
								joy, have I made a specialty of virtue; and then in days of inner flame have I felt
								in me the passion to swim a sea of lust.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The red weeds of vengeance have poisoned my reason; and the dagger of death has
								trembled in my hand. I have sat in mighty earthly places with the rulers of men; and
								silently with seers have I seen this world grow small and dim, as I looked down upon
								it from the immortal thrones on the mountain tops of greater worlds.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I have worked with my hands day after day, and I know the joy; and I know the numb
								hell of overwork--the leech at the throat; I have been loved by many children, as if
								I were their father; and I have been looked upon with suspicion.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>There you go--all who have passed in and out me. I know each of you; and as you,
								singing audibly or <pb n="181" id="VAA9478-180"/> inaudibly, passing me on the
								highway, have nourished me, so would I have you sit and rest yourself in the shadow
								of my faith. Now in this hour of still dawn would I whisper to you the faith that is
								in me. I would banish civilization, and turn mankind loose over this emerald field
								sparkling with dew.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>This burst of sunlight out of the east, this mystery of the dawning, has filled me
								with a new peace, and I lay aside the cares of life and sit with smiling face in the
								doorway of the world; and the many persons I have been are unified and yield to the
								world beyond the senses--the world of the soul.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>O you who are looking downward with still face, sitting with unlighted candles in
								the house of life, and you surrounded by the noise of the crowded world with its
								cruelty and haste, and you unloved one with starving heart, and you who have failed,
								sitting beside the ashes of grandeur that is past--</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>You, all of you, shall yet be filled, though I know not how, and the dream shall
								one day meet you face to face as a thing that is real, and you will embrace it

								from me, I abide as <pb n="184" id="VAA9478-183"/> one who has; and though my
								triumphs exist only in the painted world of my brain, I live as if indeed the laurel
								had pressed my brow, and my song had mingled a little with the music of the

						<head rend="center">THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT</head>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">H</hi>AVE I spoken in vain, or has some one somewhere understood me?
								Have I bared my breast to dead book-shelves, and shall the tenderness that has
								bloomed in me wither like some wild plant in an unfrequented forest?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The world that passes by me in fevered haste knows me not; nor takes me by the
								hand, for what shall it profit any man loving only things to be my friend?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Once my poems mingled with the thoughts of two lovers in a wood; and once an old
								man told me that I had given him courage to live;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And these things have I lovingly nursed in my soul; and as many flowers grow from a
								single seed, so full a hundred songs have bloomed in me, out of the thought that my
								task had not been all in vain.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And now I know that the things of the spirit that are given will return
								sometime--maybe only after long years, but they will return.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Meanwhile you who serve and wait, linger here a moment and rest in the shadow of my
								faith; for the things I give, you will give to me again--perhaps when I wander lost
								in the night in the city of strange experience.</l>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">W</hi>HEN I wander in places of greed for gain I have no desire; the
								grass of the meadow and the stars of the night comfort me. Though darkness overcome
								me, I shall not despair; the God of my youth still abides with me. He showeth me the
								palaces of the rich and the haunts of the poor, yet keepeth sweet my soul. When
								weariness overtakes me, I lie down in slumber, and the peace of the world is upon
								me. Though poverty abide with me, I pray that courage and gentleness forsake me not.
								And with all living things out of the earth and out of other worlds I believe I
								shall grow in the fields of God forever.</l>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">D</hi>AYS and weeks, months and years pass and we grow old; the senses
								respond more and more slowly to sight and sound, desire withers like a flower out of
								season, and passion perishes on the snows of many winters.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Hope of grand deeds, like a memory, returns less and less often; and the fine
								daring of youth lies lifeless in the comfort of some little corner of the world.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Dreams vanish, ambitions are forgotten, and the passion of love warms no more the
								hearthstones of the human heart.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Melodies pass unheard in the singing winds, and the whispers of evening twilight
								enchant no more.</l>
						</lg>

							<l>O age, where is thy fulfillment of youth!</l>

						<pb n="186" id="VAA9478-185"/>

						<lg>
							<l>We go out like a candle that is spent, vanish like the waters of a sunken river,
								and are forgotten like a garment that is cast aside.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>If this is all, then life is water that does not quench the thirst, tears that do
								not unburden the heart. Then the crimson lure in the west at sunset is a lie, and
								vainly burns the candle in the heart of hope.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But surely this is not all. Every star is a witness that this is not all.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And what if to die is but to awaken out of a dreaming sleep--to awaken in a room
								with doors that lead to every chamber in the household of the universe, alike to the
								subterranean caverns of an ant-hill and to the mammoth palaces built on infinitely
								distant worlds that wander through the night in their luster of gold!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And you who quarrel with me at the market, and contend with me upon the street, you
								shall see, when I am dead, how still I shall lie, and with what peace my face is
								composed.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But you shall not see me, for I shall have slipped away.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Oh, I am over anxious to know how I shall conduct myself when I have slipped

						<head rend="center">THE HOUSE INSIDE</head>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">I</hi> WANDER again inside myself, door after door I open, pass
								through, and close again slowly, noiselessly.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The outer world I leave behind, I hear no more the noise of the street, and I see
								no more the sights of daily life.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>As I pass from chamber to chamber in the house of my soul, everything becomes more
								and more quiet. Now I pause a moment in the still room which is not far removed from
								the inner chamber of the quick of me.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>All passion, all desire, all possession are stripped from me; the world of the
								senses is gone, and a light not of the world but of the inner world guides my
								steps.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Color and shape are gone; something like music but not music I hear and yet hear
								not. Something like feeling, but neither of pleasure nor pain, presses gently
								against me at the heart of myself.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The next chamber and the next, and I stand face to face with the flame, the spirit,
								the God. It seems to me it must be a chamber of mother-of-pearl, with living iris
								hues, and a flame of saffron--a still flame of saffron. I tremble, for the house has
								grown strange to me, and I feel I shall lose my way. I have passed the chambers of
								human speech and can therefore explain no more save in symbols. I search for
								symbols.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>It seems like a light, a still, warm light with a face in it, the face of the human
								soul, the face of the faint and changeless smile, noiseless, eternal, gentle, oh!
								very gentle.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb n="188" id="VAA9478-187"/>

						<lg>
							<l>This I say, though I have not yet passed the last door. I have lost my way, fear
								overtakes me, I can remember nothing, it seems that I am sinking, a piercing chill
								runs through my body, I tremble and shriek inwardly, I retrace my steps, groping in
								the dark, urging my will as with an iron spear, I hurry out, away, back to the
								chamber of memory and imagination, back to the world of speech, then out of doors to
								the world of sight and sound and color.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I lack the full measure of courage, yet I remember that I stood in the ante-chamber
								of my soul.</l>

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">D</hi>O NOT think I am one who would cover with sweet speech the
								tragedies of life.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>It seems to me that I have drunk the lees of every poison, and sat at midnight with
								every woe.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Thrice have I stood on a precipice and looked into the caverns of the nether world,
								and thrice have been recalled by the voice of a friend.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I have ached in body from toil, and hope has died in me a thousand times.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I walked out in youth with Christ in my soul and was crucified at the first
								crossing.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Curses have been given me for kindness, and the tongue of hate has mingled my name
								with poison.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>So low has courage ebbed in me that I have asked nothing of the world but a corner
								in which to breathe and hide my face.</l>
						</lg>
						<pb n="189" id="VAA9478-188"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Years of patient toil, instead of wealth and the good-will of friends, brought me,
								want and the sneers of them I loved.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Oh, how I should have joyed in one kind word and the touch of a sympathetic
								hand!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Sorrow, fear, envy, hate, bitterness, passed in and out of me, like miasmatic fumes
								from the foul places of the earth.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The God of my youth was dead, and on His grave danced the devils of every sin.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Vulgarity triumphed over gentleness, and the fat tradesman was master of them that
								are sweet in spirit.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Every ideal I had was the mother of a brood of sorrows, for to follow a vision in a
								land of bog is death.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And the end of all human effort is as the grass of a forgotten summer.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Yet through the night of this despair again and again have burst the rays of
								morning.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And in the dim light I have bound the broken chords of life.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Out of the winter of the past have crept the buds of spring, and once again have I
								planted love in my heart, and therefore found love in others.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The lips of malice have at last whispered a gentle word and courage was born in me
								again.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Toil, though it brought not what I sought, brought something, and nursed again to
								life the withered blooms of hope.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb n="190" id="VAA9478-189"/>
						<lg>
							<l>The dogmas of the world that bound me to pain I cut, as with a knife;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And now I wander freely, taking counsel of my human nature and the love of life,
								lingering where I will, denying me nothing.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And through the mist of the world I seem to see again the God of my youth; but
								grown older, gentler, and more compassionate, as I myself am older and more
								compassionate.</l>
