            <p>Although the history of the St. Lawrence waterway project might suggest a
                    different conclusion, it is a well-established fact that the American people
                    have always been keenly interested in water transportation and have generally
                    indicated a willingness to support at public expense navigation improvements
                    which have national importance. Particularly was this true in the early history
                    of the republic when railroads were unknown, roads were few in number and
                    abominable in quality, and waterways provided the most satisfactory highways
                    into the interior. The purpose of this paper is to suggest some of the reasons
                    for the early emergence of American interest in the development of waterway
                    connections between the Eastern Seaboard and the settlements west of the
                    Appalachians and to indicate some of the actions that were taken looking toward
                    the development of such connections.</p>
            <p>First, however, it may be helpful to comment briefly on the physiography of the
                    area under review, that is to say, the portion of the present-day <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    </placeName> River. The most prominent feature of this region is, of course, the
                    Appalachian mountain range, 300 miles in width and 1,300 miles long, which
                    extends from the Green Mountains of <placeName>

                    transportation into the interior.</p>
            <p>The forests and the exceedingly dense undergrowth which covered the mountains
                    increased the difficulty of passage, while the rivers of the eastern slope,
                    since they were not navigable far back from the coast, afforded no ready access
                    to the interior. These rivers, however, when followed to their headwaters,
                    revealed occasional passes which were early discovered and used by explorers,
                    fur traders, military expeditions, and would-be settlers. The easiest pathway to
                    the West was by way of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, which passed over a region
                    gradually rising from near sea level to a maximum of some 578 feet.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> In <placeName>

                    was another route by the Juniata to a tributary of the Allegheny. Virginians
                    went up the valley of the Potomac and by a short portage to the Youghiogheny.
                    Other routes lay up the James River and down the Great Valley to the Greenbrier

            <p>The first prominent American to give serious attention to the problem of
                    penetrating this mountain range and of linking the East with the West was George
                    Washington, farsighted and enterprising citizen of <placeName>

                    later as an astute businessman interested in finding buyers for his extensive
                    western lands, Washington came to feel keenly the need for improved
                    transportation facilities between the eastern states and the settlements west of
                    the Appalachians.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> More important still, he indicated an
                    eagerness to lend his support to any project calculated to bring about the

                    endeavor, he introduced a bill to empower individuals to subscribe to the

                    modification, the project was strongly opposed, particularly by spokesmen of the
                    central portion of the colony. To allay the hostility of this populous region,
                    an amendment providing for the improvement of navigation of the James River was
                    added to the bill. So amended, the bill was enacted early in 1772.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Implementation of the act, however, was dependent upon the enactment

                    of these discussions may be judged from an examination of letters exchanged
                    between Jefferson and Washington in March, 1784.</p>
            <p>This was the moment, Jefferson wrote, for uniting the commerce of the
                    Youghiogheny and Cheat rivers with that of the Potomac. All the world was
                    "becoming commercial." Were it practicable to keep the new
                    American empire separated from other countries, "we might indulge
                    ourselves in speculating whether commerce contributes to the happiness of
                    mankind. But we cannot separate ourselves from them. … We must then
                    in our own defence endeavor to share as large a portion as we can of this modern
                    source of wealth and power." The Potomac, the Hudson, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> were all possible routes, but the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>-Potomac, because it was the most direct, was potentially the best
                    of the three. But if its natural advantages were to be fully realized, the
                    channels of its rivers would have to be cleared and canals would have to be
                    provided around the falls and rapids. He had been urging the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> legislature to create a special fund to finance these needed
                    improvements, but he had met with the objection "that public
                    undertakings are carlessly [sic] managed and much money spent to little
                    purpose." If Washington would be willing to direct the state's
                    navigation improvement activities, Jefferson wrote, this objection would be
                    removed. But he did not wish to over-persuade. If the superintendence of the
                    work would too much disturb his friend's "retirement and
                    repose" he would say no more.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Washington replied that he agreed with Jefferson on the advantages of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>-Potomac communication "over <hi rend="i">all</hi>
                    others." Furthermore, he was "satisfied that not a moment
                    ought to be lost in recommencing this business." As soon as the British
                    had surrendered the posts of Oswego and Niagara, "the Yorkers"
                    would lose no time in improving the Hudson-Mohawk route. It behooved <placeName>

                    </placeName> to be equally energetic. Certainly it was in the interest of both
                    colonies "to remove obstructions, and to invite the trade of the
                    Western territory" into the channels of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>-Potomac route. But Washington had serious misgivings as to whether
                    the project could be carried out as a public enterprise. <list type="footnotes">

                    and the difficulty of apportioning funds between the two colonies, there was
                    "the impracticability of bringing the great, and truly wise policy of
                    the measure" to the view of the people, and "the difficulty of
                    drawing money from them, for such a purpose." Nevertheless, he was
                    convinced that, considering "the immense advantages which this Country
                    would derive from this measure," no effort should be spared to launch
                    the enterprise. Concerning the proposal that he personally direct a state
                    program of internal improvements, Washington stated in his letter that his
                    decision would depend on a number of factors, including the size and nature of
                    the program and whether or not acceptance of the position would interfere with
                    any other plan he had in contemplation.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    Washington developed at some length certain arguments stressing the need for

                    would serve as a potent force in strengthening the bonds of union between the

                    needed not the gift of prophecy. The only real safeguard was to bind the

                    a businessman interested in the fur trade—would derive from the
                    opening of improved communication. Nor was he losing sight of the advantages
                    that would accrue to his native state. In fact, in his letter to Harrison he
                    refers to <placeName>

                    construction concerns of the day<hi rend="sup">24</hi>—caused many
                    Americans to conclude that private companies had neither the money nor the
                    engineering skill needed to carry out major transportation projects. At the same
                    time, the high tolls and the arbitrary actions of some of the turnpike companies
                    aroused so much popular resentment that increasing numbers of public spirited
                    citizens began wondering whether the construction and control of roads and
                    canals were not matters of too much public interest to be left largely to
                    private enterprise.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> The cumulative result was the
                    gradually increasing and widespread demand for a larger measure of governmental
                    participation in the construction and maintenance of essential transportation
                    facilities.</p>
            <p>The first appeal was to the states. But as the history of the Potomac enterprise
                    had conclusively demonstrated, the states were not eager to assume the
                        responsibility.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> They were willing to make grants to
                    help finance important improvements, but they preferred that the bother and the
                    principal expense of construction should rest with private enterprise. Their
                    supply of ready capital was limited. Their credit standing was none too high,
                    some of them having repudiated debts contracted in the revolutionary era. To
                    attempt to raise money by increasing taxes was considered politically
                    inexpedient. Action by the states was made still more difficult by the bitter

            <p>The remaining alternative was federal construction. For several reasons the
                    federal government seemed the logical entity to undertake any needed
                    improvements. It had competent army engineers; it had extensive sources of
                    revenue; and it was in a better position than either the states or private
                    companies to formulate and carry into effect an integrated system of internal
                    improvements. But its qualifications were more apparent than real. The
                    government had assumed a tremendous burden of debt; political and sectional
                    strife were rife; and its leaders had yet to prove their ability to hold
                    together the newly-created Union. Most important of all, the constitutional
                    authority of the federal government to construct and maintain roads and canals
                    was still widely challenged. Thus everything considered, the likelihood that the

                    improvements did not seem particularly bright.</p>
            <p>For a time, that is to say until near the close of the nineteenth century, the
                    settlers of the West indicated very little interest in the various schemes being
                    attempted or proposed for linking the East with the West. Of course, they
                    favored the improvement of transportation; but they did not view the matter as
                    of urgent importance. Their numbers were few; their wants were insignificant;
                    their surplus produce could generally be disposed of by floating it down the <placeName>

                    subsiding, and the federal authorities, possibly as a consequence, seemed more
                    inclined to sponsor transportation-development programs.</p>
            <p>One of the first indications of this new federal concern with internal
                    improvements was the inclusion in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Enabling Act of 1802 of a provision obligating Congress to set
                    aside 5 per cent of the proceeds of the public lands sold within that state for
                    the construction of roads.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Some of the roads were to be in
                    the state; others were to join the <placeName>

                    cent was speedily appropriated for roadmaking within the state,<hi rend="sup">43</hi> only 2 per cent was left to be expended on highways outside the state.
                    Yet small as the latter percentage was, it had, by December 1805, produced
                        $12,600.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> On the recommendation of a Senate
                        committee,<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Congress voted in 1806 to apply this money
                    towards the construction of a turnpike from Cumberland, on the <placeName>

                    delay in the selection of a route, contracts were not awarded until 1811 and the
                    section of the road to Wheeling was not opened to traffic until 1817.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Nevertheless, by creating the 5 per cent fund and by
                    voting appropriations for the National Turnpike, Congress had taken steps that
                    served as precedents for the improvement of waterways, as well as for the
                    construction of state roads and national turnpikes.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>Another significant federal move was the introduction in the Senate, February 23,
                    1807, of a motion by John Quincy Adams calling on the President to authorize the
                    Secretary of the Treasury to prepare and report a plan for a general system of
                    internal improvements.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Adams, a great admirer of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was strongly of the opinion that highways were essential to the
                    development and strengthening of the nation, and that such improvements should
                    be built by public agencies, since private construction would result in the
                    subordination of the common welfare to private profit.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> His
                    motion was defeated by a vote of 16 to 12.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> A few days
                    later, however, Thomas Worthington, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, secured the passage of a resolution similar to that of Adams by
                    the impressive vote of 22 to 3.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In December of the preceding year, President Jefferson had suggested that the
                    surpluses of the treasury be applied "to the great purposes of the
                    public education, roads, rivers, canals, and such other objects of public
                    improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration
                    of Federal powers."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Accordingly, he now lost no
                    time in instructing Secretary Albert Gallatin to carry out the Senate
                    recommendation. The result was the justly famed report of April 4, 1808.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This report involved both careful thought and the collection of a vast amount of
                    data from local sources. It argued that, in view of the relative scarcity of
                    capital and "the extent of territory compared to the
                    population," the federal government was the proper agency to carry out
                    the needed improvements. It stressed the advantages of a complete and carefully
                    planned system, in contrast to a partial and helter-skelter development. No
                    single road or canal would attain its maximum usefulness unless it were fitted
                    into a framework designed to develop the nation as a whole. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The two main objectives, Gallatin averred, were: (1) to connect the states along
                    a north-south axis, and (2) to bring the settlers beyond the mountains into easy

            <p>The cost of the above improvements, Gallatin estimated, would not exceed
                    $16,000,000. But the Secretary suggested—in a sentence
                    that strikingly attested to the strength of the local and sectional conflicts of
                    the day—that considerations of "policy no less than
                    justice" required the allocation of an extra $3,400,000 for
                    the financing of "local improvements" in states which would
                    not benefit directly from the suggested major improvements. To carry out the
                    entire program, Congress was to pledge $2,000,000 of the annual
                    surplus for ten years in advance; and the twenty millions thus spent might be
                    partly or wholly replaced by selling to private corporations the canals and
                    turnpikes as they should become productive; or the public money might at the
                    outset be loaned to private corporations for purposes of construction.</p>
            <p>The report was read April 6, 1808. A time less propitious could not have been
                    chosen. The embargo had been in effect three months. Trade and commerce were in
                    decline, the whole frontier was in commotion, President Jefferson <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-052-4-021"/> was on the point of declaring the people of the
                    region around Lake Champlain to be in a state of insurrection, and the treasury
                    surplus was fast melting away. Under these circumstances, the Senate did no more
                    than order that twelve hundred copies of the report be printed and that six be
                    given to each member of Congress.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certain congressmen, however, were not willing to let the matter drop. In
                    January, 1810, Senator John Pope, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, introduced a bill to authorize a system of internal improvements
                    substantially the same as that recommended by Gallatin.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
                    But instead of federal construction and direct appropriations, the measure
                    called for federal subscription to the stock of state-chartered corporations and
                    for government borrowing on the security of the public lands. When no action was
                    taken on this particular bill, Porter presented to the House of Representatives,
                    February 8, 1810, a resolution to appoint a committee to examine the expediency
                    of appropriating public lands for "the opening and constructing such
                    roads and canals as may be most conducive to the general interests of the
                        Union."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> The suggestion was accepted and a
                    committee of twenty, with Porter as chairman, was forthwith appointed. Later the
                    same month the committee recommended that the government should subscribe for
                    one-half of the stock of any corporation which had been, or which should be,
                    chartered to carry on the works suggested by Gallatin's report.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Congress, however, was not prepared to do more, and the
                    session ended without action. The same was true of the session that followed. By
                    the summer of 1812 the country was at war and all federal internal improvement
                    projects not of an urgent nature were indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p>But many Americans—particularly the War Hawks of the
                    West—expected the war itself to provide at least a partial solution
                    to the east-west transportation problem. This it was expected to do by bringing
                    about the speedy defeat of Britain, the annexation of <placeName>

                    these high expectations were not realized. In fact, it was only a favorable
                    combination of circumstances that enabled the new republic to emerge from the
                    war without the loss of territory or the limited privilege it enjoyed in the use
                    of the St. Lawrence River.</p>
            <p>The war did do one thing, however, and that was to demonstrate in an emphatic
                    manner the urgent need for improved east-west transportation facilities. It was
                    found, for example, that a piece of ordnance worth $400 at the
                    foundry had cost $2,000 when delivered on the frontier and that flour
                    had cost $100 per barrel and oats $60 per bushel.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Army regulations allowed officers "two dollars
                    per 100 pounds per 100 miles" for the transportation of their
                        baggage.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> The almost universal opinion was that had
                    improved roads and canals been in existence during the war the armed forces
                    would not only have operated more effectively but millions of dollars would have
                    been saved on transportation costs.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> It was further agreed
                    that the absence of satisfactory roads was one of the reasons that the war had
                    not been more loyally supported by some of the eastern states.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Thus the absence of a ready American market for their surplus produce

                    distant markets significantly increased. Concurrently with the influx of
                    settlers went the introduction of the steamboat to the western rivers and the
                    extension of cotton culture into the Southwest. The first of these developments
                    brought improved transportation to all areas with navigable waters; the second
                    opened up a very profitable field for the employment of labor and capital and
                    gave rise to an important trade in agricultural produce upon the western
                        rivers.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> The prosperity which came to the southern and
                    western populations increased their ability to purchase such manufactures as
                    they required and thus provided eastern manufacturers with a rapidly expanding
                    market. An eager rivalry developed among the commercial cities of the seaboard
                    to secure a share of the western trade. "The West ceased to be a mere
                    refuge of poverty and field for the adventure of pioneers. The enterprise and
                    capital of the country turned away from the ocean and foreign commerce, and
                    found here a new field for its operation."<hi rend="sup">67</hi>

            <p>But, mainly for three reasons, private capital did not flow in any great volume
                    into transportation. First and most important, capital was extremely scarce.
                    Secondly, most Americans with capital were unwilling to devote their savings to
                    risky investments or to those from which a return would be slow as well as
                    uncertain. Thirdly, persons abroad looking for investment opportunities
                    preferred to lend their money to governmental entities or to corporations whose
                    securities were backed by governmental guarantees.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> Since
                    the federal government had greater prestige, as well as a greater taxing power

                    peace "had been resumed with renovated vigor." Political
                    developments in Europe had tended to emphasize the importance of domestic
                    commerce. Since 1808 the annual revenue had grown from $14,000,000 to
                    "an average of twenty-five millions." The various parts of the
                    country had indicated a lively interest in the improvement of transportation
                    facilities. Most important of all, it was essential to provide without delay

                    estimated at 60 millions of acres"—bordering on Lake
                    Champlain, the St. Lawrence River, and the Great Lakes. Until such outlets were
                    provided "all the productions of this extensive district"
                    would continue to be drawn to the British ports of Lower <placeName>

                    of all the north western indian tribes within our limits." Only by an
                    improved inland navigation could the whole commerce of that region "be

            <p>Nor would the cost be excessive. Federal aid need not exceed
                    $10,000,000. This might take the form of subscriptions to the stock
                    of private companies chartered by the states to carry out the general plan. The
                    many and varied ensuing benefits would include: (1) an increase in the value of
                    land and in the revenues of the central government; (2) a <list type="footnotes">

                    measures for ascertaining as far as practicable, and to report to the House

            <p>The report was not to receive further consideration. At the time of its
                    submission the attention of the House was wholly engrossed by a bill from a
                    select committee appointed on motion of John C. Calhoun. This bill provided that

                    encourage a westward migration that was already threatening to depopulate the
                    Eastern Seaboard. Furthermore, her spokesmen argued that, since New <placeName>

                    for roads in other sections of the country. But the voting strength of the

                    to construct roads and canals within the individual states. But, since the
                    proposed law dealt with matters of great importance, he hoped that "its

                    improvements at federal expense, came as a challenge. In an important debate on

                    decided against the power to construct post roads and military roads (82 ayes to

                    between the states (71 to 95); and against the power to construct canals for

                    majority were unwilling to hazard the rights which they claimed to possess by
                    appealing to the states for a constitutional amendment. What was to be done? In
                    1819 the President approved a bill authorizing the employment of the army in the
                    construction of roads of military significance,<hi rend="sup">78</hi> and under
                    this authorization several important roads were constructed. But this, as
                    everyone realized, was only a makeshift, in no sense a substitute for a
                    comprehensive construction program. In 1822 Congress approved a bill authorizing
                    the President to cause tollhouses, gates, and turnpikes to be erected on the
                    Cumberland Road and to appoint toll-gatherers with power to enforce the
                    collection of tolls to be used for the upkeep of the road.<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
                    The President vetoed the bill on the ground that it implied a power to adopt and
                    execute a complete system of internal improvements, a power which he was certain
                    the Congress did not possess and the states individually could not grant.</p>
            <p>The failure of the federal government to accept the position of leadership in the
                    development of transportation facilities meant that if east-west water
                    connections were to be established they would have to be provided by the states.
                    Nothing loath, the states accepted the challenge and plunged into a program of
                    canal and road construction the like of which the country had never seen before.

            <p>The states, forced to depend primarily on their own resources, no doubt learned
                    something about the virtues of self-reliance. But some of the other consequences
                    of state development of transportation routes were not so praiseworthy. The
                    highways, built without the benefit of central direction or national planning,
                    were sometimes routed in such a manner as to divert traffic from the
                    transportation systems of neighboring states. More serious still, priority of
                    construction was not always given to the projects best calculated to promote the
                    development of the nation as a whole. Competition did not reach the cut-throat
                    stage, but it did prevent the development of a comprehensive, integrated system
                    of transportation. It also encouraged the states to spend more money than they
                    could well afford, making them vulnerable to the onslaught of the Panic of 1837.
                    The credit side of the ledger, however, is more weighty than the debit. Even
                    though of all the important canals only the Erie was a financial success, all of
                    the major state-developed waterway improvements reduced transportation costs,
                    stimulated east-west trade, and contributed significantly to the development of
                    the extensive regions that they served.<hi rend="sup">82</hi> More important
                    still, by helping to bind the West to the East by "the strong chains of
                    commerce," they made a contribution of immeasurable importance to the
                    steadying and strengthening of the Federal Union.</p>

            <p>While club activities encouraged literary appreciation and gave numerous writers
                    their chief opportunity for self-expression, many in <placeName>

                    </placeName> wrote for occasional publication and some were truly professional.
                    The press rendered a great service to many professional writers by providing
                    employment to satisfy their immediate needs and by acting as a stepping stone
                    toward an independent literary career. Of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> fraternity of letters, those most widely known to the general
                    reader are James Whitcomb Riley, Meredith Nicholson, and Booth Tarkington. In
                    the 1880's, Tarkington was still in school and had not yet turned
                    professional; Meredith Nicholson was getting valuable experience writing both
                    for the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> and the <hi rend="i">News.</hi> Neither
                    Tarkington nor Nicholson was able to establish himself as an independent
                    professional writer until about the turn of the century when their first
                    successful publications appeared. Both were much influenced by the example of
                    Riley and by the friendly advice which he was always ready to give to young and
                    struggling authors.<hi rend="sup">145</hi>

                    reputation which has since gathered considerable legend around it. These years
                    were not easy ones. By joining the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> staff in November,
                    1879, at a salary of $25.00 a week, he was enabled to live while he
                    worked to perfect his writing technique.<hi rend="sup">146</hi> Until the
                    publication of his first book in 1883, he commonly wrote under assumed names,
                    such as "Benj. F. Johnson of Boone," "John C.

                    signatures which appeared on his letters to close friends, for instance,
                    "Doc Marigold," "Brother Whittleford,"
                    "Uncle Sidney," "Troubled Tom," and
                    "Old E. Z. Mark." Once he signed a poem for Edward Bok, editor

            <p>Though he wrote some prose, it did not rank with his poetry, for which he is best

                    George C. Hitt, business manager of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, acted as his
                    publisher to bring out the first Riley book, <hi rend="i">"The Old

                    entire edition of one thousand copies was quickly sold, netting a profit of
                    $166.40. Unable to persuade the Robert Clarke Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    to Riley.<hi rend="sup">150</hi> Concerning this book the <hi rend="i">News</hi>
                    commented: "Mr. Riley shows himself an artist of no mean order.
                    … Although immensely popular, and destined in its present handy and
                    tasteful form to have a wider reading, this work is much in the nature of a
                    diversion, and does not contain Mr. Riley's best and more serious
                    efforts. These will doubtless follow in other volumes in time. This very modest
                    and altogether pleasing volume is for sale at all the book stores for fifty

            <p>Later in 1883, soon after this first edition was exhausted, a second appeared

                    Publication of the second edition was perhaps the turning point or climax for
                    literary culture in the Inland City, for it was to set a standard by which
                    accomplishment in the publishing field would in the future be measured. It
                    further proved to be a happy occasion for both author and publisher, for it

            </p>
            <p>The publishing firm of Merrill, Meigs and Company possessed an old as well as a
                    broad and distinguished background in both bookselling and in the publication of
                    legal books. In fact, its history antedated the Hoosier capital, for one of its
                    founders, Samuel Merrill, was noted for his erudition and love of books, perhaps
                    even sold books, before coming to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the 1820's. Riley, on the other hand, was a man of
                    simple human qualities, unassuming and modest, who took no credit for his
                    poetry, claimed no unusual ability, and insisted that he was only the instrument
                    for the inspiration which flowed through his pen.<hi rend="sup">154</hi> He was
                    without formal education, as far as college training was concerned, yet he
                    possessed a knowledge of people that no college course could have given him. By
                    whatever means he acquired this wisdom, it contributed to his writings an appeal
                    which reached deep into the hearts of his readers of every station.</p>
            <p>A gentle humor was characteristic of both his writing and his speaking. Those
                    still living who remember him well feel that this was his outstanding
                        quality.<hi rend="sup">155</hi> His humor was not of a hilarious sort; a
                    note of pathos was always present so that the laughter he caused was often close
                    to tears. Whether or not he was a great poet—critics continue to
                    disagree over the quality of his contribution—he was an important one
                    for Indiana. The Hoosier poet was on the threshold of a national and
                    international reputation.</p>
            <p>The editors of the Bobbs-Merrill Company recall those regular morning visits in
                    later years when Riley would drop in to open his mail, to warm his hands by the
                    great open fireplace—a feature of the publishing house on the south
                    side of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Street—and perhaps to confer briefly with his editor.
                    The poet often kept "in character" a week at a time and,
                    during one of those periods, came in each day as "Brother
                    Brightwaters," a lay reader from down state; such performances, of
                    course, were a never-ending source of entertainment for the entire staff of the
                    firm. No formal contracts were ever made, for Riley professed an aversion <list type="footnotes">

                    two of which were reissues of his first book, and three others collected
                    editions of his writings in both verse and prose. All but nine of these titles

                    relationship, of course, would indicate that it was regarded as mutually
                    profitable, and the progress of the firm in what was for them a completely new
                    subject-matter field was indeed prophetic. Present local evidences of

                    </placeName> at the Grand Opera House before a large audience. His critic noted
                    that he showed much improvement over his last appearance but that "a
                    little more of the polished art of the reader would not injure the introductory
                    part of the entertainment."<hi rend="sup">163</hi> In addition to his

                    </placeName>, adding valuable experience to his natural ability. In 1881 he
                    signed a contract with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau and began work with them after
                    Christmas of that year. His first appearance under the new management was at

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    </placeName>, on January 3, 1882.<hi rend="sup">164</hi> Since apparently no
                    further reference to Redpath was made, it is not known just how long this
                    association continued.</p>
            <p>In 1886 the Riley-Nye combination began. Their first performance was given at the
                    Grand Opera House in February in collaboration with Eugene Field, who had come
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the event. Bill (Edgar Wilson) Nye, the well-known humorist,
                    was no novice at this time but it was Field's stage debut. Mrs. John C.
                    New and Miss Sallie Bingham provided the musical part of the program. One of the
                    best audiences ever gathered in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> greeted the performers with a reception almost embarrassing in its
                    warmth. The affair was indeed a success.<hi rend="sup">165</hi> From this
                    beginning the partnership of Nye and Riley continued about five years. Mark
                    Twain and George W. Cable had successfully swung around the circuit before them,
                    and it is quite probable that the Riley-Nye performances were equally effective.
                    Both humorists, their alternate appearances on the program usually consisted of
                    attempts to out-insult each other, to the delight of the audience.
                    Riley's part always included a number of original readings, well
                    interspersed with anecdotes as only he could tell them.<hi rend="sup">166</hi>

            <p>Riley had embarked upon a gruelling schedule, one which would tax the endurance
                    of a far sturdier person than he appeared to be. There was some complaint that
                    this work was causing him to sacrifice his writing. This was no doubt justified;
                    yet in the face of such criticism a thirty-weeks' tour was planned with
                    the Western Lyceum Agency for the winter and spring of 1889–1890.
                    This tour was a great success, financially and otherwise, for all concerned
                    except Riley, who continued to receive but $40.00 a performance when
                    the box office receipts for a single evening totaled as much as
                    $1,600. But Nye had managed better than Riley and was growing richer.
                    Friction developed between them, doubtless because of this situation and also
                    because Riley, fatigued by his heavy schedule, had taken to drink. Finally at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in January, 1890, Riley lost his temper and broke the contract
                    which would soon have come to an end anyway. But in spite of the fact that they
                    were no longer business partners, the two managed to continue their friendship.
                    Riley feared the reaction of his public at home toward this turn of events but
                    was relieved when the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Literary Club accorded him a most heart-warming reception upon his
                        return.<hi rend="sup">168</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1887 Riley was honored by an invitation to participate in the American
                    Author's Entertainment sponsored by the International Copyright League,
                    at Chickering Hall, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. The League had been holding similar annual meetings for ten years,
                    but this was the first time Riley had been invited to participate and probably
                    the first time any writer from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been so honored. The program, held November 28–29,
                    1887, was presided over by James Russell <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>

                    Henry Cuyler Bunner, Edward Eggleston, George W. Cable, and Mark Twain. Unknown
                    at the outset, Riley read with success and received an ovation from his
                    audience. He was invited to return to Chickering Hall the following February to
                    participate in a program planned by Augustin Daly to honor Henry Irving and

            <p>Before 1880 Riley had had five portraits made; the first of these, by Theodore C.
                    Steele, is the only one the whereabouts of which was known in 1938, when it was
                    owned by members of the Riley family. One of the lost portraits was by John Love
                    and another by Fred Hetherington. In 1893, Steele had returned from Europe and
                    painted one of the greatest of the Riley portraits, which was presented to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Press Club and later found its way to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Literary Club. The seventh portrait also was made by Steele on
                    commission from the Bobbs-Merrill Company. In 1900 John Singer Sargent made the
                    eighth, generally known as the official Riley portrait, which became the
                    possession of the John Herron Art Museum. The ninth and last portrait, painted
                    by Steele in 1912, is a copy of the 1893 portrait and now hangs in the Riley
                    Hospital at the Indiana University Medical Center.<hi rend="sup">170</hi>

            <p>Riley was one of those uncommon individuals who received the plaudits of his
                    fellow townsmen during his lifetime. They loved the wit and humor of his private
                    conversation and were charmed by his personality.<hi rend="sup">171</hi>
                    "His incompetence—real or pretended—in many
                    directions was one of the most delightful things about him."<hi rend="sup">172</hi> His critics have divided on the question of whether he
                    really loved children. Meredith Nicholson stated that Riley's
                    "wide popularity as a poet of childhood was due to a special genius for
                    understanding the child mind. Yet he was shy in the presence of children, and
                    though he … could establish himself on good terms with them, he
                    seemed uncomfortable when suddenly confronted by a strange child."<hi rend="sup">173</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was always the human element that appealed to him. The people he knew were his
                    chief interest in life. Riley "comprehended one great truth that few
                    poets, and for that matter few other writers, learn, namely, that unlettered
                    folk have the same emotional experiences which their more <list type="footnotes">

                    tongue, a dubious dialect as yet unidentified by any philologist—but
                    a figure so convincing that even the Hoosier himself was persuaded to proclaim

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">196</hi> Then came a period of writing during which
                    his only published works were occasional short sketches in periodicals. His
                    first novel, <hi rend="i">The Gentleman from Indiana</hi>, was published in
                    1899. The initial phase of his writing was devoted to praise and glorification
                    of life in the Hoosier capital and in other Indiana towns. He defended
                    small-town ways and middle-class thinking. Although he made no attempt at
                    historical accuracy, his novels and essays contributed much to the history of
                    the time by his portrayal of the change which began to take place in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the end of the 1880's when the coming of natural gas
                    hastened the transformation of the city into a manufacturing center. Older
                    residents who witnessed this change agree that Tarkington gave a true picture of
                    the social and cultural life of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as it was in the seventies and eighties and later as the face of
                    the town changed. "Like hundreds of others throughout the country, this
                    town, too, moved forward with the times, its old stock becoming less and less
                    typical, and newcomers with energy and business acumen taking their places of
                    community leadership. In the offspring of German, Jewish, Irish, Italian, and
                    other settlers 'a new Midlander—in fact, a new
                    American—was beginning dimly to emerge.' To this new spirit
                    of citizenship the magnificent Ambersons, reared in luxury, were unable to adapt
                    themselves. Others, with a heritage of labor, rapidly took high places as the
                    town progressed from village to market town to a manufacturing
                        city."<hi rend="sup">197</hi>

            <p>And this was Tarkington's contribution. He could interpret so well the
                    Inland City because he was a product of it and had had the advantage of the
                    example and inspiration of other writers of that period.</p>

                    in his successful career he became known as a political orator, and he delivered
                    many public addresses. His biographical works written much later were in some

                    represented. The sixty-four charter members, thirty-nine of whom were women,
                    were writers of poetry, fiction, historical and descriptive literature, and
                    dialect sketches. The object of this association was to encourage amateur
                    authors and to be of some advantage to professional authors.<hi rend="sup">200</hi> It was hoped that each member would present to the association an

            <p>The Indiana Historical Society, organized in 1830, had functioned so little in
                    its early years, except for brief periods of activity, that it hardly seemed to
                    exist. In 1886 it was reorganized by a group of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> men who inaugurated a publishing program. The first results
                    included a series of pamphlets, dated 1886–1888, which covered
                    subjects of statewide historical interest. Jacob P. Dunn, who served as
                    secretary of the Society from 1886 to 1924, was an important figure in this
                    renewed activity. William H. English was elected president in 1886, and under
                    his guidance the Society sought to aid the State Library in building up its
                    collection of books and pamphlets on Indiana history. About one thousand of
                    these had already been collected.<hi rend="sup">208</hi> Since in many sections

            <p>Probably no phase of literary life was more active in the eighties than the
                    lecture or lyceum. Courses were offered each year, and in addition, all the
                    outstanding lecturers in almost every field of thought in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    </placeName>, appeared in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the decade. The content of the many lyceum programs offered
                    ranged from pure entertainment to the serious and more learned subjects. Some
                    evidence indicates a deliberate attempt at education of young people through a
                    series of historical addresses. Probably adult education benefited from lectures
                    only incidentally, since popular interest seemed to be the only criterion for
                    the selection of speakers and subjects.</p>
            <p>A course of historical lectures for young people, aimed at inspiring them with
                    patriotism, and begun in 1885 largely through the efforts of Charity Dye and
                    Mary E. Nicholson, was given at <placeName>

                    series, which apparently continued from 1885 through the decade, was well

            <p>In the regular lecture or lyceum courses, a season's program generally
                    included a wide variety of topics, such as temperance, science, philosophy,
                    literature, and music. The series announced in 1885 by the <placeName>

            <p>Other famous persons who appeared in lyceum series during the 1880's
                    included John B. Gough, well-known temperance orator, who spoke in 1882, 1883,
                    and again in 1886. Mrs. Livermore spoke several times, as did Lew Wallace, Rev.
                    Myron W. Reed, and George W. Cable. In 1886, when two courses of six lectures
                    each were offered, the price was reduced to one dollar for six, though the
                    quality of the program was declared to be higher than formerly.<hi rend="sup">212</hi> In 1883 the aging Henry Ward Beecher spoke at the Park Theater. He
                    remarked that he saw no familiar faces, for it had been a generation since he
                    had given lectures in the city.<hi rend="sup">213</hi> His talk in 1884 was

                    </placeName> as a lecturer, but he did speak once more in 1886, a year before
                    his death.<hi rend="sup">214</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sponsors of the lyceum included the Young Men's Christian Association,

                    </placeName> Lecture Bureau (possibly the same as the preceding group). Other
                    groups which offered regular programs were: the Chautauqua Literary and

                    arranged for several talks on the Bible.<hi rend="sup">217</hi>

            <p>Many other lectures on various subjects were given during the 1880's
                    which may have been independent of the regular courses. Robert Ingersoll, famous
                    agnostic, lectured in 1880 on what seems for him a strange topic, "What
                    Must We Do To Be Saved?"<hi rend="sup">218</hi> In 1881, A. Bronson
                    Alcott spoke on the Concord authors; <hi rend="sup">219</hi> and later that
                    season during the same week both Ingersoll and Beecher gave lectures, the former
                    on "The Great Infidels," the latter on "The New

                    well received and later wrote his daughter that he "had a capital

            <p>The merger of the book-selling firms of Bowen, Stewart and Company and Merrill,
                    Meigs and Company in 1885 was the second step during the decade in the direction
                    of the position currently held by the Bobbs-Merrill Company in the publishing
                    field. In 1883 Merrill, Meigs had stepped into the general literary field of
                    publishing when William C. Bobbs arranged with George C. Hitt to take over
                        "<hi rend="i">The Old Swimmin'-hole</hi>" and get
                    out a second edition. As Riley phrased it, the firm had donned "its
                    literary overalls."<hi rend="sup">236</hi> Two years later, on December
                    31, 1884, the merger was effected and on January 1, 1885, the firm became known
                    as the Bowen-Merrill Company. That year its second Riley title was issued, and
                    two years later, in 1887, the third one appeared.<hi rend="sup">237</hi> During
                    the decade the publishing program already under way was continued. It included
                    law books, elementary arithmetic texts, and books for Sunday school teachers. In
                    later years Bowen-Merrill expanded its list of law books and public school texts
                    but discontinued its religious books, which were taken over by the Meigs

                    credit for two ideas which contributed much toward the progress made in the

                    appeal and become best-sellers, and the introduction of brightly illustrated

            <p>The entry of Bowen-Merrill into the trade book field was a strongly energizing

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in Indiana, and the entire Middle West. The firm in its own
                    biographical sketch declares that "there can be no doubt that the
                    presence of a publishing house stimulated her [Indiana's] literary
                    activities. The knowledge that effort would unquestionably be considered and
                    that obscurity was no bar to acceptance must have given hope to the ambitious,
                    must have, indeed, created ambition where ambition never grew before. The
                    influence not always concrete in its expression, is none the less potent, and
                    Indiana's literary life has felt it, whether it flowed through the
                    young local channel or through shores more definitely marked by the passage of
                    time.</p>
            <p>"Art can not thrive, lacking opportunity for expression, and the more
                    readily accessible the opportunity, the more abundant the striving. The
                    potential Hoosier author awoke and that amazingly productive era
                        began."<hi rend="sup">241</hi>

                    Its publication of the first Meredith Nicholson book in 1891 started another
                    mutually profitable relationship. The firm was indeed taking on the stature of a
                    Hoosier House. So far it had published only poetry in the trade field but in
                    1895 its first novel was issued: <hi rend="i">A Woman Reigns</hi>, by Catherine
                    McLaen New. This work made little impression either literarily or financially
                    but was an important step for the firm, which in 1895, upon the death of Bowen,
                    changed its official name to The Bobbs-Merrill Company. <hi rend="i">When

            <p>Sales figures are not available to determine the number of books sold or the
                    breadth of the field served by Bowen-Merrill during the 1880's. Much of
                    this sort of data was lost in the disastrous fire of 1890, in which the building
                    with nearly all its contents was destroyed.<hi rend="sup">244</hi> The company
                    had greatly expanded since the reorganization of 1885 and in 1890 carried an
                    extremely large stock of books. The firm occupied five floors in its building,
                    two of them used for their book-selling business, while the remaining three
                    floors were stocked with newsprint for sale to county weeklies. About fifty
                    people worked in the building, in addition to the salesmen who traveled over
                    three or four states supplying drug stores with stationery and school books.<hi rend="sup">245</hi>

                    stands, caught fire on the afternoon of March 17, 1890. In an effort to control
                    the flames, firemen had gone to the roof when, without warning, the building
                    collapsed, carrying twelve firemen to their death and injuring sixteen others.
                    The iron facade of the building was no doubt responsible for this tragedy. In
                    addition to the loss of life, nearly all the books and other supplies were

            <p>When the old state house was torn down in 1878, the State Library was faced with
                    the problem of finding a temporary home so that its collections might still
                    prove useful to patrons. The old capitol had been a museum as well as a library,
                    with its accumulation of war mementoes, prehistoric Indian weapons, and relics
                    of all sorts. Satisfactory quarters were found in the building on Market at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> (now Capitol Avenue). When the new state house was completed, the
                    library was moved to quarters in the south wing of the second floor, where it
                    remained until 1934. In 1883 it was said to comprise seventeen thousand
                        volumes.<hi rend="sup">247</hi> The library collection did not expand
                    rapidly because of the small annual appropriation for books; in 1888 only
                    $400 was available for books and repairs.<hi rend="sup">248</hi> Yet,
                    before the state house was quite finished, fears were expressed that the space
                    allotted to the library was entirely inadequate.<hi rend="sup">249</hi> No
                    satisfactory book catalog existed at the time, and much effort was expended by
                    the librarians during the decade in preparing one. The dictionary plan was
                    adopted as the most desirable, and work proceeded on that arrangement.<hi rend="sup">250</hi>

                    </placeName> Public Library in 1880 considered the various plans which had been
                    offered to alleviate this condition. It finally accepted the offer of the Alvord
                    property on the southwest corner of <placeName>

                    </placeName> streets, opposite the new Denison Hotel. A building was constructed
                    south of the old Alvord house and was connected directly with the original
                    building which fronted on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    $14,000, and a ten-year lease on the property was obtained at a
                    rental of $3,000 per annum. School offices and stacks were situated

                    was done during state fair week, and the library was formally opened about
                    October 1.<hi rend="sup">252</hi> During the first two weeks in the new location
                    circulation fell almost to zero, and the librarian was in despair, fearing the
                    new location was to blame. But as soon as the election was over and political
                    activity relaxed, patronage increased.<hi rend="sup">253</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Book circulation had dropped in 1880 slightly below the figures for 1879, and an
                    even greater decrease was evident in 1881. During the next two years circulation
                    increased, then dropped again in 1884 to 137,256, about 58,000 less than the
                    previous year. A slight gain was noted in 1885, and by 1886 the total almost
                    reached that for 1883. Thereafter a steady growth was observed until 1890, when
                    a considerable loss was again experienced. This smaller volume of circulation
                    continued through 1891 and 1892, but fluctuation occurred despite the constant
                    growth in the number of registration cards issued. Since it has been previously
                    suggested that book circulation figures and business prosperity proceed in
                    opposite directions, it might thus be presumed that the business recess of the
                    later 1880's was reflected directly in the sudden increase in 1886 of
                    the use of the library. It might also be suggested that the return of prosperity
                    affected the circulation, which dropped in 1890; but the librarian reported that
                    some books were withdrawn for reclassification in the years
                    1889–1891, a fact which might account for some decrease in that
                    period. It will be recalled, too, that the library had been founded in 1873, the
                    year of the panic.<hi rend="sup">254</hi>

            <p>Many books and periodicals were added to the collection in the 1880's,
                    including foreign publications. A catalog on the dictionary plan similar to that
                    being developed in the State Library was in process. The first issue was

                    On other similar occasions as many as fifty persons would be waiting. This time
                    the librarian was forced to issue a new rule that each patron could draw only

            <p>One of the most difficult problems in the study of the diocese of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> or of any religious history in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is the acquisition of objective, concrete facts about religious
                    activities. The divorce between government and religious institutions,
                    especially outside the thirteen original states, and the tendency to write
                    history from governmental sources has resulted in an underwriting and even an
                    ignoring of religious history in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Increasing the difficulties of the inquiry is the fact that when
                    religious history has been written it has generally been compiled in terms of
                    one or another denomination. Often, in the case of smaller religious bodies,
                    this history has not been compiled at all. The increased interest in social
                    history that followed the attempts of Frederick J. Turner, John B. McMaster, and
                    Vernon L. Parrington, to mention some important writers, to go beyond political
                    and military history has likewise increased interest in religious history. But
                    even though the census reports since the latter part of the nineteenth century
                    have included economic and social data, religious statistics have always been

            <p>Gabriel Le Bras,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> of the Sorbonne, has worked out a theory of
                    religious history which has added new meaning to French religious history.
                    Roughly, instead of tracing an external religious organization or arguing over
                    the dogmatic beliefs of certain regions or cities, Le Bras has endeavored to
                    work out a formula for an analysis of the religious activities of the French
                    people in any given period of their history and the social, political, and
                    economic factors affecting that activity. For <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> during most of her history this involves a study of the members of
                    one religious body, the Roman Catholic church. In fact, few religious activities
                    in the history of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> cannot be examined on the basis of their connection with or their
                    departure from Roman Catholicism. <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> is no longer a Roman Catholic country in the sense that it was in
                    medieval times, but even today <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> does not offer the complicated problem of a multitude of religious
                    organizations as does the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Le Bras method takes for its unit the French parish, which is a standard
                    geographical unit having as its center a parish church. Besides listing the
                    strictly religious activities of a parish, Le Bras attempts to ascertain the
                    effects of geographical, economic, and sociological factors on the religious
                    activities of the parish and in turn on the activities of the district and the
                    region. Thus he endeavors to secure information on the effects of the ethnic
                    character of the population, its mobility, its relations with other places and
                    peoples, and its relations with civic organizations, on the religious practices
                    at a given time and on their evolution through the history of the parish and
                    region. The application of this method to the study of an American region is
                    complicated by the many differences in tradition, but insofar as the emphasis is
                    on religious practices and non-religious factors, which are to be studied
                    independently of any propagandistic or apologetic purpose, the method can be
                    adopted.</p>

                    for a similar period. While there is mobility of population in modern <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, that mobility does not yet approach the population movement of the <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> where nearly everyone professes the same religious faith, these are
                    exceptions. Consequently the use of the religious parish district or diocese as
                    a unit of study can have only limited value. To apply the Le Bras method to the
                    region known as the Roman Catholic diocese of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, which will celebrate its centenary in 1957, the historian must
                    consider it a useful geographical unit but not a unit binding all forms of
                    religious activities. Nevertheless the eighteen counties in northern Indiana
                    which now comprise that diocese<hi rend="sup">4</hi> afford a desirable region
                    for such a study since they are inhabited by rural and urban, agricultural and
                    industrial, English and non-English people—nearly all the elements
                    that one would wish to see in this type of study.</p>
            <p>The Roman Catholics in the counties of the diocese number only 242,293 (1956) in

                    denomination. But even the study of Roman Catholicism of this region would be
                    incomplete if it did not include a comparison with the activities of other
                    religious groups and of those who belong to no religious denomination as well as
                    a survey of the non-religious factors that have influenced the religious life of

                    about religion in the area of the present diocese of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> is special history and has tended to be the history of clerical
                    organizations and of the religious institutions established by them. Such
                    histories are also usually limited to one denomination and its formal religious
                    activities. Generally speaking, the compilation of the special history of all
                    religious organizations in the diocese—Protestant, Catholic, and
                    Jewish — should precede any attempt to study the effects of
                    environmental factors. But the data must be compiled in as objective a manner as
                    possible independently of any propagandistic value in the statistics. In
                    acquiring these statistics the researcher must keep in mind that religious
                    motives have been a factor in population movements, since nearness to a church
                    or pastor was frequently important in the choice of a farm site or community,
                    especially in the case of immigrants seeking to settle in the new country near
                    others who spoke their same language and practiced their same religion.</p>
            <p>Most American population movements were not primarily religiously motivated. In
                    the so-called westward migration the physical geography that determined the
                    lines of communication necessarily affected the movements of the people who
                    built them and those who used them, and hence had indirect influence on the
                    religious life of the people. The prehistory<hi rend="sup">6</hi> of the
                    migration of the Indians of the Great Lakes region has little direct bearing on
                    the present religious history of the Americans of the northern counties of
                    Indiana, except that the first white missionaries and fur traders came to

                    farmers began to settle the region they tended to follow the same water routes
                    and trails. Furtrading centers became the early villages, and the river valleys
                    with their fertile soil naturally attracted the early farmers. Water power of

                    development of the iron and steel industries of the Calumet area. The general
                    levelness of northern Indiana which made overland travel, even off the beaten
                    trails, not too difficult aided in the migration of families in the
                    1830's and 1840's from southern Indiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and certain southern states into the northern counties. This
                    levelness was more important in the railroad era because railroad lines could be
                    constructed to cross the state almost directly to the new trade centers at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Canal workers, mostly Irish immigrants, and railroad workers came
                    to northern Indiana during the building of these trade routes and some stayed to
                    operate them. Many of these workers bought farms along the way, and other
                    pioneers soon came to take advantage of these new means of transportation.</p>
            <p>The early pioneers and the later settlers accepted little from the new region
                    except the natural resources and the freedom offered by the frontier. They
                    brought with them most <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-052-4-060"/> of their political,
                    social, and religious institutions, some of which were modified in the
                    adjustment to frontier life. For the religious historian the most important fact
                    in the history of the Northwest Territory was liberty, that disestablishment of
                    religion by law which distinguishes America from nearly every other Western
                    nation. This meant, of course, that there would be no state aid to missionaries,
                    church organizations, or denominational schools. On the other hand, it gave to
                    the pioneers themselves and to residents of older communities the obligation to
                    provide all the externals of religion. Equally important, however, for religious
                    groups was the constitutional protection of property and freedom of the press.
                    Each religious organization was free to acquire property for churches and
                    schools and to print and distribute literature propagating its special
                    doctrines. Even in times of stress, such as during the days of the Know Nothing
                    movement, the rise of the American Protective Association, and the heyday of the
                    Ku Klux Klan, these two freedoms, while they could not hinder social ostracism
                    and economic pressure, made it possible for minority religious groups to live
                    and to grow. Later tax exemptions and state subsidy to charitable institutions
                    which handled public charges have aided the growth of some religious
                    institutions. Religious organizations which have provided denominational schools
                    for their own children have done so at their own expense.</p>
            <p>There have been no strictly religious parties in Indiana politics and when
                    religious prejudice has crept into the political battles it has come from social
                    pressures rather than from the law. In this sense social forces have been even
                    more important than the political element in the religious history of northern
                    Indiana. Probably the most important social factor in the religious organization

                    of the mother churches to care for them. These tendencies are also true of the
                    religious activities of the later Negro immigrants to the region. Also important
                    were the previous religious fervor and the circumstances surrounding the
                    migration. The Irish joined in the construction of new canals and railroads
                    because they were for the most part unskilled workers and poor. Few of the early
                    Irish became farmers. Many of the German immigrants, however, had the means to
                    buy farm land. The Poles began in the region as marginal farmers but later
                    arrivals became a factory population. Most of the later immigrant groups of the
                    northeastern part of Indiana came directly as mill workers. To become an
                    independent farmer the migrant had to have previous farming experience and the
                    means to buy and exploit the fertile land. Capital was even more necessary to
                    open a store or start a factory.</p>
            <p>It has been noted that the Irish workers on the canals and railroads frequently
                    did not bring with them their womenfolk. This condition undoubtedly contributed
                    to the roughness of life in the workers' camps. The pioneer from the
                    older established regions tended to move west with his entire family and the
                    presence of children brought along the problems of education and schools. John
                    D. Barnhart has called attention to the average youthfulness of the early
                        pioneer.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> In many cases the husband came alone until he
                    could afford to return for his family. On the frontier the women tended to be
                    more faithful to religious practice than men. The farmer adjusted easily to
                    family life and to the social life of the rural church, the later urban worker
                    less so. An unexplored factor in religious growth that is recognized is the
                    failure of the American Irish to reproduce themselves, <list type="footnotes">

                    indoctrination has been strengthened by the religious parish school or by the
                    Sunday school. In more recent decades the breakdown of this compact religious
                    life in the change from the rural home to the urban apartment and the heavily
                    populated neighborhood<hi rend="sup">11</hi> has been noted but not evaluated.</p>
            <p>Class distinctions were not too important in the history of the Middle West.
                    Hoosiers have had no hereditary nobles. Indiana people have in general been
                    lower middle or just plain lower class, but wealth and the social attainments of
                    wealth have been the dividing lines more than some social historians like to
                    admit. The Hoosier novelists are better witnesses here. Also, the desire to be a
                    member of the religious group dominant in any community has been a significant
                    factor in changes in denomination—but a factor hard to measure. It is
                    sometimes complicated with the desire to get away from foreign language groups
                    and peasant origins. More important for the maintenance of religious practices
                    were the organizations in which the people concentrated their social activities.
                    In the nineteenth century these societies, especially among foreign language
                    groups, were probably more vital because other amusements were lacking. While
                    political parties have had little influence on religion because of the
                    separation of church and state, it is also true that religious faith was an
                    important factor in elections and in social standing. The ratio of English to
                    non-English and Protestant to Catholic varies noticeably between the eastern and
                    western counties of the diocese. Prejudices against Germans in the two World
                    Wars was scarcely perceptible. Anti-semitism has not been pronounced except as
                    an element in the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920's. Where the immigrants of
                    any national group in any locality were of one religious denomination and banded
                    together for political favor, politics could be said to be intermingled with
                    religious history.</p>

                    movements. Within the diocese there are no differences of mountains and plain;
                    the chief distinction is between urban and rural. In some rural communities and
                    in factory towns certain non-English immigrants have established colonies, but
                    immigrants seldom have the dominant roles in the large communities.</p>

                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> diocese there are a few rural communities in which a common
                    religious faith among nearly all the inhabitants has made the parish or the
                    church an important social as well as religious center. This has been
                    particularly true of the Catholic foreign language groups for whom the parish
                    hall has been the headquarters of most societies and social functions. It has
                    also been true in the Mennonite communities and in certain other Protestant
                    communities. The urban community and the industrialized regions in the
                    northwestern part of the state present quite a different picture from the
                    eastern area. Where large groups of one or another nationality congregated in a
                    region, church unity has been pronounced. As the language barrier has been
                    increasingly overcome, many in these groups have tended to mix with other groups
                    and intermarry, and gradually the old-world rural village idea with the village
                    church as its center has tended to disappear. In recent years the growth of
                    church membership, complicated by the breakdown of church social control over
                    its members, has been recognized as accompanying urbanization and
                    industrialization. Important factors in these religious modifications have been
                    the improvement in education and the attempt to educate for urban life.</p>
            <p>Individual circumstances and opportunity have also influenced religious history.
                    The circumstance of a man's birth is important because the child tends
                    to embrace the religion of his parents. Furthermore education in a religious
                    atmosphere, whether in a religious community or a religious school, is bound to
                    have its effect on the individual. So also the elimination of religious
                    influences in education is bound to have its effect. School consolidation, the
                    increase in high school and college attendance—all these affect the
                    religious life of the community and the individual. Local customs are
                    undoubtedly more important in the rural village than in the <pb n="378" id="VAA4025-052-4-064"/> city, but the compactness of city life also makes
                    for greater uniformity in habits. The choice of livelihood after leaving the
                    parental home is also an important personal factor.</p>
            <p>Another social factor that varies from time to time is the moral or religious
                    tone of a period. Historians note periods of religious revival and decline. Thus
                    the "Victorian Era" refers not just to the years in which
                    Victoria ruled <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> but to a certain complex of moral attitudes which governed the
                    social life of the country. Again, Spencerian sociology and Darwinism have
                    affected religious life,<hi rend="sup">12</hi> at least among those who have
                    received a higher education. So also theological "modernism"
                    affected the religious life of the American people through the acceptance or
                    rejection of "modernism" by the clergy. The recent return to
                    religion shown by greatly increased church membership must be considered a group
                    phenomenon yet it has an effect on the individual.</p>
            <p>In closely organized groups like the Roman Catholics changes in church
                    regulations, for example those which brought about the more frequent reception
                    of the Eucharist and the advocacy of lay movements such as Catholic Action, have
                    had considerable influence though with local variations. Among Protestants
                    evangelists and social-religious organizations have been important. Some
                    churches lay greater stress on revivalism than do others. Modern media of
                    communication, improved living conditions, and new amusements have also affected
                    the religious life of individuals in many ways.</p>
            <p>To apply all of these factors to the religious history of the <placeName>

                    limit his study by recognizing the limitations of his sources and by endeavoring
                    to attain the more likely goals. He must first gather all available religious
                    statistics. Much information must be gathered for the first time. He must study
                    the census reports for useful social and economic data. He must search local
                    histories, biographical accounts, and records of local depositories. The
                    material which he finds will fall chiefly into two categories: <list type="footnotes">

                    join the nearest available church, frequently Methodist, Baptist, or
                    Presbyterian.</p>
            <p>During this period the number of Catholic clergy increased chiefly by arrivals
                    from Europe and the number of Protestant clergy by arrivals chiefly from the
                    east and south. Long before the Civil War formal religious organizations were
                    supervising the spiritual life of the people of northern Indiana. One important
                    factor which delayed the population movements of northern Indiana was the
                    swampland area in the northwestern part of the state. This area, which has since
                    become rich and productive, the less fertile lands in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> valley, and the lack of mineral resources all played their part in
                    making northwestern Indiana a section different from central and southern
                    Indiana. With the growth of industry a change is also noticeable in the people
                    of the region. At first the immigrants were chiefly from the middle and eastern
                    states and almost none were from Europe. Recent studies of the origins of the

                    acceptable closing time for the era of migrations would be the beginning of
                    World War I. As a whole this period witnessed the growth of innumerable towns in
                    Indiana, many of which failed in their dreams of becoming large municipalities.
                    This is a period of religious expansion in which churches were built and
                    parishes and congregations multiplied and in which religious practice was taken
                    as a badge of civic respectability. Despite recurring depressions, bank
                    failures, and other financial problems, optimism was constant,<hi rend="sup">18</hi> reaching its climax perhaps in the Progressive Era in which even
                    Hoosiers such as Albert J. Beveridge began to think of world conquests.</p>
            <p>During this period foreign immigrants arrived in great numbers to work in the
                    established industries, in the new factories, and in the later steel mills.
                    Foreign groups speaking a common language were for the most part enclaves in the
                    larger population and in many cases the church was the social as well as the
                    religious center of such a group. Outside of the major religious organizations
                    there seems to have been a shuffling of religious memberships and a gradual
                    decline in religious practices among people who spent their days in factories
                    and mills. Roughly, though, at the turn of the century, most of the population
                    could be classified into the religious groups to which they belonged when they
                    came into the region, whether they were active or only nominal members.</p>
            <p>The movement from the farm to the city increased in momentum, for the wages of
                    farm help could not compete with the higher industrial wages. Some Indiana
                    industries merely moved to the larger cities or other areas, though many small
                    town industries remained. Some industries grew into towering corporations while
                    other smaller factories closed their doors. The founding of the steel mills of
                    Gary and vicinity was perhaps the most important factor in the population
                    movements of the recent decades. Railroads encountered stiff competition from
                    automobiles, trucks, and paved roads and the means of communication increasingly
                    improved. Perhaps no section of Indiana underwent these changes more completely
                    or more rapidly than the northwestern parts.</p>

            <p>The continued industrialization and urbanization had important repercussions on
                    the religious life of the people. The churches tried to follow their people, to
                    care for the children deprived of the comparative security of farm life, to
                    provide a social life for the people whose homes were apartments and whose
                    education was limited. Language barriers began to break down, rural customs
                    brought over from Europe disappeared, greater wealth brought new standards of
                    living. After World War I it can be said in one sense that the population of
                    Indiana began to settle down, for movement to the West had tapered off, but in
                    another sense the movement to the cities created a new mobility. Church
                    buildings increased but whether the churches have been able to keep pace with a
                    mobile population and the latest diversions, such as television, is open to
                    question. To determine these factors is the chief problem facing the historian
                    who tries to follow religious trends into the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>In studying the history of religion in the eighteen counties constituting the
                    present diocese of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> the historian will have to remember certain special factors. In the
                    first place, the state and the diocese are only artificial divisions, with
                    little foundation in geographical lines. This artificiality was emphasized in
                    the building of the railroads and their impact on the region. The existence of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a market and a railroad center further de-emphasizes the local
                    geographical factors; but the concentration on steel manufactures at lake ports
                    near Gary has a geographical basis. Finally, financial concentration and the
                    means of communication which created the metropolitan center of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> determined in many ways the development of the northwestern
                    counties of Indiana. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> has in a way its own story as a center of trade and population. The
                    northeastern counties and most counties in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> valley are mainly agricultural regions.</p>
            <p>The facts that can be garnered seem almost endless, but order can be induced into
                    them. History is representative by nature and is never adequate. The Le Bras
                    method, while needing adaptation to the Indiana setting, can give the historian
                    who is careful in collecting and fitting together his facts an acceptable story
                    of religion in the diocese of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. That it will glorify religion or indicate at least a partial
                    failure is not the concern of this type of history because religion has a value
                    independent of its acceptance or rejection by the people.</p>

                    <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-052-4-070"/> 1782, he wrote a letter, probably to Lord
                    Shelburne, explaining his direction of Indian warfare and the reasons for the
                    failure of his campaign against Clark. In the meantime Lord Cornwallis had
                    surrendered, Lord North had resigned, and the Marquis of Rockingham had formed a
                    new cabinet in which Lord Shelburne had become Secretary of State in charge of
                    the colonies. The letter was followed by Hamilton's appointment as
                    Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. Largely because the details which he had given in
                    his "Report" are omitted and the letter directed particularly
                    to explaining his conduct of Indian warfare and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> campaign, it takes on the character of self-defense. Towards the
                    end of the letter, his description of his harsh treatment by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> is almost a plea for sympathy. That this letter should remain
                    unpublished seems to deny him the right to be heard in his own defense.</p>

                    </placeName> is placed in a more favorable light by this letter. In it he
                    mentions that the Indians had applied to him for permission to make war upon the
                    western border as soon as he arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He refused this request because of lack of authority, but on June
                    16, 1777, he received an order from Lord George Germain, the Secretary of State
                    in charge of the colonies, to send the Indians under white leaders to attack the
                    frontiers. He also described his instructions to the participants in the
                    expeditions before they left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. "No party was sent out without one or more white persons,
                    who had orders and instructions in writing to attend to the behaviour of the
                    Indians, protect defenceless persons and prevent any insult or barbarity being
                    exercised on the Prisoners. … I constantly addressed the Indians
                    pointing out to them the advantage which must in future result to them, from
                    sparing the lives of their prisoners." At least one instance of good
                    treatment for which there is corroborating evidence was cited. Moreover, the 350
                    Indians who accompanied him on his expedition treated the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> very well although they could have been quite cruel.</p>
            <p>Although Hamilton did not mention it in this letter, the Indians were of no help

                    It attributes to the French the sending of information to Clark, the concealment
                    of powder which was afterwards delivered to Clark and used by him, and finally
                    of fighting with "the rebels" when the fort was attacked. He
                    mentions the defection of the French militia in the fort when Clark demanded its
                    surrender, a defection which reduced Hamilton's force to thirty men.</p>
            <p>This manuscript may help in evaluating Governor Hamilton, for it indicates that
                    he was not only opposed to a daring and brilliant young Virginian but that he
                    had placed dependence upon a body of Indians who failed him at the crucial point
                    and upon French villagers who had not forgotten their mother country and who
                    only waited an opportunity to square accounts with the English who had conquered

                    </placeName>. The Franco-American Alliance, which Clark but not Hamilton knew
                    about, was a most influential force in the West. However much
                    Hamilton's direction of Indian warfare may be regretted, the honesty of
                    his writings forces us to recognize that he earnestly endeavored to lessen the
                    cruelty of the warriors.</p>

                        <p>Before any parties were sent out, I constantly addressed the
                                    Indians pointing out to them the advantages which must in future
                                    result to them, from sparing the lives of their prisoners, who
                                    whenever a peace should take place would testify to their
                                    humanity and be successfull mediators between the Americans and

                                    had with these people, the personal knowledge I had gained of
                                    their chiefs and principal speakers, and the influence which the
                                    liberality of government gave me with them, effected that change
                                    in their manner of carrying on an Indian war, which was rather
                                    to be wished than expected.</p>

                                    cruelties, might justly be suspected of wanting truth for its
                                    support, but the notoriety of the following circumstances may
                                    acquit me to the Public and relieve me from the load of odium

                                            which I declined with many thanks, adding that I never

                                            routes are also much longer than direct land routes. His

                                    much longer, and lastly the level country we had to pass was

                                    of conveying information to the Rebels at the Ilinois, in spight

                                    were in hopes to have an enquiry or public hearing when we might
                                    have an opportunity of exculpating ourselves, but such an
                                    attention to our situation we looked for in vain.</p>
                        <p>It was now Sunset, we were wet, fatigued, and disspirited, and
                                    after standing a considerable tune the gaze of the populace we
                                    were sent to the common Jail a mile distance.</p>
                        <p>We were then put in a dungeon, where we found another of our
                                    companions in Irons and five felons—</p>
                        <p>This cell was not ten feet Square, and here we were to accomodate
                                    ourselves as well as we could, without a blankett or even
                                    palleasse.</p>
                        <p>The next day, we were brought into the yard, where our handcuffs
                                    were exchanged for fetters, mine weighed 18 lb and
                                    half—</p>
                        <p>We were not allowed candle, nor the use of Pen and paper without
                                    the permission of our Jailor,<hi rend="sup">19</hi> neither
                                    might we on any other terms speak to a living soul.</p>

                        <p>After having remained in irons 40 days &amp; seeing that no
                                    thought seemed to be bestowed on us, I prevailed on the Jailor
                                    to take a letter to the Lieutenant Governor in which I
                                    represented the miserable state of my companions and
                                    representing that it was hard to punish them for obedience to
                                    the orders of their superior, that if there was any criminality
                                    in the orders given, I ought to suffer alone—No
                                    answer was ever received—</p>
                        <p>In the Month of October a parole was tenderd to us, which was so
                                    artfully worded, we unanimously agreed to remain prisoners
                                    rather than accept it.</p>
                        <p>I remained in this Prison fourteen Months, under the varied
                                    tyranny of unfeeling men, sometimes allowed to purchase
                                    necessaries with money which General Philips had kindly procured
                                    for us, sometimes reduced to the prison ration with cold water,
                                    in the depth of the coldest season ever experienced in that part
                                    of America—We were obliged to keep in the blanketts
                                    furnished us by the Jailor and the remnants of our own bedding
                                    which after some time were sent us, day as well as night, at
                                    length our Jailor took upon him to take us to another room in
                                    the Prison where we could have a fire—</p>
                        <p>The Gout laying hold of me while the Snow was yet on the ground,
                                    by the representation of a Surgeon, my irons were taken
                                    off—</p>
                        <p>The Summer following we were transferrd to another Prison where
                                    we remained till October, when a second parole was tenderd,
                                    &amp; a third which last at the instance of friends at <placeName>

                        <p>As one proof of what we might have expected from the people who
                                    had us in their power, I shall mention the case of Mr.
                                    Maisonville one of the prioners.</p>
                        <p>This was the person whom I had sent from St <placeName>

                                    man a relation, and delivered into the hands of Colonel Clarke,
                                    who orderd one of his people to take off his scalp, the man
                                    hesitating, he was threatened with violent imprecations, and had
                                    proceeded so far as to take off a small part when the Colonel
                                    thought proper to stop him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Maisonville who was a most resolute man made no resistance
                                    &amp; on every occasion had behaved with resolution <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-052-4-081"/> and firmness, but a years
                                    close confinement with some apprehension of ending his days at
                                    the gallows had such an effect on his spirits, as tended to
                                    unsettle his brain, the person who had attended on us and given
                                    us his assistance and medicines, was so kind as to write to
                                    Governor Jefferson an account of this poor man's
                                    situation, stating that free air and liberty were essential to
                                    his recovery before any answer arrived the unhappy creature
                                    eluded the vigilance of every one and with a razor which he
                                    snatched from a servant put a period to his life and miseries at
                                        once.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> In consequence of having
                                    accepted a Parole we were permitted to pass to <placeName>

                                    twice in imminent danger of perishing, there not being so much
                                    as a Log line on board.</p>
                        <p>The final exchange of myself with Major Hay took place on the 4th

                                    enterprize, in which I hope it will appear, that I failed
                                    thro' the treachery of a set of wretches, who owed
                                    their lives and wellbeing to our humanity, and management of a
                                    ferocious people, who at a nod would have destroyed them and

                        <p>The mortification of surrendering to such a set of Banditti, was
                                    heightened by the reflection that we were renderd encapable of
                                    being serviceable for so long a time—</p>

            <p>The titles of the various works printed in Indiana and listed in this
                    bibliography give a picture of a developing society in a pioneer state. The
                    first titles listed concern the laws of Indiana Territory; the first personal
                    item is a speech by William Henry Harrison, its governor; the first
                    non-political publication was produced by the Baptists in 1813; a new town was
                    advertised in 1816; while a group of the stockholders of the Bank of <placeName>

                    economic activity; a medical society had been formed by 1820; the Friends began
                    to rival the Baptists in printing their records; and the Harmony Society in 1824

            <p>Although of interest to many persons, a work of this kind is of special concern
                    to historians and to librarians. Since modern historians obtain most of their
                    information from manuscript and printed sources, guides to the sources are
                    particularly helpful to them. The Indiana Historical Bureau has done a great
                    service to historians, librarians, and the public by publishing this
                    bibliography of material printed in Indiana from 1804 to 1853. Cecil K. Byrd and
                    Howard H. Peckham were the compilers.</p>

            <p>Many interesting things can be learned from a study of this volume. Twenty-two
                    per cent of the items listed were published by the Baptist church. This record
                    of getting its activity in print is nothing short of amazing, in part because it
                    was almost double the publishing activities of the territorial and state
                    governments. The Indiana State Library and the Indiana Historical Society
                    library, located in the same building, constitute much the best research center
                    for this type of material, for together they possess over sixty per cent of the
                    titles found. The library of Indiana University in contrast has less than
                    twenty-five per cent. Other libraries have even less. Considerable duplication
                    exists between the State Library and the Historical Society library. The chief
                    strength of the State Library is in its possession of state publications; its
                    most obvious weakness is the lack of material published by the Baptist church.
                    These characteristics are also true of the University library. Both, on the
                    other hand, have extensive collections of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> material.</p>
            <p>In preparing this bibliography, the compilers have made certain decisions, some
                    of which conform to previous practice and some of which constitute deviations.
                    Magazines and newspapers have been excluded as in the past because they
                    constitute a class of material in themselves. On the other hand, broadsides and
                    sheet music have been included although they have been omitted by previous
                    Indiana lists of this character. With these decisions no objection need be
                    taken. The omission of the printed documents found in the Documentary Journals
                    of the state government is another matter. Indiana's peculiar procedure
                    in this matter is not well understood and the failure to include them either
                    collectively or individually may lead researchers to miss them altogether. These
                    documents are imprints, and as important or more important than other matter
                    included, and yet the only reference to them is in the introduction to the
                    volume. Rather than follow the policy of omission, a shorter time period might
                    have been covered if it were necessary to keep down the expense. The compilers,
                    however, have found and listed many titles not previously known and have
                    produced a work of great usefulness and excellence, and for it they are to be
                    commended.</p>

            <p>These volumes have been prepared as bibliographical tools for persons interested
                    in historical research. As general editor of the project, Professor Clark has
                    supplied an editorial preface for each volume and has been responsible for
                    co-ordinating the efforts of those who compiled the various sections within each
                    volume. Volume I consists of three sections: Alfred B. Thomas, "Spanish
                    Travel in the South, 1527–1750"; Hugh T. Lefler
                    "The Southern Colonies, 1600–1750"; and Lester J.
                    Cappon "The South During Two Wars, 1750–1783."
                    Volume II has four sections: John D. Barnhart, "The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley Frontier, 1750–1825"; William B.
                    Hamilton, "The Post Revolutionary War South,
                    1783–1805"; Walter B. Posey "The Lower Southern
                    Frontier, 1806–1815"; and Culver H. Smith "The
                    South in Expansion, 1816–1825."</p>
            <p>Entries within each section appear alphabetically under the author's
                    name. In addition to title, publisher, place and date of publication, and number
                    of pages, the compilers have included the measurement and location of the copy
                    of the particular edition examined, the inclusive dates of the material
                    presented by the author, and a list of other editions of the printed work. Each
                    item has been appraised for its general worth. This has meant, on the whole, the
                    presentation of brief, pertinent facts about the author's background,
                    some comment on his approach and bias, and a listing of topics and geographical
                    areas treated by him. The indices include both name and subject-matter
                    categories.</p>
            <p>Much time and effort have gone into the production of the two volumes and they
                    will greatly facilitate the work of scholars engaged in historical research.
                    Moreover, the editorial prefaces and the introductory comments by compilers of
                    the various sections suggest trends and emphases which stand out in the
                    bibliographical items listed. Users of individual items will thus have a clearer
                    comprehension of the uniqueness of the material with which they are dealing.
                    Additional volumes have been planned and the completed set <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-052-4-088"/> will undoubtedly constitute a major bibliographical
                    tool for years to come.</p>
            <p>Like all bibliographical ventures, this project involves problems of organization
                    and inclusion which can never be resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned.
                    Travelers generally ignored sectional lines. Should they be included in a
                    bibliography centering on the South if their major travels were outside that
                    area? The compilers have been generous in the matter, perhaps overly so. Why,
                    for instance, include George Clarke when the compiler takes pains to say that
                    the only reference in the volume to the Southern colonies is the last
                    sentence—"and the 7th of July we came to an anchor in <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi>" (I, 66).</p>
            <p>A satisfactory definition of the term "travel account"
                    constitutes a still greater problem. Again the compilers have been generous.
                    They have included material tucked away in biographies and memoirs, and
                    secondhand accounts written primarily from the material of others. Since they
                    found it difficult to distinguish between strictly travel accounts and other
                    items which related "directly" to travel and description, they
                    included geographies, atlases, surveys, and the statistical reports. Under their
                    definition it seems to me that they should have listed <hi rend="i">American
                        Husbandry</hi> in addition to Jefferson's <hi rend="i">Notes on <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName>.</hi> If George Croghan deserves mention, why not also Conrad
                    Weiser and John Stuart? Some of their writings appear in published accounts. The
                    items by Edmund Burke and Arthur Young, to cite examples, seem incongruous in a
                    bibliography devoted to travel accounts. Greater unity and perhaps greater
                    usefulness might have resulted from eliminating works not written directly by
                    travelers and by substituting actual travel accounts which have appeared in
                    magazines or which still remain in manuscript form in major depositories.</p>
            <p>Volumes still to come can be made more useful by cross references wherever works
                    by the same author appear in separate volumes as, for example, references to
                    George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to Robert Rogers in both Volumes I and II. Care should be taken
                    to hunt out English translations of works published in a foreign language. The
                    German edition of Gottfried Duden's book, for instance, has been
                    translated and published in large part in the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

                        </placeName> Historical Review.</hi> When an author published under a
                    pseudonym—for example, <pb n="403" id="VAA4025-052-4-089"/> Henry
                    Knight under the name Arthur Singleton—both names should appear in
                    the index. The first volume in this bibliographical series by E. M. Coulter, <hi rend="i">Travels in the Confederate States</hi>, appeared in 1948 but
                    without a volume number. Coulter did not give the location of the edition
                    examined, as has been done in the current two volumes. The indexing in his
                    volume also varies considerably from that used in the current volumes. Greater
                    uniformity throughout the series would add to convenience in using.</p>
            <p>Greater care should be exercised in indexing and in spelling of names. In Volume
                    II, for example, only one item is listed under "democracy" in
                    the index, although analysis of books included by the compilers shows that
                    several more index references should have been given. Examples of variations in
                    spelling of names are: Ramsay and Ramsey; Baily and Bailey; Sutcliff and
                    Sutcliffe; Vieillot and Viellot; Hartridge and Hartbridge; Abbot and Abbott.</p>

                    </placeName> to the historian of American territorial government. Historical
                    interest is often attracted to the sensational; yet it is in the unobtrusive
                    functioning of territories like <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> that the operation and development of America's
                    "colonial" system can best be studied. This volume, in which
                    Dr. White has undertaken the noteworthy task of identifying and <pb n="404" id="VAA4025-052-4-090"/> analyzing the published sources on territorial <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, will prove a valuable aid not only to students of <placeName>

                    </placeName> history but also to those scholars who have concerned themselves
                    with a study of territorial government in general.</p>
            <p>Dr. White, librarian of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> State Historical Society, has divided his sources into five
                    categories: major contemporary sources; minor sources, differing from the major
                    sources only because they give less information about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> Territory; additional sources, chiefly reminiscences or
                    recollections recorded many years after the events described; and territorial
                    newspapers and maps of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> Territory. A very brief appendix contains a discussion of certain
                    sources on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>'s pre-territorial history. The bibliography is carefully
                    and critically annotated and appears to be exhaustive in its coverage. The index
                    is thorough, a valuable guide to the sources discussed in the body of the book.
                    Although White at the outset limits his study to published sources, some mention
                    of the important collections of manuscript and archival material dealing with
                    territorial <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> might have been included for the benefit of the scholar whose
                    research would carry him beyond the published works.</p>
            <p>White's first two chapters are intended as an introduction to the
                    published sources, the "essay" of the title. His statements,
                    however, are directed to the librarian rather than to the historian. There is no
                    comment on the nature of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>'s territorial government, no summary of the period which
                    the author has chosen as his field of concentration. Little attempt has been
                    made to place the bibliography in its historical perspective. The
                    author's tendency to depart from a discussion of the source material he
                    has compiled detracts from the value of these first chapters. For example, his
                    comments on commercially compiled reminiscences seem at times to have little
                    relevance to the period of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> history under study. His discussion of library policies in
                    preserving source materials and his appeal for a sound acquisitions policy for
                    the future do not enlighten the reader as to the problems involved in a study of
                    territorial <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> nor even as to the significance of the bibliography in directing
                    the serious scholar into hitherto neglected phases of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> history.</p>
            <pb n="405" id="VAA4025-052-4-091"/>
            <p>In his compilation of these published sources Dr. White has rendered the
                    historian a valuable and important service. It is hoped that the appearance of
                    this volume will not only stimulate study of territorial <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> and territorial government in its broader perspective but will also
                    encourage scholars in other states to produce similar bibliographies dealing
                    with their territorial periods.</p>

            <p>This volume, apparently the first regional geography of the Midwest, emphasizes
                    the economic development of the region during recent years. Though the area
                    covered is not precisely delimited, it is roughly that vast expanse of territory
                    from western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> westward to approximately the ninety-eighth parallel, stretching
                    from near the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> boundary on the south northward across the Great Lakes to include a
                    small portion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> immediately bordering the lakes.</p>
            <p>The first chapter sets forth the thesis that "The Midwest, the heart of
                    the North American continent, is a geographical phenomenon. The interior of no
                    other continent possesses a combination of natural resources so favorable to
                    human utilization" (p. 3). But the opening statement of the Preface
                    that "only within the present century has the significance of the
                    Midwest become apparent" (p. vii) underestimates the recognition given
                    to this region during the nineteenth century. For instance, James Hall in his
                        <hi rend="i">Notes on the Western States</hi> … ( <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> , 1838) wrote: "There is probably not on the globe, an
                    equal expanse of surface, of such uniform fertility; and when in addition to
                    that advantage, we take into view, its temperate climate, its salubrity, the
                    abundance of its mineral resources, the variety of its productions, the
                    multiplicity and extent of its navigable communications, and its central
                    position in relation to our continent, it will be conceded that there is none
                    which better deserves to be described and studied" (pp.
                    13–14).</p>
            <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-052-4-092"/>
            <p>This lack of basic information about the historical development of the region is
                    one of the weaknesses of this volume which is a co-operative work of fifteen
                    authors most of whom are professors of geography in institutions of the Midwest.
                    The initial chapter gives a preview of the region and its setting in
                    "The Heart of a Continent." Successive chapters discuss the
                    region with regard to "Weather and Climate,"
                    "Settlement Forms and Patterns," "Significance of
                    Agriculture," "Structure of Industry," and
                    "Trade and Transportation." Then follow separate chapters for
                    each of ten sub-regions, including four of the inner portions and six on the
                    peripheral portions of the Midwest. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> is described as the hub of the region. These chapters concerning
                    the sub-regions vary greatly in emphasis, value, and workmanship. Moreover, they
                    repeat much that is also found in the first six chapters, but considerable
                    repitition was perhaps unavoidable.</p>
            <p>The selected bibliography lists items of value which historians often overlook,
                    but there is a noticeable dearth of works appearing after 1950 despite the fact
                    that the volume was not published until 1955. Footnotes frequently add brief
                    information or data which should either have been included in the text or else
                    omitted, while supporting citations for much of the text and most of the tables
                    are either lacking or, if given, are not included in a manner which can be
                    easily identified or traced. A summary listing of the numerous tables and maps
                    would have been helpful as an addendum to the table of contents.</p>
            <p>Here and there are statements which may draw fire from scholars. For instance,
                    neither the view that "today, in the core of the continent at the very
                    center of the nation, is a distinctive Midwestern culture" (p. 14) nor
                    the inclusion of the region as a part of the Bible Belt (p. 12) is likely to
                    find general acceptance. Moreover, while midwesterners have become accustomed to
                    the isolationist label (p. 12) they have somehow done remarkably well in
                    supporting the nation in both civil and national wars, and this label needs
                    reexamination and further study rather than the loose bandying about which it
                    too often receives.</p>
            <p>This book suggests anew the mutual kinship between geography and history and the
                    impossibility of writing either effectively without giving careful attention to
                    the <pb n="407" id="VAA4025-052-4-093"/> other. Moreover, the Midwest certainly
                    merits such studies which can be used to advantage, particularly by students of
                    geography, history, economics, business, government, sociology, and other
                    subjects. The authors had the difficult task of covering immense topics within
                    short compass and their work was doubtless made more difficult by the lack of
                    previous similar studies of the Midwest.</p>

            <p>At first blush the reader of this monumental work is likely to be staggered by
                    its sheer volume. Yet as one reads he begins to wonder how so much of American
                    business history could have been compressed into so few pages. Commissioned by
                    the American Life Convention to write its history with the assistance of a
                    committee composed of past presidents of the Convention, Professor Buley has
                    surpassed what might have been expected even of one having his skill and
                    experience. For this book, consisting of some fourteen hundred pages, is
                    monumental not only in bulk but also in the interpretive insight demonstrated by
                    the author. As one reads, he finds it hard to imagine that the writer has not
                    spent a lifetime in the higher echelons of life insurance management. Yet the
                    perspective is clearly that of the historian rather than that of the business
                    man.</p>
            <p>While the book does not purport to be a history of life insurance in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, it comes very close to being just that. Spanning as it has the
                    last fifty years, the American Life Convention has seen life insurance in this
                    country grow from adolescence into vigorous maturity. Even more important, the
                    Convention has played an ever-growing role in shaping its development. The
                    American Life Convention has been part and parcel of the institution as it has
                    come into its own as a vital force in individual and business financial
                    planning, on the one hand, and a significant channel for the mobilization and
                    investment of savings on the other. Starting at a time when the Armstrong
                    investigation in New <pb n="408" id="VAA4025-052-4-094"/> York was causing the
                    country to turn critical eyes upon life insurance, the Convention has played a
                    more and more vital role in steering the institution of life insurance through
                    many critical periods. Such periods include two major wars, the financial crisis
                    and ensuing depression of the thirties, the investigations of the Temporary
                    National Economic Committee, and the Supreme Court decision declaring insurance
                    to be interstate commerce and hence subject to federal rather than state
                    control.</p>
            <p>Sponsored originally by the newer companies of the West and South—most
                    of them stock companies—the American Life Convention in the beginning
                    was largely a defensive organization. It spoke out for the preliminary term
                    method of policy valuation (which permitted the company to recover a substantial
                    proportion of the initial expense of issuing a policy from the first annual
                    premium rather than amortizing its recovery over a period of years), and in
                    favor of state as opposed to federal supervision then favored by some of the
                    eastern companies. But as time passed the organization began to outgrow its
                    sectionalism. One by one the companies of the eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> joined its ranks. By the early 1940's, with the accession
                    of most of the remaining large eastern companies, the American Life Convention
                    came to represent all but a fraction of the total life insurance in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. At the same time, the organization was fulfilling the dream of an
                    early secretary who had mothered it through infancy and adolescence, who
                    conceived as the Convention's ultimate function to "accumulate
                    facts, disseminate information, further education, abolish abuses, eliminate
                    unsound competition, adjust controversies, establish goodwill, promote
                    confidence, expose frauds, safeguard investments, prevent venal misguided
                    legislation, and protect policy holders" (pp. xiv-xv). Typical of the
                    Convention's work was its participation in an important project
                    described by the author as follows (p. xvii): "In 1937 the National
                    Association of Insurance Commissioners in cooperation with the Actuarial Society
                    of America and the American Institute of Actuaries undertook the construction of
                    modern mortality tables and the preparation of model bills for more scientific
                    and equitable nonforfeiture and policy valuation laws. Five years later the task
                    was completed and the work to secure adoption by the <pb n="409" id="VAA4025-052-4-095"/> states began. In another five years the legislation
                    was adopted or made acceptable by 47 of the 48 states and the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and for the first time a near uniformity on basic principles was
                    arrived at among the states. There is perhaps no comparable example in American
                    history of expedition in voluntary cooperative accomplishment on a broad
                    legislative front by the states. In this achievement the American Life
                    Convention and its member companies in 41 states and the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> played an important part."</p>
            <p>The book is divided into two parts. Part I describes the beginnings of life
                    insurance and its history in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> up to 1906, the year in which the American Life Convention was
                    established. Part II occupies the remainder of Volume I and the bulk of Volume
                    II. It consists of the history of the American Life Convention and the
                    author's conclusions. The remainder of Volume II consists of some 350
                    pages of appendices. The author's treatment is almost completely
                    chronological, necessitated, as he states, by the fact that the principal
                    business of the American Life Convention was transacted at its annual meetings.
                    And, although its activities were carried on throughout the year, they were
                    reflected in the reports presented at the annual meeting. Topical treatment,
                    therefore, occurs primarily within the chronicle of each year.</p>
            <p>While a strict chronological arrangement was undoubtedly necessary, the reader
                    soon develops a sense of discontinuity as the discussion moves rapidly from
                    topic to topic, each frequently bearing little relationship to the one which
                    precedes or the one which follows. Yet the difficulty diminishes as topics which
                    occupied the attention of the Convention over a period of years begin to
                    reappear year after year in the chronicle.</p>
            <p>As a reference work, the history will prove highly useful to the student of life
                    insurance. In addition, the excellent index as well as the
                    "Bibliographical Note" and Appendix E, "Papers Read
                    Before the American Life Convention and Its Sections," will add greatly
                    to its usefulness. Since most of the activities of the Convention are reflected
                    in the papers read at its annual meetings and the meetings of its various
                    sections, the usefulness of such a list is self-evident. The <pb n="410" id="VAA4025-052-4-096"/> Bibliographical Note consists of a carefully
                    selected and annotated bibliography.</p>
            <p>It appears to this reviewer that the author clearly has accomplished his purpose,
                    namely "to assemble and preserve scattered materials, some of them
                    ephemeral, which pertain to the activities and organizations of men in a field
                    which the writers of history usually pass over." But he has also given
                    us at least an outline of the later history of life insurance in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, setting its various facets into true perspective, and has
                    suggested phases which will bear further investigation and recording. It is to
                    be hoped that business historians will follow the paths of investigation the
                    author has suggested and will not let this challenge and opportunity pass by
                    default.</p>

            <p>Among petroleum lawyers a source of interesting speculation is the exact nature
                    of pipelines as common carriers. Court decisions have, in general, served to
                    confuse an already mixed-up set of federal laws regarding petroleum pipelines.
                    Some of these disagreements may well be solved by Mr. Johnson's study.
                    This monograph was prepared and published by the American Historical Association
                    through the assistance of the Albert J. Beveridge Fund. It was the prizewinning
                    manuscript submitted to the association's board of judges. Its subject
                    is the growth and establishment of the system of transportation of crude oil
                    through pipes from its beginnings in <placeName>

            <p>This book might well have been entitled "The Rise and Successful
                    Progress of the Standard Oil Company and Its Pipelines." Until Standard
                    Oil was forced to bow to the pressure of public opinion and the Sherman
                    Anti-Trust Act, it operated the largest and most successful of pipelines. From
                    1870 until the first decade of this century Standard <pb n="411" id="VAA4025-052-4-097"/> Oil combined, fought, operated, bought and sold its

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> when the latter's pipeline system, the Empire
                    Transportation Company, could no longer compete. It could not stop the
                    combination of independents known as the Tide Water Pipe Company that competed
                    with it successfully for a time. Standard ended by becoming the chief pipeline
                    operator and transporter of crude oil east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. That was its position in 1906 in the Lima-Indian and Appalachian
                    oil fields. By 1906 the Pure Oil Company had become its principal competitor.</p>
            <p>Standard and Pure Oil succeeded because both were able to conduct their affairs
                    according to the best business methods of the time. Hard work, engineering
                    efficiency, and ruthlessness when necessary were the factors making for ultimate
                    success. This is the theme of Johnson's study. When free competition
                    was permitted those companies able to find and follow the best business methods
                    survived. Standard Oil was better managed, better financed, and better
                    organized. It could crush individuals and roll over the opposition in fine
                    style. In so doing Standard looked at the currently accepted practices of its
                    competitors, the railroads, and followed their methods.</p>
            <p>The monopolistic position of Standard Oil and the way in which it reached that
                    position came under attack by the muckrakers. Ida M. Tarbell and Henry D. Lloyd
                    directed public indignation against the way in which a vital commodity was being
                    priced and regulated by a private company. The citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> became so angry at one point that this otherwise self-proclaimed
                    home of rugged individualism was put into the oil refining business by those
                    people who hated Standard Oil. Not only in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> but also in the eastern states, whenever a pipeline pool or
                    monopoly became too strong there was an attack upon it in the state
                    legislatures.</p>
            <p>State legislation of pipelines, however, was not too successful, mainly because
                    of the pressure of special interests such as the railroads. In the end it was
                    aroused public opinion, thanks to the reformers, that backed President Theodore
                    Roosevelt in getting Congress to pass effective regulatory legislation. But
                    regulation under the Interstate <pb n="412" id="VAA4025-052-4-098"/> Commerce
                    Commission came too late to alter the form and pattern of operation of the
                    pipeline industry. As Johnson writes: "When the pipeline issue appeared
                    on the national scene as a subject for public policy, it was too late to change
                    the place that private enterprise and inadequate public policies on the state
                    level had given pipelines in the petroleum industry" (p. 251).</p>
            <p>In writing this first-rate study of a part of one of our most important
                    industries, the author has made use of nearly every possible source. For his use
                    of public documents, biographies, newspapers, and magazines he should be
                    commended for his diligence and his research. The Roosevelt papers and the
                    hearings before committees of various state legislatures proved a mine of
                    information. State and federal investigatory bodies at one time or another
                    accumulated a large amount of information about our economic growth. No one can
                    safely write industrial history and ignore these usually dull compilations of
                    statistics and opinions. One most important source, however, was apparently
                    unavailable for this study and its absence detracts from the overall value of
                    the book: management's side as revealed in its documents was not given
                    prominence either in the book itself or its bibliography. It is quite probable,
                    though, that this information could not be obtained. What material Johnson did
                    use has been treated with impartiality.</p>
            <p>This book is not for the general reader. It is written with a concentration and
                    concern for statistics, events, and facts that makes it heavy going for all but
                    the specialist in economic history. Its chief merit lies in the information it
                    gives about how pipelines were made a weapon for successful warfare within the
                    oil industry and how the public at last stepped in to regulate this new form of
                    transportation.</p>

            <p>This slender volume, based upon research extending over a period of twenty years,
                    presents essentially all that is known of John Filson who, though his life is
                    still shrouded <pb n="413" id="VAA4025-052-4-099"/> in some degree of obscurity,
                    attained a distinct and permanent place in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> history. Filson's importance is based chiefly on his
                    production of the first map of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and on his authorship of its first history, which contained the
                    earliest account of Daniel Boone, one which created the prototype of the
                    national hero of the frontier.</p>
            <p>Filson's present biographer, great-great-grandson of Samuel Filson, a
                    cousin of the subject of the volume, brings to the study an obvious personal
                    interest. Yet he refrains from claiming more than the record reveals as he comes
                    to the conclusion that Filson was not a great man and as an intellectual was
                    "undistinguished" (p. 126). Professor Walton suggests that
                    Filson's importance is based on his being "one of the many who
                    made up the composite greatness of the old frontier" (p. 126).</p>

                    </placeName>, and Great Britain, is carefully analyzed, as are other aspects of
                    his career which culminated in his disappearance at about the age of thirty-five
                    while on an exploring expedition which was threatened by Indian attack in the
                    Miami country north of the <placeName>

            <p>In Professor Walton's carefully documented study, various details
                    regarding Filson's life are corrected. A marriage record of his parents
                    found in the Old Swedes' Church in Wilmington, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, and other evidence indicate that Filson was born about December
                    10, 1753, rather than 1747, as previous <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> historians (as well as the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American
                        Biography</hi>) had conjectured. The author also shows evidence to
                    contradict commonly accepted views that Filson's land claims in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> were based on military warrants.</p>
            <p>Thus, from the standpoint of materials now known to be extant, a nearly
                    definitive life of Filson is presented. Enclosed in a pocket on the inside back

            <p>The publication of Professor Cleland's book is particularly well timed,
                    coming in the midst of the bicentennial anniversary of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s initial journeys into the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley. In the narrative the author has depended predominantly upon
                    the writings of Washington, but on occasion he has supplemented this source
                    rather liberally from letters and journals particularly when Washington is
                    silent or when there seems to be a discrepancy in his accounts and the accounts
                    of others. The work is concerned with Washington's seven trips into the
                    "Western country" to deal with the problems of the frontier.
                    The first of these expeditions occurred in 1753 when, as a young major of
                    twenty-one, Washington was commissioned by Lieutenant Governor Dinwiddie to
                    carry a letter to the French at Fort LeBoeuf. From this beginning, the story is
                    carried to the decade of the 1790's, shortly before Washington retired
                    from public life.</p>
            <p>As a result of attempting to relate some of the important early history of the
                    upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its immediate vicinity, "in the words of one of its
                    most distinguished visitors, George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (p. vii), the book tends to lack continuity. This fact is
                    of great importance if the book is directed, as the author has suggested,
                    "to people who like to read history rather than professional
                    historians" (p. vii). Dr. Cleland has, however, made short prefatory
                    remarks at the beginning of each new section of the book which aid in overcoming
                    this lack of continuity. In these brief paragraphs an attempt is made to bridge
                    the rather large gaps and to set the scene for each new episode.</p>
            <p>Because of the many place names used and the various routes described at one time
                    or another in the book, it is unfortunate that the author did not see fit to use
                    maps more extensively throughout the narrative. Only three maps are reproduced
                    in the book and these are not placed particularly well to lend themselves for
                    immediate reference by the reader. Again, this is a shortcoming that tends to be
                    magnified if the book is directed toward the non-professional historian. Another
                    rather serious omission is the lack of <pb n="415" id="VAA4025-052-4-101"/> a
                    bibliography. One wonders many times throughout the book what Professor
                    Cleland's sources are when he augments content by remarks in footnotes.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the author has succeeded in writing an account that will be used by the
                    "average" reader. And if this be true, perhaps this is
                    justification enough for the labor. It is certainly true that the book contains
                    many interesting commentaries on such subjects as early military life, early
                    modes of travel, methods of dealing with the Indians as well as the chicanery of
                    the red man, and early politics.</p>

            <p>This book was prepared and published in connection with the celebration in 1956
                    of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the first presbytery. The editors,
                    all of whom are well versed in the history of American Presbyterianism, have
                    gathered together approximately 170 manuscripts—letters, journals,
                    diaries, periodicals, minutes, and other documents which give a vital, warm
                    glimpse into the lives of the men and women who <hi rend="i">were</hi> the
                    Presbyterian Church—from colonial times to the present. The documents
                    have been carefully chosen and skillfully edited, with editorial explanations
                    preceding each document.</p>
            <p>Part I deals with colonial Presbyterianism, beginning with the minutes of the
                    first presbytery in 1706. It includes the organization and work of the church
                    down through the adoption of standards in the "Adopting Act of
                    1729." Chapter two of this section relates to the Great Awakening,
                    which divided the Synod (organized in 1717), but which swept thousands into the
                    churches and stimulated the organization of educational institutions and
                    development of democracy. There are interesting documents relating to: the
                    "Log College"; revivals; Gilbert Tennent's sermon in
                    1740 on the "danger of an unconverted ministry"; the
                    missionary activities of David Brainerd and others; the establishment <pb n="416" id="VAA4025-052-4-102"/> of the New <placeName>

                    </placeName>); the schism of 1741; and the beginnings of missionary activities
                    in the Appalachian area. In chapter three there are documents which reveal the
                    attitude of the church toward British rule. One of the most interesting of these
                    is a pastoral letter lauding the repeal of the Stamp Act. A lengthy pastoral

                    revolt is not lawlessness, but the preservation of the rights of free
                    men" (p. 80).</p>
            <p>Part II traces the growth and expansion of the church from the close of the
                    Revolution to the end of the Civil War. Among the most significant documents are
                    those on the founding of the General Assembly in 1787; the
                    "disciplining problem" in the churches; the missionary work of
                    William Williamson and others; the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Seminary (1811), the Board of Missions (1816), the Educational
                    Society (1818), and "a general Board of Education" (1812);
                    manual labor schools; the "revolt" of ninety-two students at
                    Lane Theological Seminary in 1834; the attitude of the church toward immigration
                    (its leaders were disturbed) and toward Manifest Destiny (its leaders approved);
                    missionary activities in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> of the New School missionaries Dr. and Mrs. Marcus Whitman from
                    1836 until their murder in 1847; the Board of Publication in 1838. There are
                    many documents relating to Presbyterian views on slavery. Most of these are
                    northern accounts, but the southern view is well stated in the
                    "Southern Address," adopted by the Presbyterian church of the
                    Confederate States of America in 1861, and probably written by Dr. James
                    Thornwell of <placeName>

            <p>Part III covers the history of Presbyterianism from 1870 to the present. In a
                    chapter entitled "Reconciled and Expanding," there are
                    documents about the missionary activities of Sheldon Jackson and others in the
                    Far West and abroad; the Board of Home Missions and the Woman's Board
                    of Missions (1879); and Joseph <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the famous "Sabbath school missionary." There
                    are several documents dealing with the problems posed by Darwin's
                    doctrine of evolution. The editors point out that prior to 1899 the church
                    tended to resist social and cultural change, but <pb n="417" id="VAA4025-052-4-103"/> that with the advent of the twentieth century, the
                    church made an "adjustment." The Confession of Faith was
                    revised and the Book of Common Worship introduced. Particularly during World War
                    I, the church carried on missionary and welfare activities among the laboring
                    people; it went through a fundamentalist controversy; it suffered with the
                    people during the Great Depression. It also took the view that the essential
                    doctrines of the church had to be confirmed by the majority of the presbyteries.</p>
            <p>The final chapter reveals intimations of fresh creativity since 1937. Chaplains
                    brought spiritual encouragement to men in the armed forces during World War II;
                    the church launched a "reconstruction fund"; and the New Life
                    Movement brought renewed spiritual vigor to local churches. Christian work on
                    college and university campuses increased perceptibly, and more interest was
                    taken in international affairs and in the quest of social justice.</p>

            <p>Historical research has gone far toward demolishing the interpretation of the
                    decade following the War of 1812 as an "Era of Good Feelings,"
                    if indeed such an interpretation ever was accepted by careful scholars. The
                    one-party situation prevailing during the administration of James <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> actually stimulated personal rivalries and political proliferation.
                    The Panic of 1819, followed by a depression, as well as the acrimonious debate

                    were many ill feelings, at least up to <pb n="418" id="VAA4025-052-4-104"/>
                    1825. His purpose is to analyze the characteristics of the area and to give an
                    account of the political battles waged there. Drawing principally from the local
                    newspapers for his sources, he describes the minutiae of party alignments and
                    instrumentalities in an informative though ponderous manner. The wing of the
                    Republican party favoring the "delegate" or
                    "caucus" system, as opposed to the "Independent
                    Republicans" (including some unreconstructed Federalists), contributed
                    to the evolution of the "convention" device of nominating
                    candidates and drafting platforms by the middle 1820's. Local
                    "committees of vigilance" and "committees of
                    correspondence" carried on the organizational work of directing
                    campaigns. Mr. Kehl transmits to the reader his thorough familiarity with these
                    conditions, especially with the role of the press. He concludes with a treatment
                    of the elections in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and demonstrates that area's overwhelming support of
                    Andrew Jackson in 1824.</p>
            <p>The author disagrees with Frederick Jackson Turner that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley had essentially uniform characteristics. He finds western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> to be a region by itself with its own traits. It was, he asserts,
                    "Western in attitude, but had to depend upon a legislature at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harrisburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> that was largely eastern in sympathy" (p. 12). Thus,
                    unlike <placeName>

                    </placeName> did not offer an "economic sanctuary" for
                    debtors. In several respects, says Mr. Kehl, state lines and the Alleghenies
                    marked off a distinctive region with a consequently unique pattern of habits and
                    attitudes. The thesis may be sound as applied to this decade of American
                    history, but it would be tenuous if extended to earlier or later years.</p>

            <p>One of the less-well tilled fields in the history of American democracy is the
                    evolution of self-government in the territories. Because of special
                    circumstances, the experience in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> has been frequently referred to, but until recently <pb n="419" id="VAA4025-052-4-105"/> very little attention has been given to that phase
                    of history elsewhere. Fortunately, in the last few years, belated study has been
                    given to these ground-roots activities by men such as R. Carlyle Buley, Paul W.
                    Gates, James C. Malin, Earl Pomeroy, and others. Now another scholar is turning
                    his attention to these neglected historical acres with excellent results.</p>
            <p>The Pacific Northwest in the years of its origins was far distant from the
                    population mass of the nation and enjoyed only the most rudimentary means of
                    communication with the rest of the republic. It grew up in almost complete
                    isolation. However, its first citizens in most instances came from the various
                    states in the Union, and the majority of them undoubtedly brought with them
                    habits and traditions of political behavior including membership in one or
                    another of the national parties. As they labored to create the bodies politic of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, they made use of what they brought with them. Their most dominant
                    motivations, however, which produced leadership were the twin desires to rule
                    and to develop. Their task was complicated by the fact that while they could
                    choose their legislatures, and thus make their laws through their own
                    representatives, and could send a spokesman to Congress, they must tolerate
                    executive and judicial appointments by the Federal government. This division of
                    authority complicated the task and made these isolated pioneers particularly
                    sensitive on the question of self-government.</p>
            <p>This issue of self-government dominated in the Northwest even in the tense days
                    of the sectional conflict that was leading to bloodshed during the
                    1850's. Johannsen traces the local struggles among contending factions
                    as they sought for advantage and shows how they made use of the sectional issues
                    for their local ends in these various contests. The question of slavery by the
                    very nature of the physiographical situation could only be academic, but the
                    problem of territorial self-government raised by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> struggle was not. An intricate pattern of the real and the
                    artificial as elements in political strategy is traced as fully as the paucity
                    and specialized character of the evidence will permit. Unfortunately, this
                    evidence seems to be almost wholly the writings of political journalists,
                    leaders and workers, so it is of necessity incomplete, slanted, and
                    imperceptive. But between <pb n="420" id="VAA4025-052-4-106"/> the lines one
                    senses something of the social process which shaped these political behavior
                    patterns and institutions. The author is to be commended for this careful and
                    skillful handling of unsatisfactory and partial evidence. It is to be hoped that
                    he will continue to till this neglected field, for his insights are bound to be
                    increasingly significant. He grasps the fact of greatest significance, namely,
                    the self-contained and locally dominated nature of the territorial political
                    experience.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, at the present time academic freedom would appear to be one of the
                    poor relations among the various freedoms. For so far as the general public is
                    concerned, any such thing as a claim to academic freedom leaves most people
                    indifferent or, if not indifferent, then mistrustful or even hostile. Worse
                    still, the indifference or mistrust or hostility seems to be compounded of
                    serious misconceptions and misinformation about the nature and purpose of
                    academic freedom.</p>
            <p>In the hope of at least partially correcting this situation, these two books were
                    written. More specifically they were written at the behest of the American
                    Academic Freedom Project—a project certainly with a very high
                    sounding title, and consisting of an executive committee and panel of advisers
                    drawn from some of the country's most distinguished educators and men
                    of affairs. Actually, the project would seem to be largely a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University affair. Established as a result of the
                    "initiative and generosity" of Louis M. Rabinowitz, it appears
                    to have been directed and executed by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>

               </hi>, was written by Professors Hofstadter and Metzger, both of
                    the History Department of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, Part I, entitled "The Age of the
                    College," by Professor Hofstadter, and Part II, "The Age of
                    the University," by Professor Metzger. Indeed, these respective titles
                    are peculiarly significant in that the authors tend to identify the age of the
                    college with the lack of academic freedom and the age of the university with the
                    emergence of it. And the basic reason for this would seem to be that, as these
                    authors tell the story, the antebellum college in this country was largely
                    regarded as simply "a place in which the received truth is to be passed
                    on," rather than as "a place in which the search for truth is
                    to be carried on through free inquiry and the exchange of views" (p.
                    91). Or putting it a little differently, the objective of the older colleges was
                    more the conservation of knowledge, whereas that of the modern university has
                    been rather the discovery of new knowledge. In consequence, the atmosphere of
                    the older college is depicted as having been primarily a religious and
                    denominational one, tempered intermittently by the more benign influences of
                    wealth and enlightenment, whereas that of the university is represented as being
                    largely a scholarly and scientific one, tempered frequently by the protests and
                    pressures of denominational or economic reaction.</p>
            <p>As one reads the book, one may not be quite so sure that academic freedom must
                    have had necessarily and in principle the sort of institutional setting that it
                    is here represented as having had historically and in fact. But after all, it is
                    history that the authors are writing, and most informative and readable history
                    at that. Nor is there any question but that the reader will find that he is
                    served a most rich and varied fare, ranging all the way from an account of <pb n="422" id="VAA4025-052-4-108"/>

                    Starr Jordan and the "devout" but
                    "imperious" Mrs. Stanford (p. 437). Likewise, there are
                    excellent sections on the medieval university, the German influence on American
                    educational institutions, the impact of big business on our colleges and
                    universities, the founding and early history of the American Association of
                    University Professors, etc.</p>
            <p>In the second of the two volumes under review, Professor MacIver, the
                    distinguished <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> sociologist and himself the director of the American Academic
                    Freedom Project, undertakes the somewhat more difficult task of discussing, in
                    the sense of explaining and defending, academic freedom in our time.
                    Unfortunately, comparisons are bound to be invidious, and yet it does seem that
                    while the former book under review represents a significant and novel
                    contribution to the subject, Professor MacIver's book sometimes gives
                    the impression of threshing what is now but little more than chaff.</p>
            <p>It's not that there isn't a desperate need for someone to do
                    just the sort of thing which Professor MacIver has here attempted to do. Also
                    it's not that the book is altogether without merit. Certain sections,
                    for instance, are singularly illuminating—for example, the chapter
                    devoted to academic government in this country, in which our American system of
                    dual trustee-faculty control is contrasted with the European system of sole
                    faculty control. Likewise, Professor MacIver shows no lack of courage and
                    forthrightness when it comes to facing up to some of the major issues in
                    connection with academic freedom. For instance, there is an exhaustive and
                    judicious, though, I fear, rather involved, discussion of whether Communists
                    should be allowed to teach. There is a frank facing up to the question of just
                    why academic freedom, what justifies it, and what difference would it make were
                    it to be compromised somewhat. Similarly, the author attempts to meet head-on
                    various charges to the effect that academic freedom is nothing but a form of
                    special privilege, or that it fosters only rights to the neglect of
                    responsibilities, etc.</p>
            <p>All of this is admirable. And yet why does the book seem to misfire? Perhaps the
                    reason is just that it is so obviously a book by a professor—which
                    probably means that <pb n="423" id="VAA4025-052-4-109"/> it will turn out to be
                    a book only for professors. And yet such a result would be quite contrary to the
                    avowed purpose of the project, which was certainly not to preach to the
                    converted, but rather to win people outside the academic profession to a better
                    understanding of the cause of academic freedom. But to this end I am afraid that
                    this particular book is about as ill-adapted as a set of carpenter's
                    tools would before brain surgery.</p>

            <p>The biographical and historical source material which Emma Lou Thornbrough had at
                    her disposal for this account of Eliza Ann Cooper Blaker's life and
                    work was scant, as she says in her Preface. She has, however, made the most of
                    it and has chosen her many quotations with such care that they illumine the
                    inner nature of this pioneer woman educator whose influence radiated in an
                    ever-widening circle.</p>
            <p>Born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> before the Civil War, Eliza Cooper from her earliest years was a
                    doer. By the time she was twenty-six she had embarked upon the kindergarten work
                    which was to remain one of the prime interests of her life and, like the girl of
                    today, had begun to combine career and marriage. Although she came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1882 with her husband, Louis J. Blaker, to organize a
                    kindergarten in a private school, she soon left this work to set up free
                    kindergartens for a Children's Aid Society founded the previous year.
                    So successful was she that it became necessary for her to train in her home the
                    young women to teach in these kindergartens within and without the city. From
                    this humble beginning a school gradually evolved until finally, by means of hard
                    work, courage, and much faith, permanent quarters for the training school were
                    acquired in 1903. Aside from the tuition fees, all money for the school had to
                    be solicited, and Mrs. Blaker herself contributed generously.</p>
            <pb n="424" id="VAA4025-052-4-110"/>
            <p>Strenuous as the training was, with its combination of teaching in the free
                    kindergartens each morning, classes each afternoon, and lessons at night, many
                    young women came to study under Mrs. Blaker. Her standards remained high and she
                    kept up her work, which had become nationally known, until her death in 1926.
                    She had foreseen rightly that the future of the school might best be served
                    through affiliation with a university, and four years after her death Mrs.
                    Blaker's school was made a part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University.</p>
            <p>Throughout Professor Thornbrough's account the figure of Eliza Blaker
                    dominates the background, guiding, managing, and influencing, while the
                    foreground is filled in with the women of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> who upheld and furthered her ideals, with the trainees who carried
                    out her practical ideas, and with her innumerable "children"
                    in the free kindergartens who were led gently and naturally, though firmly, by
                    loving hands into paths which would mold character. Unwittingly, or so it
                    appears, the author has caught a personality trait well known to Eliza
                    Blaker's students, namely, her unconscious reserve. Much as her
                    trainees loved her, they did not feel that they could get close to her.</p>
            <p>Upon closing the little volume, one wishes that Emma Lou Thornbrough had searched
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers (only five press notices, none prior to 1900, are
                    mentioned) to find, if possible, other pertinent material. For example, it is
                    interesting that the motto Mrs. Blaker adopted for her school was <hi rend="i">Mehr Licht</hi>, but one looks in vain for a note of explanation. No doubt
                    Mrs. Blaker knew that these two German words are the attributed last words of
                    Goethe, but what did they signify for her?</p>
            <p>Two minor points might be mentioned: It is a little startling to have Mrs. Blaker
                    referred to, without explanation, as "Doctor" on pages 76 and
                    78, whereas the information relative to the title is not to be found until page
                    84. Secondly, the lists of names which occur <hi rend="i">passim</hi> from page
                    37 on, names of women and of men who served, supported, advised, etc., might
                    well have been relegated to the notes, because, unless the reader is familiar
                    with the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, such names are meaningless.</p>
            <p>The author closes her account with a quotation from the tribute paid Mrs. Blaker
                    by William A. Millis, President Emeritus of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. Fine as the tribute is, it cannot <pb n="425" id="VAA4025-052-4-111"/> be accepted completely. Investigation will show
                    that the statement, "she [Eliza Blaker] led the move for trained
                    teachers, enriched curricula …" is not tenable unless
                    qualified. Eliza A. Blaker began the training of her teachers in 1882, but
                    Indiana University had already started classes in elementary teacher training
                    thirty years before. Furthermore, enriched curricula had been introduced into
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> elementary schools as early as 1865–1866 with the
                    introduction of German and vocal music.</p>
            <p>Emma Lou Thornbrough has produced a most interesting account of Eliza A.
                    Blaker's life and work and she is to be congratulated for having
                    brought this memorial to the attention of the public. If Eliza A.
                    Blaker's ideals could again be inculcated into kindergartens throughout
                    the nation and if her ideals of character training could again become basic,
                    perhaps a significant step might be taken toward the prevention of juvenile
                    delinquency.</p>

                    the story of the destructive powers of ambition in the life of Salmon P. Chase,
                    Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln and later Chief Justice of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName>. The entire book may be summarized in a few words: Salmon P. Chase
                    is willing to make many compromises and do many things to be elected President;
                    Kate is willing to do anything to see her father President; and Sprague is
                    willing to finance it all for the love of Kate's body and the hope that
                    he might become a satellite hero. In <pb n="426" id="VAA4025-052-4-112"/> the
                    end Kate pulls down the pillars of their lives and they perish in the ruins.</p>
            <p>The book started out as a doctoral dissertation under Professor Avery Craven at
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Then it was revised by Mr. Belden and his wife and developed into
                    a semi-popular biographical study of the three people mentioned above. It has
                    retained at least the form of the earlier scholarly study by the use of
                    footnotes, but the professional historian will wonder about the way some of them
                    are used. For example, it is considered necessary to cite a footnote to
                    substantiate the statement that after the first battle at Bull Run the North
                    began to prepare for serious warfare. The authority for this is Margaret
                    Leech's <hi rend="i">Reveille in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, a book the historian would hardly accept as proof in a
                    scholarly work. At the same time there are many pages purporting to give the
                    most intimate thoughts of the three main characters and these pages carry no
                    footnotes of any sort.</p>
            <p>This is not to say that the book is a poor one. It most certainly is not. While
                    this reviewer may doubt the scholarly authenticity of certain sections he is
                    quite prepared to admit that the book is well written and interesting. The
                    transformation of Chase from an unctuous and ambitious politician into a Chief
                    Justice of integrity and some stature is well done. Similarly the deterioration
                    of William Sprague is deftly handled. And fascinating Kate! She never changes,
                    but in the end it is quite obvious that the brilliance of the diamond turns out
                    to be the cheap sparkle of a rhinestone.</p>
            <p>In addition to presenting a character study of the principals there is also a
                    parade of men and events connected with the wartime government in the North: Jay
                    Cooke who financed the war by devious methods; the strutting Roscoe Conklin,
                    Kate's lover; Sprague's fellow traitors in the scheme to sell
                    arms to the Confederates; and wartime society at its watering places. All these
                    give a glimpse behind the scenes of a nation at war. It is regrettable that
                    there are so few illustrations to highlight the characters and events.</p>

            <p>The correspondence of the Negro barber George A. Myers and the distinguished
                    historian James Ford Rhodes contains some pertinent information about the
                    American scene from 1910 to 1923. The very fact that these two men should become
                    fast friends and through the years exchange hundreds of letters is an
                    interesting sidelight on early twentieth-century America. Besides the personal
                    tie between Myers and Rhodes there were other factors which greatly stimulated
                    their friendship. They were both loyal, conservative Republicans; both were
                    great admirers of Marcus A. Hanna; they were intelligent, well-informed
                    Americans interested in the history of their country; and the historian,
                    whenever possible, visited the Hollenden Hotel barber shop in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, to be shaved and trimmed by the barber.</p>
            <p>The important service that Myers rendered the Republican party is evidenced by
                    the fact that his vote in the Republican National Convention in 1892 gave the
                    control of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> delegation to the Hanna-McKinley faction. Four years later Myers
                    was named chairman of the Republican Entertainment Committee for colored
                    delegates to the National Convention. In 1898, as the barber later wrote the
                    historian, "I put my head in the door of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Penitentiary to make him [Hanna] U.S. Senator" (pp.
                    117–118). This the Negro did when he purchased a Negro
                    legislator's vote which enabled Hanna to be elected to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate by a vote of 72 to 71. By 1920 the barber was informing his
                    historian friend that he had voted the Republican ticket and would continue to
                    do so in every election, even if the Grand Old Party nominated a yellow dog for
                    its candidate.</p>
            <p>Repeatedly in these letters one finds discussion of the race problem, especially
                    as it applied to the South. Myers was of the opinion that this complex issue
                    could be solved if the Negro were given the white man's opportunity. As
                    Rhodes was adding volumes to his several volume <hi rend="i">History of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, his barber friend urged him to write of the
                    Negro's role in gaining the Union under <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="428" id="VAA4025-052-4-114"/> and in preserving the Union under Lincoln.
                    When Rhodes requested Myers to write a history of the American Negro, the latter
                    countered that historians, like gentlemen, were born not manufactured.</p>
            <p>These two correspondents agreed that the nomination of Justice Charles Evans
                    Hughes in 1916 was a dangerous precedent. They shared the opinion that the
                    G.O.P. hungered after loaves and fishes and that the party bosses believed that
                    Hughes could win. Myers was greatly pleased with the Republican nominee, that
                    is, until he read the Hughes acceptance speech and heard him speak. Then he was
                    sadly disappointed. Rhodes thought that Hughes talked over the heads of the
                    common people and made no votes among the better educated class. The barber and
                    the historian agreed that Woodrow Wilson was stronger in the Midwest after
                    Hughes' tour than before.</p>
            <p>On some national issues Myers and Rhodes held unlike opinions. Rhodes, for
                    example, in 1913 favored the Underwood tariff bill and the graduated income tax.
                    On the other hand, Myers understood Rhodes' position but he was, he
                    confessed, a dyed-in-the-wool protectionist. The theory of free trade, Myers
                    wrote, was well-nigh unanswerable, but the theory and the practicability were
                    diametrical.</p>
            <p>Many of the letters between these two friends have been lost. Those that have
                    remained are valuable and interesting. This reviewer regrets the paper binding
                    of the book. But the introduction, footnotes, and index are ample and the
                    illustrations are well selected.</p>

                    </placeName> and Jefferson educated students mainly for the professions, and
                    some of their students attained regional and even national distinction. Among
                    the latter were Henry A. Wise, governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and later a Confederate general; William Holmes McGuffey, famous
                    for the McGuffey readers; and Andrew Wylie, who served as president of Jefferson
                    and then of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> before he became the first president of Indiana College (Indiana
                    University) in 1829.</p>
            <p>During Wylie's presidency of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> there was considerable sentiment for a merger of the two
                    neighboring colleges. This movement for union, however, bogged down in bitter
                    strife and vituperation. This was not an isolated case, for the nineteenth
                    century abounded in notable instances of college and church controversies.
                    However, the one which occurred at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> while Wylie was president involved both elements and was apparently
                    harsher and more intense than a squabble limited either to professors or
                    preachers. Doubtless Wylie's Scot and Presbyterian background helped to
                    qualify him for the fray! At any rate by the time the trustees of the infant
                    Indiana College were ready to elect their first president, Wylie was available.</p>
            <p>Although the author of this volume is quite friendly to the traditions of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Jefferson colleges and is likewise generous in estimating their
                    contributions, she does less puffing than is commonly done in such histories.
                    Her account, however, could have been encompassed in fewer pages, especially
                    since it is largely restricted to the years preceding their merger in 1865.
                    Moreover a press as important as that of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> should have included the footnotes on the relevant pages instead of
                    massing them together near the end of the book.</p>
            <p>This volume tells its story in an informal manner but the successive parts and
                    episodes are not so well connected as they might have been. The emphasis is on
                    the background and the beginnings of the two colleges, the successive
                    administrations, the curriculum, the faculty, finances, and student life. Basic
                    documents concerning the colleges are included in an appendix.</p>
