                        <l n="387">A name well known to council wise Canawacs,</l>

                        <l n="395">Drew up the waters of destruction</l>

                        <l n="400">On the top of the highest mountain</l>
                        <l n="401">Of all the earth known to man.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="402">When the water had come up to the top branches</l>
                        <l n="403">Until only their heads were above it,</l>
                        <l n="404">And had stood still for three weary suns,</l>
                        <l n="405">Then slowly it drew back, and left the earth barren,</l>
                        <l n="406">So there was no fire to cook food</l>
                        <l n="407">For the hungry Sachem and his mate,</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="409">Then the Sachem sent a beaver messenger</l>
                        <l n="410">Far down to the underworld</l>
                        <l n="411">To borrow only one coal</l>
                        <l n="412">From the campfires of the dark spirits;</l>
                        <l n="413">But the beaver was not able to bring it</l>
                        <l n="414">For burning his mouth cruelly.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="415">Then he sent the fierce mountain lion,</l>
                        <l n="416">Searching all over the earth for campfires,</l>
                        <l n="417">But there was no fire to be found,</l>
                        <l n="418">For the water had been everywhere.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="419">Then he sent a little gray bird to the spirit world</l>
                        <l n="420">To bring from the campfires of the unseen country</l>
                        <pb id="VAA2435-032" n="18"/>
                        <l n="421">One living coal with which to make a fire</l>
                        <l n="422">For the cooking kettles and light-signals,</l>
                        <l n="423">And to warm the lodges of all the tribes</l>
                        <l n="424">That would follow him in suns to come.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="425">So the dauntless little gray bird</l>
                        <l n="426">Slowly winged across the far spaces.</l>
                        <l n="427">Three suns arose and set, and at the red evening</l>
                        <l n="428">When the third sun plunged its face in the sea,</l>
                        <l n="429">With all of its plumage burned a flame-tongue red,</l>
                        <l n="430">With a beak of red like hot coals</l>
                        <l n="431">And its face blackened with fire,</l>
                        <l n="432">Came the brave panting bird</l>
                        <l n="433">With a living coal held fast in its mouth,</l>
                        <l n="434">A coal snatched from the high altars</l>
                        <l n="435">Of the far country of the spirits.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="436">And so the fire gift was brought back to earth</l>
                        <l n="437">To warm the hearts and the wigwams</l>
                        <l n="438">Of every nation, for all seasons to come.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="439">The bird was sent from a stranger tribe</l>
                        <l n="440">Far to the south of our hunting grounds,</l>
                        <l n="441">Where the hot suns shine and the grass withers;</l>

                        <l n="445">And face still blackened with fire,</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="448">Often when we chanted songs of thanksgiving</l>

                        <l n="175">He had won his name by the fiercest fight</l>
                        <l n="176">Ever known among any of our warriors;</l>
                        <l n="177">But now he chose to lie in his wigwam and dream,</l>

                        <l n="181">I showed her the little flitting creatures.</l>
                        <l n="182">And when I helped her fill her basket</l>

                    <lg>

                        <l n="190">Then I dared her to race in turn with me</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="194">I set down my heaped basket of furry nuts,</l>

                        <l n="203">I saw her touch earth in smiling confidence,</l>

                        <l n="207">With greedy eyed, death hungry heart</l>
                        <l n="208">I watched her proud face.</l>

                        <l n="226">I went alone through a trail of deep forest</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="352">She stalked to where a great white flower</l>
                        <l n="353">Was resting in serene beauty,</l>
                        <l n="354">Like a sheaf of fallen moons upon the water,</l>

                        <l n="359">Then she looked at me questioningly</l>

                        <l n="509">Rang from her lips in quivering terror.</l>

                        <l n="527">The stealthy catlike death of the waves</l>
                        <l n="528">And the little famished mouths of sand,</l>
                        <l n="529">The slow mealy strangling sands,</l>
                        <l n="530">She bravely held aloft the white flower.</l>

                    <lg>

                        <l n="556">When she saw me she suddenly ceased to struggle,</l>

                        <l n="560">Slowly, slowly, Medicine Man, she sank,</l>

                        <l n="584">Of the low humming rattler</l>
                        <l n="585">Nor the foaming mouth of the knife footed killer.</l>
                        <l n="586">I dreamed that over my heart flamed and scorched</l>
                        <l n="587">And burned Coy-oy, the little sacred red bird;</l>
                        <l n="588">While my hands could not braid</l>
                        <l n="589">And put the gay ornaments in my hair,</l>

                        <l n="590">Could not put on my robe,</l>

                        <l n="597">When the hunting dogs raged</l>
                        <l n="598">And shrill clamour arose in the camp,</l>
                        <l n="599">My Mother shook me,</l>

                        <l n="603">I made the swift going down sign</l>

                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="620">With dazed hand I drew sleep from my eyes;</l>

                        <l n="624">When he tried to look far into my eyes for a sign</l>
                        <l n="625">He saw only stupid Old Man Sleep sitting there</l>
                        <l n="626">Mocking the tortured heart in his breast.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="627">Then he caught me fiercely by the shoulders,</l>

                        <l n="630">And low and hoarse he cried to me in torture:</l>

                        <l n="637">Was a part of your treasure, Yiada.</l>

                        <l n="10">Who could be spared with safety</l>
                        <l n="11">From the watch of the campfires</l>
                        <l n="12">And the care of the little happy children.</l>

                        <l n="15">To remain in waiting by her campfire</l>

                        <l n="41">And made her many signs of the great crossing,</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="43">We made long straight talk between us</l>

                        <l n="49">And make high prayer to the Great Spirit</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="51">Thus her lodge and wigwams</l>
                        <l n="52">And my Father and brothers</l>
                        <l n="53">Would be saved from all suspicion of treachery,</l>

                        <l n="56">Would be added the wailing of our tribe for Yiada.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="57">I rode my Father's swiftest remaining pony,</l>

                        <l n="59">And the hot suns of the South.</l>
                        <l n="60">I slipped through the forest and on, and on,</l>

                        <l n="62">Fast and far as the pony could run, I journeyed</l>
                        <l n="63">In the direction where my Mother had told me</l>
                        <l n="64">Lay the encampment of her people, the Mandanas.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="65">When the tired pony could travel no farther</l>
                        <l n="66">I let him feed and rest and drink;</l>
                        <l n="67">And then again I rode, moon after moon,</l>
                        <l n="68">Until he grew lean as deep snow gray wolf.</l>
                        <l n="69">When I had eaten the last crumb of meal cake,</l>
                        <pb id="VAA2435-068" n="52"/>
                        <l n="70">And there was nothing left in my bundle,</l>
                        <l n="71">But tough strings of deer meat,</l>
                        <l n="72">I came one sun-rising to signs of the Mandanas.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="73">Then, O Medicine Man,</l>
                        <l n="74">I slipped from the pony and bathed carefully,</l>
                        <l n="75">I oiled my body, braided my hair with ornaments</l>
                        <l n="76">And I put on a snow white robe</l>
                        <l n="77">Whose bleaching had been taught my Mother</l>
                        <l n="78">By Coy-oy as a secret art.</l>
                        <l n="79">I stripped the beads and the obsidian</l>
                        <l n="80">From my heaviest necklace for ceremonials</l>
                        <l n="81">And wore only the sky water blue</l>
                        <l n="82">Of the precious blue shell.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="83">When I looked into the shining water</l>
                        <l n="84">Above the white sands of the lake bed,</l>
                        <l n="85">I saw in my face great beauty like high magic,</l>
                        <l n="86">Wrought by the fear painter, the hunger moon,</l>
                        <l n="87">The far stealthy journey, the anxious heart---</l>
                        <l n="88">Beauty even greater than the beauty of Coy-oy.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="89">And so, O Medicine Man,</l>
                        <l n="90">At fire lighting I rode into the village.</l>
                        <l n="91">The spies and the couriers raced before me,</l>
                        <l n="92">Crying the wonder of my coming,</l>
                        <l n="93">The fierce, snarling dogs yapped after me,</l>
                        <l n="94">The frightened children ran from me,</l>
                        <pb id="VAA2435-069" n="53"/>
                        <l n="95">Angered squaws with harsh voices</l>
                        <l n="96">Cried threatening, forbidding words at me.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="97">When I came to the door of the Council House</l>
                        <l n="98">At the head of the long village of fatness,</l>
                        <l n="99">I slipped from my pony, and leading him after me</l>
                        <l n="100">I walked to the feet of the Great Chief</l>
                        <l n="101">Sitting in solemn state on his throne;</l>
                        <l n="102">I gave him the deeps of my troubled spirit.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="103">My eyes slowly unfolded to his eyes</l>
                        <l n="104">The tale of the robbed heart,</l>
                        <l n="105">Of the tortured sleep, of the lone moon trail,</l>
                        <l n="106">Of a fugitive from the arrows of an enemy.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="107">With Mandan speech and by the sign language</l>
                        <l n="108">I told him that I was of his blood,</l>
                        <l n="109">Of his tribe through my Mother;</l>
                        <l n="110">Seeking refuge with her people,</l>
                        <l n="111">And I told him, O Medicine Man,</l>
                        <l n="112">These things of woe, I now tell you.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="113">Beside him came the Great Chiefs and wise men,</l>
                        <l n="114">Around him the warriors, the spies and hunters;</l>
                        <l n="115">While back of the chiefs, dim in the firelight,</l>
                        <l n="116">Again and again I felt the eye of a mighty hunter,</l>
                        <l n="117">A young Brave, with the broad shoulders</l>
                        <l n="118">The round face of compassion,</l>

                        <l n="119">And the softer eye of the Mandanas</l>

                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="121">Little of my story had I told the Chieftain,</l>
                        <l n="122">As straight and fearless I faced him,</l>
                        <l n="123">Before I knew in my heart that over his head</l>
                        <l n="124">I was speaking to the stirred heart of his son.</l>
                        <l n="125">I was asking of him rest and meat, and tribe rights,</l>
                        <l n="126">Even as Coy-oy had asked meal and water</l>
                        <l n="127">Of Mountain Lion, instead of our women,</l>
                        <l n="128">For the broken fire bird that rested on her breast.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="129">As I asked I knew the answer in his heart;</l>
                        <l n="130">For I was tall and I was seasoned,</l>
                        <l n="131">And I was tortured beyond bearing,</l>
                        <l n="132">And I was beautiful with a living spirit beauty</l>
                        <l n="133">Far above that of the Mandan women around me.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="134">When they learned that my Mother</l>

                        <l n="138">They gave me the rich food of a welcome guest,</l>
                        <l n="139">And they led me to my wrinkled, gray grandfather.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l n="140">The great council of Chiefs and Medicine Men,</l>

                        <l n="142">Made Mandan sign talk to hold me securely,</l>

                        <l n="143">As if born of their tribe and village,</l>

                        <l n="145">And rode in war paint against them for vengeance.</l>
