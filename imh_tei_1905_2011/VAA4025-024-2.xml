            <p>It would, indeed, seem to be a difficult task to write a fresh and illuminating
                    essay on La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> at this late day. My reason for attempting to throw a new gleam of
                    light on so well worn a subject is to rescue from oblivion the historical fact
                    that Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert du Motier, the Marquis de. La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> spent a few hours on Indiana soil in 1825 as a guest of the state.
                    In order to give point to the reason for so august a visitor to so remote a
                    spot, it seems necessary to review, somewhat briefly, his part in two momentous
                    events in which he participated, the war for American Independence and the
                    French Revolution: and interest may be enhanced by an emphasis upon his traits
                    of character and his personal appearance—in short, what I have been
                    able to glean of the personality of our visitor. The many existing portraits of
                    La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> show marked differences. The painter wielding his brush puts much
                    of himself into his painting and produces, perhaps to an unconscious extent, his
                    own ideal of his subject in his portrait. So, to a degree, the biographer draws
                    his own conclusions from his view of materials at hand, seen through the prism
                    of his own personality. There can be little doubt that some of the modern
                    biographers are bent on destroying most of our ideals as old-fashioned and
                    obsolete, and <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-024-2-002"/> they bring out what they are
                    pleased to term "human" traits at the expense of matters of
                    the mind and spirit. It may be a coincidence but nevertheless it is noticeable
                    that they usually choose for their victims men who have not only been dead a
                    long time, but who have no virile descendants surviving them. So far, La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> has escaped the destructive pens of these biographers.</p>
            <p>La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> was nineteen years old when he presented himself to the Continental
                    Congress and received the commission of Major General. He was at that time a
                    Captain of the Dragoons in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. His commission was intended by Congress to be honorary. The
                    question of a command was left to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Unlike many Frenchmen who came over seeking at that time the
                    opportunity to make money and acquire fame and power, for which in most
                    instances they were unfit, La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> modestly announced that he sought only to serve the colonies
                    without allowance or pension. This was his attitude throughout the war. In fact,
                    he spent, of his own fortune, large sums for equipping ships to convey troops
                    from <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and to furnish American troops with necessary clothing and arms;
                    notably for his command in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> before the battle of Yorktown. When he had successfully interceded
                    with Vergennes, the Foreign Minister of Louis XVI, for more troops in 1780, he
                    stepped aside so that Rochambeau, the old and experienced general, should be in
                    command of the French army in America. During the summer in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, to use the appellation of Cornwallis, this "boy"
                    held Cornwallis from taking the American line all summer. American historians
                    agree that what La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> did at this critical juncture was all that could have been expected
                    of any commander and that it was very satisfactory to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> made no effort for a decisive offense during the summer of 1781
                    against Cornwallis, as he considered that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the Commander-in-Chief of the armies and that the stage should
                    be set and kept until <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> arrived to take charge. Here he consistently subordinated himself
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as he had done since 1777, with poise and self-restraint worthy of
                    an older head. Perhaps the statement that La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> never achieved any distinction on the field might not be so true,
                    if he, coöperating with Comte de Grasse, had struck unexpectedly and
                    heavily against Cornwallis. The capitulation which afterwards came might have
                    been the victory <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-024-2-003"/> of La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>. The first week in August, Cornwallis occupied Yorktown with 7,000
                    men. La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> had 5,000 men on <geogName>Malvern Hill</geogName>, which he was
                    pressing against Cornwallis awaiting further developments. On August 31, Comte
                    de Grasse with his great squadron arrived in Chesapeake Bay. There was no fleet
                    nearby capable of defeating him; Cornwallis was shut in from the sea. On the
                    arrival of the fleet, La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> had an accession of 3,000 men. He therefore had 8,000 men as
                    against Cornwallis' 7,000, and he had the support of the French fleet
                    which, as was subsequently proven, was strong enough to keep back the British
                    fleet. So La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>, while awaiting the arrival of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had present all the elements which brought about
                    Cornwallis' catastrophe. Yet this youth, ambitious as he was, properly
                    waited until <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s master hand could achieve the decisive victory.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have had, within the last year, a fine exhibition of modesty in Lindbergh,
                    after he had accomplished his daring feat in crossing the Atlantic ocean through
                    the air. For this he has received the applause of the world. With similar
                    modesty, in 1777, at a critical time in our struggle to throw off the British
                    yoke, there came a youth of nineteen, whose imagination was fired by that
                    incomparable manifesto declaring our independence; who, although a son of a
                    French nobleman and in the service of a monarchical regime, believed in the
                    right of the people to govern themselves; he left his family, disobeyed his king
                    and hazarded his fortune and his life in the service of the struggling colonies.
                    For the sacrifice he only asked to be allowed to serve.</p>
            <p>When he was twenty-three he returned to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> with the warm esteem and appreciation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and with the plaudits of the citizens of the new republic ringing
                    in his ears.</p>

                            dangerous temptation to a young man of just twenty-four, thirsting for
                            glory." He quotes from records that Comte de Grasse
                            "wanted to take Yorktown by assault" and that the
                            glory of Cornwallis' defeat belonged to French arms. The
                            records further state, "La Fayette was deaf to the
                            temptation." French historians consider that the Battle of
                            York-town was won by the French navy and army. In that magnificent
                            display in the Palace of <placeName>

                    this sentiment into action, he thinks, "has been systematically
                    belittled." Vergennes "had seen in America a means of
                    restoring the moral credit of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, while crushing English pride and winning the favor of a young
                    nation at a time when this was necessary." Our government has
                    recognized Vergennes' name, if not his services, by bestowing it upon a
                    fourth-class postoffice in <placeName>

                    services during that critical period. The American people never had any
                    conception of his services, as was the case of George Rogers Clark, who
                    conquered an empire from the British—a daring, momentous act. Our
                    grateful government presented Clark with a second-hand dress sword in
                    recognition of this service.</p>

                    </placeName> attempted to induce his army to declare itself in favor of the
                    king. The army was obdurate. He had tried to obey the oath to uphold a
                    constitutional monarchy; he would not submit to the decrees of the Jacobins nor
                    would he join enemies marching on his country. On August 19, 1792, La <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The Jacobin Club, as it was constituted in 1789, did not hold
                    extreme political views. Jefferson then viewed the Jacobins as the real
                    republicans of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, but later the character of the club profoundly changed. The
                    moderates left it. Thereafter its constituency included the worst elements.
                    Robespierre, its leader, demanded the impeachment of La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> as well as that of Louis XVI, charging that "La <placeName>

                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> as in America a Republican, attempted to induce his army to declare
                    itself in favor of the king." It was this organization that forced La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> into exile as a traitor to republican principles. He was captured
                    and kept in prison by the Austrians. Francis II refused to release him, even on
                    the entreaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    </placeName>'s principles were incompatible with the safety of the
                    Austrian government. He was released, however, by the Treaty of Campo Formio in
                    1797 by the stipulation of Napoleon.</p>
            <p>It is an irresistible temptation to compare La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> and Napoleon. La Fayette was altruistic. In his political and
                    military moves he really had the good of the people unselfishly in mind. When he
                    returned after the war for American independence had been concluded, he was
                    greatly venerated in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. But in less than ten years he was an exile. He was a Frenchman of
                    an old and noble family. He had enthusiasm, poise, courage and persistency, but
                    lacked aggressiveness and vision; he did not appeal to the imagination of the
                    French people. On the other hand, Napoleon, with no French background, <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-024-2-007"/> with little understanding of the French
                    people, through marvelous leadership in war and a marked degree of statesmanship
                    in government, captured and will hold for all time, not only the fancy, but at
                    last the affections of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. Although, as charged by La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>, two million Frenchmen had been his victims and their bones
                    whitened in Russia and Africa, Napoleon is today the remembered idol.</p>
            <p>If one will go to the cemetery of Picpus on the lonely road to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and take a little walk through the cemetery to the place where are
                    buried over a thousand persons beheaded during the Reign of Terror, he will find
                    the last resting place of La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> in an obscure corner, marked by a marble slab, over which two small
                    American flags flutter, placed there by American patriotic societies; beside him
                    lies his son named for his beloved friend George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>; dreary, little visited, hidden away behind the kitchen garden of
                    the nuns and closely associated with those ghastly, luckless victims of the
                    Revolution. One shudders at the forlornness, in spite of Pershing's,
                    "La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>, we are here!" and gladly turns to listen to the
                    caretaker's story, as she points out the identical spot where Jean
                    Valjean leaped on the wall with Cosette, when he was pursued by the police. It
                    is a dreary enclosure. If you reread Victor Hugo's description of it as
                    it was in Jean Valjean's time, one hundred years ago, you see little
                    change in it, except through the ravages of time.</p>
            <p>To go directly from this doleful, still place to the tomb of Napoleon, one sees
                    the dramatic contrast in death, as in life. In his will of April 20, 1815,
                    Napoleon said it was his wish that his ashes might repose on the banks of the
                    Seine. Many of us have seen in the Hotel des Invalides the ebony coffin resting
                    on the couch of porphyry beneath a gilded dome. It is flooded by a sublime
                    light, transformed by beautifully stained windows into a delicate blue and gold,
                    which seems almost heavenly. Napoleon is majestic even in death. This impressive
                    tomb, visited daily by multitudes of people, has been maintained by the French
                    people for over eighty years. The tombs of La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> and Napoleon present sharp contrasts that invoke our meditation. It
                    seems that Napoleon's place is in the hearts of the French people and
                    La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>

            <p>La Fayette was not a leader of movements or of men. In our war he was a valuable

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                        <country reg="fr">France</country>

                    French Revolution, he never found a way to lead the people out of their
                    difficulties. Apparently he misunderstood the effect on the French people of
                    what had happened during the reigns of the three Louis'. Apparently he
                    did not see that the years of government extravagance, of oppressive taxes, of
                    increasing debts had produced a condition of irritation and dissatisfaction in
                    the people against which a monarchical government could no longer stand. There
                    is no proof in history that La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> ever desired to establish a republic in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. There is proof that he desired a constitutional monarchy with the
                    abolition of the hereditary and divine rights of kings. But he was not a leader
                    who could climb upon the heights and see and direct the French people out of the
                    approaching flood of indignation that was to overwhelm Louis XVI and his court.
                    Because of that lack of vision and strength he failed.</p>
            <p>In fairness we must say that the fact that La <placeName>

                    the further fact that he failed in the French Revolution do not detract in any
                    way from his great service to the American cause in procuring with <placeName>

                    </placeName>, as an historical character, is a perplexing personality. His
                    courageous, self-sacrificing and helpful adoption of the American cause commands
                    our unstinted admiration and appreciation. His personal courage even to rashness
                    was shown on many occasions. Many times he faced death unflinchingly in crises
                    in the American and French Revolutions. He endured untold cruelties in Prussian
                    and Austrian dungeons. In 1830, when past seventy, he participated in another
                    revolution. In 1792, when he fled from his country, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> was in the hands of a maddened, murderous mob; the King's

                    </placeName>, which in turn was directed by vicious elements. His flight left no
                    reflection on his personal courage. His passion for liberty was a cult; Sedgwick
                    says it was a dogmatic cult. He adored <placeName>

                    </placeName> could have served the colonies so well as he did. In analyzing his

                    inconsistencies, we must have regard for the conditions in <placeName>

                    </placeName> at this period.</p>

                    </placeName>, before and up to the time of the Revolution and during La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>'s time, had ruling factions led by priests and nobles; it
                    had feudal conditions that were of ancient origin; monarchical government and
                    traditions of loyalty to the king had existed for eight hundred years. The
                    people had no understanding of republican principles. They had been taxed beyond
                    endurance by the autocratic governments of Louis XVI and Louis XV. They had seen
                    their money wasted; they had seen a privileged class exempt from taxes and
                    living in idleness and pomp. Of course, the privileged classes were loath to
                    give up their privileges; the religious orders to give up their benefices. No
                    one knew better than La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> that a republic could not be planted upon such a stony and barren
                    soil. Republics can only be established where there are no internal dissensions.
                    He believed, therefore, that a constitutional monarchy surrounded by republican
                    institutions was the form of government best suited to the French people of that
                    time. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> deplored the renunciation of the king by the French. The fact that
                    the first French Republic endured through war and the Reign of Terror, for only
                    seven years is some confirmation of La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>'s judgment.</p>
            <p>La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> possessed traits that had gained for him great popularity; yet,
                    perhaps, no important historical personage has had more adulation, veneration
                    and bitter criticism; he was a zealous and courageous commander of the National
                    Guard; his ideas of liberty were lofty and he was constant to them. He did not
                    believe in the divine or hereditary rights of kings any more than we believe in
                    them. The world has suffered grievously within our memory from these two
                    doctrines. The enforcement of the right of hereditary rule for the oldest son
                    has produced appallingly tragic results down the years even to recent times. He
                    undertook to act as a mediator between the forces of the Revolution and the old
                    regime, with the result that he was mistrusted and incurred the hostility of the
                    extremists on both sides. Simplicity was a strong trait of his character. His
                    ensemble was intellectual spirituality, with strong altruistic purposes and with
                    constant courageous devotion to his principles. To illustrate: the monarchists
                    or the republicans of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> would gladly have accepted him <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-024-2-010"/>
                    as a leader, or as dictator; he was offered the crown of <placeName>
                        <country reg="be">Belgium</country>
                    </placeName>, to which he replied that the crown "would become him as a
                    ring would a cat." He refused release from prison in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="au">Austria</region>
                    </placeName> on the condition that he would not re-enter Austrian territory, as
                    he felt service to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> might require him so to do. He accepted release, however, with the
                    condition that he would not go to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. He refused to vote a life tenure to Napoleon as First Consul,
                    which got him Napoleon's enmity.</p>
            <p>One almost concludes that in his devotion to republican principles his course in
                    the French Revolution stamps him as an unswerving doctrinaire lacking capacity
                    for leadership, without sufficient knowledge of the mechanics of statesmanship
                    and without political sagacity, but even if he had possessed all these
                    attributes he could hardly have saved <placeName>

                    </placeName> from the terrors and disasters of the Revolution. And yet here is
                    one of the purest and noblest characters in history; simple and brave; constant
                    to his ideals in awful cataclysms of blood and treasure.</p>

                    Union, and comprehended in his itinerary a visit to each of the twenty-four
                    states. Much has been made of his visits to some of the other states. In New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and elsewhere, many of his stopping places have been permanently
                    marked. In Indiana, his visit has not even received mention in the histories of
                    the state. The story is to be found in the newspapers of that time or a bit
                    later. Levasseur, La <placeName>

                    would certainly have become known. Levasseur tells the story of this accident
                    with vivid details. I quote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>…… at 11 o'clock the profound silence
                            which prevailed about us was only interrupted by the loud groanings of
                            the steam-machine, and the dashing of the waves against the sides of our
                            vessel. It was past midnight, and weariness began to invite to repose,
                            when on a sudden our vessel received a violent shock, and stopped short.
                            At this extraordinary occurrence, the General awoke with a spring; his
                            son leaped from his birth [sic] half dressed, and I ran upon the deck to
                            learn the cause……I took a light, and ran to the

                            in the middle of the staircase, when he perceived that he had forgotten
                            his snuff-box,……It bore a portrait of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                            </placeName>……I therefore returned to the cabin,
                            found the box, and brought it to him…… The
                            captain, assisted by two sailors, had drawn the boat up to her side, and
                            I heard his voice repeatedly call <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>

                            </placeName>! but we could not reach him, so great was the confusion
                            that prevailed around us. However,……every moment
                            increased the danger, and we perceived that it was time to make a last
                            effort. We therefore pressed through the middle of the crowd, and I
                            cried, "Here is General <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                            </placeName>!"……A free passage was opened
                            before us,……The difficulty now was to persuade the
                            General to leave the vessel before any <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-024-2-012"/> of his companions,……I got into the
                            boat……two persons helped him
                            in,……But his weight, added to my own, in the
                            little boat, almost overset it, and losing my equilibrium, I should
                            probably have fallen into the water with him, if M. Thibeaudot, formerly
                            President of the Senate of <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                            </placeName>, had not been at my side to render his assistance, which
                            saved us both……Our
                            captain……Holding the rudder with a firm hand, he
                            steered us to the left shore, ordering his two oarsmen to row gently. In
                            less than three minutes we safely reached the land, which was covered
                            with a thick wood.</p>
                        <p>Our first care in landing, was to count our number. There were nine of
                            us: the captain and his two sailors, <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                            </placeName>, Mr. Thibeaudot, Doct. <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Shelby</region>
                            </placeName>, who had in his arms a little child seven years old, a
                            daughter of a Presbyterian clergyman, the father of this young lady, and
                            myself. It was not until then that the General discovered that his son
                            was not in the boat:……He was seized with
                            anxiety,……and began to call "George!
                            George!" with all his strength……I then
                            threw myself into the boat with the captain, to go towards those who
                            were in need of assistance. The vessel was still above water, although
                            almost on its beam ends……When I had reached the
                            stern, I again called "George!" and he at last
                            replied……I immediately returned to the
                            shore……arid hastened to assure the General of the
                            safety of his son</p>
                        <p>As I had now satisfied myself that the vessel could not sink lower,
                            having found the ground,……[I] determined to bestow
                            my attention on the General, for whom we built a good bivouac, and
                            kindled a large fire near it of dry branches. While thus occupied, Mr.
                            George Lafayette and M. De Syon landed with the last of the
                            passengers……</p>
                        <p>When we had satisfied ourselves that no one had perished, we kindled a
                            number of large fires to dry our clothes and to lighten our encampment.
                            The general slept a few minutes, on a mattress which had been found
                            afloat, and was almost dry on one side; while the rest of the party
                            employed ourselves in cutting wood for the fires, in expectation of
                            daybreak. We suffered some inconvenience from a hard rain, but
                            fortunately it did not continue long……</p>
                        <p>At nine o'clock [the next morning] we persuaded the General to
                            cross the river, and go to a house we saw on the opposite shore, to
                            shelter himself from the storm, which we saw approaching. He had hardly
                            left us, when one of the company, looking out on the beach, made a
                            signal that a steam-boat was coming down the river; … This

                    that La Fayette was given the hospitality of a cabin belonging to James Cavender
                    for the night; that the next morning the people in that neighborhood, although
                    it was sparsely settled, hearing that La <placeName>

                    considerable numbers and spent the morning in conversation with him. Captain
                    Hall, who was in charge of the steamboat, in a letter of April 25, 1859, written
                    at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Marietta</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, describes the incident
                    with great particularity, but does not mention a cabin. Some very charming
                    stories of this event, embodying the hospitality of Cavender and the
                    manifestations of interest on the part of the people, have been told of La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>'s first appearance upon Indiana soil, and have been
                    accredited by several writers in Indiana. Levasseur, in his narrative,'
                    not only does not speak of any cabin on the Indiana side, but says that La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> crossed the river to reach a cabin as a shelter from an approaching
                    storm. If there had been shelter on the Indiana side, it would have been
                    unnecessary to go to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. If he left at nine o'clock in the morning, as Levasseur
                    says, he could hardly have had the ovation that morning. Near the site of the
                    Cavender cabin is a spring which has been named the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> Spring," and by tradition it is closely associated with
                    his involuntary visit that night to Indiana soil. I am inclined to think that
                    the statements of M. Levasseur must have great value, as they were written on
                    the spot and at the time the events took place.</p>
            <p>There have been many fireside stories told of La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>'s visit to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
               </placeName> and possibly
                    other places. The fact is that La <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> never visited any other part of the state of Indiana than the place
                    in the woods where he involuntarily spent the night on the shore of the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> near the present site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cannelton</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he made his public visit on May 12, and where he did receive
                    an ovation. All other visits seem to be based upon unsupported tradition,
                    without any record whatsoever. I am reminded of an authenticated story in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> of an enterprising Yankee farmer who posted a sign on his farm in
                    full view from the highway bearing these words: "This is the farm Paul
                    Revere would have came by, had he went this way." It is well to have
                    traditions. Like the hors-d'oeuvre of the feast, they are the
                    appetizers that stir the interest of people in the serious phases of real
                    history. But traditions are uncertain guides.</p>
            <p>There is a persistent tradition, fostered in private circles and in public
                    meetings of an historical nature that La <placeName>

                    this statement. A <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspaper states that on August 24, 1826, in a public meeting a
                    letter was read from the great-great-grandaughter of Colonel <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> that when her great-grandmother, Mrs. Studevant, born in 1812, was
                    a girl thirteen years old she was standing by Colonel <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s front gate. She saw two men coming up the path. They
                    inquired for Colonel <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName>. To quote: "One of the men was the great La <placeName>

                    </placeName> who fought so heroically for the Colonies." This statement
                    of a girl of thirteen as to an occurrence of one hundred and three years ago
                    seems to have been accepted in that community as evidence that La Fayette was in <placeName>

                    It is painted on bed ticking, and the tradition is that it was done by an artist
                    in La Fayette's party; that the portrait was started at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    </placeName>; that it was presented to the lodge, either by the artist or by La

            <p>In the <hi rend="i">Youth's Companion</hi> for January, 1928, a well
                    known writer for young people recounts a conversation he had fifty years ago
                    with a river pilot, Captain Hulettson, in which he was" told the
                    particulars of the sinking of the steamboat on which La Fayette was a passenger.
                    The details in some important respects are at variance with the account of
                    Levasseur; for instance, the author says the boiler exploded with an awful roar.
                    Levasseur does not mention this, although he is very explicit in his account.

                    accident published his account of it fifty years before this conversation with
                    the pilot occurred. I can account for these lurid embellishments only on the
                    theory that it must be thought that the youth of today cannot be interested in
                    what happened over one hundred years ago without them.</p>

                    traditions, like orchids, are nourished by the air. Young E. Allison, a well

                    fable.</p>
            <p>It has been given out from some quarters that La Fayette's visit to
                    Indiana was merely incidental to his visit to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. This statement will not endure against the records. On January 29,
                    1825, William Hendricks, Governor of Indiana, soon elected <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator, extended an invitation to La Fayette to visit Indiana,
                    pursuant to a joint resolution of the General Assembly.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The
                    invitation stated that, if it was too inconvenient for him to visit <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> he would be received at any town on the <geogName>Ohio
                    river</geogName> that he might designate. It will be borne in mind that reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at that time from the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> was a matter
                    of considerable difficulty and would have consumed many days because of the lack
                    of roads. On February 20, 1825, La Fayette replied to Governor Hendricks that he
                    would visit his friends of the state of Indiana on his way up the river, and
                    that the place could be assigned later. To quote from La Fayette's
                    acceptance: "I am penetrated with inexpressible gratitude to the state,

                    </placeName>. He arrived at eleven o'clock in the morning, escorted by
                    the committee. He was greeted on the Indiana shore by a salute of thrice
                    twenty-four guns discharged from three pieces of artillery stationed on the
                    river bank, at the base of three flag staffs, each seventy feet in height,
                    bearing flags with appropriate mottoes. How the birds must have fluttered at the
                    unusual burst of sound! And how the frightened wild creatures of the woods must
                    have scurried off into the tall timber! How the roar of the guns must have
                    reverberated through the quiet hills! The honored guest was escorted to the

                    years ago concerning this visit and it has furnished me with the details of the
                    occasion. Baird says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>His progress down Front street from the place of debarkation near the
                            present ferry landing, was a spectacle the like of which the city had
                            never seen before. Officials, both State and local together with many
                            other gentlemen of state and national renown from our sister
                            commonwealths vied with the vast concourse of the "common
                            people" to add to the generous expression of gratitude and
                            esteem for the guest of honor. Besides the many visitors from throughout
                            the state, the people from surrounding country had made this a holiday
                            that all might be given an opportunity to participate in the reception.
                            In addition to the three artillery companies and Capt. Parker's
                            infantry company from Charles-town, there were other military
                            organizations present, but the absence of any records concerning the
                            Indiana Militia at this period of our history, and in fact for many
                            years afterward, makes it impossible to discover who they were or from
                            whence they came.</p>
                        <p>On his arrival to the entrance to the Governor's house, the
                            General was welcomed by his Excellency James B. Ray in the following

                            had the honor of transmitting to you, and which you have received, on

                        <p>"Permit me, as the organ of their feelings, and of those of the

                            brighest epoch in the calendar of Indiana. Accept, dear General, our
                            cordial congratulations, our heartfelt welcome, and our devoted
                            aspirations for your happiness," etc.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    </quote>How little prophetic were these words! Indiana's obligations,
                    as expressed by Governor Ray, have surely been too long neglected.</p>
            <p>La Fayette responded to the welcome of Governor Ray in much the same style of
                    speech. Effulgence of speech was characteristic of that time. Reunion took place
                    with survivors of the War. It was a very moving occasion for many men.
                    Everything was done in the best possible manner within the power of the hosts.
                    At three o'clock in the afternoon, La Fayette was conducted to dinner
                    under military escort, accompanied by a band. The table was handsomely prepared
                    under an arbor of about two hundred and twenty feet in length, well covered and
                    ornamented throughout with the verdure and foliage of the forest, in which roses
                    and other flowers were interwoven by the ladies of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These quaint expressions of hospitality must have touched the
                    quick and responsive nature of the guest. The table was set in the woods, just
                    above the Governor's house about one hundred feet above Fort Street. At
                    the head of the table there was a banner on which was inscribed: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </quote>At the foot of the table was a similar one with the inscription: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    memory of General Green. Ten toasts were then offered by other distinguished
                    guests; and still other toasts by those who failed to leave copies or in the
                    confusion of the moment lost them, so that we have no record of them. The dinner
                    was honored by the presence of many distinguished gentlemen from

                    Barry and Bledsoe, Attorney-General Sharp, Colonel Anderson and Honorable John
                    Rowan. At six o'clock, La Fayette left the table and was escorted to
                    the steamboat, "General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>

                    never again has Indiana entertained a more noble or a more distinguished guest.</p>
            <p>The personal appearance of La Fayette, when he was a guest of the pioneers of
                    Indiana, is a matter of interest. Many portraits, painted one hundred years ago,
                    remain to this day; their value must be guaged by the fame of the artist
                    painting them. There are as many varying likenesses of important people of that
                    time as there were painters. No two portraits of La Fayette resemble each other
                    closely, even in the salient points. The exactness of photography had not then
                    been developed. Charles W. Peale's portrait in Independence Hall was
                    done at an early date. One in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> from sittings of La Fayette in February, 1825. La Fayette had an
                    engaging personality which to my mind is not apparent in this portrait. Another
                    portrait in the Metropolitan Museum of Art is by Rembrandt Peale. There is a
                    painting on the panel in the southwest corner of Corinthian Hall in the Masonic

            <p>In view of the dissimilarity in the portraits of these artists, the personal
                    appearance of La Fayette in 1825, when he was in Indiana, is an interesting
                    study. The fact is that the most authentic picture of him is a word painting by
                    M. Jules Cloquet, a celebrated writer on medical and other subjects, and La
                    Fayette's personal physician. In his <hi rend="i">Recollections of the

                            large, his face oval and regular; his forehead lofty and open; his eyes,

                            eyebrows; his nose was aquiline; his mouth, which was habitually

            <p>The conclusion must follow that M. Scheffer's portrait gives us a true
                    likeness of La Fayette as he was when he was in Indiana in 1825.</p>
            <p>While La Fayette was on his last visit to America, the government of Louis XVIII
                    had ended by the death of the King. Charles X, his brother, had succeeded him.
                    It fell to La Fayette's lot, after his return to <placeName>

                    and hereditary rights of kings to rule, disappear in the Revolution. Louis
                    Philippe became a citizen king, recognizing that the right to select a king was
                    seated in the people.</p>

            <p>Education is a theme which is on almost everybody's tongue. Enormous
                    sums are spent, in this country particularly, for educational purposes. Not only
                    are tuition fees of great magnitude extracted from students in many colleges and
                    universities, but vast sums of the taxpayers' money are voted annually
                    for the free education of our children. The educational problem has many angles,
                    and a story of how one person became educated is probably typical of many
                    millions.</p>
            <p>First of all the question is pertinent, "What is education?" We
                    may get one answer to this question from the philological background. The
                    English word "education" is an Anglicized Latin word, in fact
                    a Latin verb. It is derived from the word <hi rend="i">educo</hi>, the original
                    and primal meaning of which is "I lead out." Its secondary
                    meaning is, to care for a child in all of his various activities, physical,
                    mental and moral There are as many different definitions and ideas of education
                    as there are of people who ever think upon this subject at all. The most general
                    notion is to prepare a child for his activities in afterlife. As we study the
                    curricula of our free schools and see what efforts are made to fill our children
                    with learning, we begin to surmise that modern education is not leading out, but
                    filling in. The things that are poured into our children's minds from
                    the ages of six to twenty-two, when they finally emerge with a
                    Bachelor's degree is something to excite wonder and admiration. The
                    school becomes a filling station.</p>

                    interesting article on self-education in college. He stresses the point that the
                    chief actor in implanting instruction, or in receiving it, is the student
                    himself. Most of <list type="footnotes">

                    students' fees, however, are spent on the salaries of the professors.
                    The graduates of colleges have also ideas in regard to the proper purpose of
                    education, as well as the professors and president. President Lowell tells of
                    different points of view of education held by an alumnus of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the time Woodrow Wilson was president of that institution.
                    Wilson remarked that the side shows, namely, football, baseball, tennis and
                    track events, overshadowed the main tent; whereas an alumnus at the same time is
                    said to have complained that President Wilson had turned the "dear old
                    college into a damned educational institution."</p>
            <p>After all, my observation has led me to believe that the student himself is the
                    main factor in his own education, no matter what kind of education it is. If the
                    student is not educating himself, he fails to get the real benefit from the
                    flood of learning poured into his mind by his teachers and professors.</p>
            <p>There are two great factors in the history of every human being. The first and
                    most important is known as heredity. One's heredity is determined once
                    for all in the fertilization of the germ plasm. Some persons are born with an
                    education. They are descendants of a long line of educated fathers and mothers.
                    Henry Adams complained that he did not get much benefit from his studies at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The trouble was that he was educated before he was born and had
                    everything from heredity that the environment of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> could give him. The other factor in the making of the character and
                    the career of the human being is environment. While heredity is instantaneous
                    and incapable of any change from that moment, environment is a continuing
                    influence, beginning before birth and continuing until we draw our last breath.
                    Professor Minot, a student of heredity and environment, told me once that a baby
                    learned more in its first year of life on earth than the entire amount of
                    knowledge he acquired from one year until he lived to be eighty. At first this
                    statement seemed incredible to me, but when he went on to explain what a child
                    learned during its first year of life, I began to see clearly that he was right.
                    He said at birth a child is absolutely void of anything but an instinct to take
                    his own food. He has no intelligence, no judgment, no power of self-support; a
                    mere collodial mass. At the end of the year he can laugh, say a few <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-024-2-025"/> words, take notice of everything around him,
                    usually able to walk and to display a wonderful amount of intelligence on many
                    different things. It is through environment that our education is accomplished.
                    In the first years of our life, up to perhaps twenty-two or more, we depend upon
                    our parents for the proper educational environment. From the time, however, that
                    we begin to reason, which is at an indefinite age, to which some of us never
                    really attain, unless we collaborate with our parents, all their efforts for
                    leading us out are doomed to failure. How important, then, it is that those
                    features of our environment which impede rather than promote education, should
                    be removed!</p>
            <p>President Lowell, in the paper which I have already cited, regrets that boys are
                    not prepared for college at an earlier date than they are at present. He cites
                    that the average of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> freshmen is about eighteen, whereas he thinks the average age of
                    freshmen should be about sixteen. As college graduates usually follow some
                    profession, they would be able then to begin their professional life at the age
                    of twenty-four instead of at twenty-six, as the case is at present.
                    Unfortunately President Lowell does not point out the way by means of which this
                    desirable change could be secured. I think I am able to throw a little light on
                    this matter. In the first place, the topics that are taught in our graded
                    schools are entirely too many for real educational purposes. It would be a
                    tremendous lightening of the burden on our children in the early years of their
                    school activities if at least one thing which they are compelled to learn should
                    be omitted. We all admire our system of decimal coinage which makes matters
                    involving money so simple that the dullest boy can quickly learn to count money.
                    If we had simplified our other measures of quantity, length and weight, as we
                    have done in the case of our currency, it would be easy to deliver sixteen year
                    old boys to our colleges without any difficulty whatever. How unfortunate it was
                    that our fathers, in breaking away from the British coinage, did not complete
                    the transit to a system of weights and measures of a decimal character equally
                    as simple and easily learned as our money system. The failure to do this has
                    cost millions of years of worry and despair to our school children.</p>
            <p>Not only is our money system decimalized, but the weights of some of our coins
                    are in the decimal system. For instance <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-024-2-026"/> a
                    nickle weighs just five grams, a silver half dollar fifty grams, a silver
                    quarter twenty-five grams, and a silver ten cent piece 2.5 grams. Without
                    changing in any way the value of gold in our gold coinage, and with very little
                    change in the alloy, every one of our gold pieces would have a definite decimal
                    weight. The silver dollar, unfortunately, does not weigh twice as much as the
                    silver half dollar, but without changing the quantity therein, it would be
                    easily adjusted thereto. A slight change in the value of our pound would make it
                    exactly 500 grams. A slight change in the volume of our quart would make it
                    exactly one liter. A slight change in the length of our yard stick would make it
                    exactly one meter. These few changes which Congress could order in a day, would
                    abolish our present barbarous system of weights and measures. The Bureau of
                    Standards has issued a volume containing all the weights and measures of the
                    different states and municipalities, making in all a volume of 700 pages of fine
                    print.</p>
            <p>Two important events occurred in 1844. The first of these, in order of time, was
                    the sending of the first telegraphic message. I am of the opinion that our
                    college graduates in those days had acquired very considerably more Greek than
                    they possess at the present time. The word telegraph is composed of two Greek
                    words meaning, "writing at a distance." When William Cullen
                    Bryant wrote his beautiful ode on "death" he also understood
                    Greek when he named it <hi rend="i">Thanatopsis.</hi> When, however, at the
                    present day, we discover vision at a distance we fail to understand how to
                    express that fact properly in Greek. We do not call it
                    "telopsis," or "teloptky." We call it that
                    mongrel word, "television," half Greek and half Latin. How
                    unfortunate it would have been if telegraphy had been discovered in 1814. The
                    battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> was fought after peace had been made with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The telegraph would have carried the news, the battle would not
                    have been fought, Jackson would not have been President, and January 8 would
                    never have been a day for Democratic love feasts.</p>
            <p>From my own particular point of view the second important event, chronologically,
                    in 1844, was my advent upon this planet. Perhaps from one point of view I may be
                    congratulated on arriving on this planet at the very moment of the renascence in
                    invention and discovery of all kinds. Very little discovery and few inventions
                    of a startling character had featured the century from 1744 to 1844. The array
                    of astonishing <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-024-2-027"/> things in the eighty-four
                    years is so prodigious as to make it impossible even to catalogue them. It is
                    not necessary to enumerate them all, nor even any considerable part of them. To
                    have lived while all these things have been discovered is the highest privilege
                    that I can think of.</p>
            <p>In 1844, in the last year of John Tyler's administration, the facilities
                    of public instruction in the backwoods of Indiana were extremely meager. The
                    conditions had not improved very much when I reached the school age of six in
                    1850. Soon after that, however, the legislature of the state of Indiana
                    inaugurated some highly interesting educational activities.</p>
            <p>Through the courtesy of Mr. Louis J. Bailey, Director of the Indiana State
                    Library, I have been able to get the particulars of one of these most important
                    engines of education. In 1852 the legislature enacted a law entitled,
                    "School Tax for Libraries."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The money to
                    be used for this purpose was raised as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>There shall be assessed, collected and paid as the State and county
                            revenues are assessed, collected, and paid: <hi rend="i">First.</hi> On
                            the list of property taxable for State purposes, the sum of one-quarter
                            of one mill on each one dollar. <hi rend="i">Second</hi>, and There
                            shall be paid by every person liable to pay a poll tax for State
                            purposes, the sum of twenty-five cents: <hi rend="i">Provided</hi>, That
                            said tax shall continue for two years only.</p>
                    </quote>These moneys were to be expended for the purpose of purchasing township
                    school libraries under the direction of the State Board of Education, but no
                    sectarian work could be admitted into such libaries. These libraries were
                    divided into units of 100 or more books, and they were sent to each township in
                    the state having a sufficient population to receive one of the libaries. It
                    remained there for a limited time only, under the care of the township trustee.
                    These books were then moved to the next township and a new set of books brought
                    in. Usually each township had two sets of books every year.</p>
            <p>These libraries afforded opportunity to the boys and girls and the grown people
                    of the state of Indiana to read carefully selected works of history, literature,
                    science and philosophy, and thus engendered a love of knowledge among our people
                    which would otherwise have been impossible to secure.</p>
            <p>I sometimes think that these peripatetic libraries did more <list type="footnotes">

                    professors, teachers, historians, and politicians, for which the state
                    subsequently became so renowned, than any other educational force.</p>
            <p>By one boy, particularly, these opportunities to read good books were thoroughly
                    enjoyed. The histories, the literary works, and the scientific volumes which I
                    had the privilege of reading in my early years, I now value as one of the most
                    important of the educational facilities which I enjoyed.</p>
            <p>While the larger cities and towns of Indiana had free public schools in the
                    decade from 1850 to 1860, the outlying country districts were not thus blessed.
                    What facilities we did have were known as subscription schools. A group of
                    parents interested in having a school, after selecting a teacher, would go about
                    among the people in the neighborhood and get the number of pupils from each home
                    which would be sent to this school. The tuition fees were moderate, the pay of
                    the teacher small, and the general conditions of the schools were very much like
                    those portrayed by Edward Eggleston in <hi rend="i">The Hoosier
                    Schoolmaster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was well acquainted with the Hoosier dialect of southern Indiana long before
                        <hi rend="i">The Hoosier Schoolmaster</hi> was published, which fact enabled
                    me to read it with entire ease and understanding. Edward Eggleston was born near
                    the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> in southern Indiana. I made the acquaintance
                    of Edward Eggleston when I came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1883. He was a member of the Cosmos Club at that time. A few
                    years later he returned to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>
                    </placeName>, near his birthplace, and there spent the remainder of his days.</p>
            <p>These subscription schools were not held every year, and none of the schoolhouses
                    in which they were held was near my own home. Most of them were held during the
                    winter months and often swollen streams and impassable roads made it impossible
                    for children to go a mile and a half or two miles to school. The usual duration
                    of these schools was about three months, and with the frequent interruptions,
                    above described, the full value of the school term was not always received. One
                    factor, however, in this interrupted scheme of study, to which I have just
                    alluded, was the use of McGuffey's <hi rend="i">Readers</hi> from the
                    first to the fifth inclusive, according to the grade of the pupil. McGuffey had
                    a distinct talent for selecting appropriate themes for his <hi rend="i">Readers.</hi> They reflected the kind of education that learned men appreciated
                    in those <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-024-2-029"/> days. There was a touch of the
                    bombastic and oratorical in the selections, which probably would not be found in
                    the readers of today. The stories, however, carried a great message to the boys
                    and girls of southern Indiana. McGuffey was a professor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Miami</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, situated near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, just a few miles beyond the Indiana line. Later he became
                    professor at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Just lately there has been a great revival among the McGuffeyites,
                    especially in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, who claimed him so long as one of their most distinguished
                    citizens. McGuffey Clubs have been formed and a McGuffey magazine, <hi rend="i">The McGuffeyite</hi>, has been established at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> by those old pupils of his whom he so greatly entertained and
                    instructed in their youth. The same publishing firm that printed
                    McGuffey's <hi rend="i">Readers</hi> also printed Ray's <hi rend="i">Arithmetic</hi>, which was a co-worker with McGuffey's <hi rend="i">Readers</hi> in the instruction I received in my early days.</p>
            <p>The backwoods Hoosier had no systematic grade training as the boy of the present
                    day has. The pupils were grouped into classes more on account of age than from
                    any other factor, so that there were perhaps five classes reading in
                    McGuffey's <hi rend="i">Readers</hi>, extending from those just
                    entering school to those who were just leaving the school. The school buildings
                    were all one-room schools, with rude benches along the side, and a stove in the
                    middle of the room. The teacher was usually the janitor, although sometimes she
                    appointed some of the older and larger boys for this purpose. The fuel was
                    always wood, cut and hauled by the patrons of the school.</p>
            <p>When I was nine years of age an important event happened in the subscription
                    schools, near the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a mile and a half distant from my home. We secured as our teacher
                    a graduate of Antioch College, taught by the great Horace Mann himself. Her name
                    was Susanna Way. She was a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>, from near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>. My
                    older sister, later Dr. Elizabeth Corbett, had spent a year at Antioch College
                    and had made the acquaintance of Miss Way, and through the efforts of my sister
                    she was induced to come into the community and undertake this school. It was for
                    a longer period than most of the subscription schools, lasting fully six months.
                    It was my good fortune to read McGuffey's <hi rend="i">Fifth
                    Reader</hi> and to study Ray's <hi rend="i">Third Part of
                    Arithmetic</hi> under this wonderful teacher.</p>
            <p>After this experience, I attended only two additional school <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-024-2-030"/> terms, one with John Brazelton as a teacher, in my
                    twelfth or thirteenth year, lasting about six months, and one in my seventeenth
                    year, lasting about an equal time.</p>
            <p>Although there was a paucity of learning in schools in the backwoods, there were
                    other means of education which I consider far more important, and of which I had
                    the benefit. My father was one of the original abolitionists, as they were
                    called. He did not believe in human slavery. Both my paternal and my maternal
                    ancestors (the Maxwells), who lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> after the Revolutionary War, having warrants for the entry of land
                    (at that time in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>), left <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, the Maxwells in 1809, and the Wileys in 1816, and moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, near the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, in order to get
                    away from slavery. My father subscribed to the <hi rend="i">National Era</hi>, a
                    free-soil paper, published at that time in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. During the early fifties Harriet Beecher Stowe published <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> as a serial in the <hi rend="i">National Era.</hi> We had only one mail a week, namely on Friday. Someone
                    usually went to the village for the mail, but whoever it was had strict orders
                    from my father not to open the pages of the <hi rend="i">National Era</hi> until
                    the day's work on the farm was done, the evening meal completed, and
                    the family had gathered around the fireside for the opening of the mail. My
                    father did the reading, and there was more than rapt attention given to the
                    story of Uncle Tom. Alternately we were laughing at the witticisms of Topsy, and
                    the next moment weeping at the cruelty of Legree. This was education of the
                    lasting sort, and was fully imbibed by all members of the family.</p>
            <p>My father, although a man of limited means, nevertheless was a subscriber to the
                        <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly</hi> because of its pronounced anti-slavery
                    attitude. It was there I learned of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> College and of the great literary lights of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName>, James Russell <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Edward Everett
                    Hale, and other worthies. It was with keen delight that I read their articles.
                    Never for a moment did I harbor the least expectation that I should become a
                    student at such a renowned institution.</p>
            <p>Finally the Civil War came on. I was in my sixteenth year when <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> was elected President, and in my seventeenth year the war broke
                    out. My father was too old to become a soldier, and I was too young. However, we
                    both joined a company of Indiana militia. We were mustered in as a cavalry <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-024-2-031"/> regiment. The <geogName>Ohio
                    river</geogName> was looked upon as the deadline between the North and the
                    South. It so happened that that part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> immediately across the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> was a hot
                    bed of secessionists. When <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a candidate for the presidency in 1860, he received only six
                    votes in the whole of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Trimble county</region>
                    </placeName>. Those who had been friends prior to the war became enemies, and
                    there was no commerce between the two banks of the river. We were made a company
                    of cavalry particularly because the services which we were to render the state
                    were largely of a patrol character along the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>.</p>
            <p>In 1863 I had reached an age, being then in my nineteenth year, which was
                    critical in the choice of my profession. On both sides of my family those who
                    led a so-called professional life chose, generally, the profession of medicine.
                    My ambition was to become a physician. I was deeply impressed with the fact that
                    a successful physician should be an educated man. On the ninth of April of 1863
                    at noon I announced to my father that I had chosen medicine as my profession and
                    that I was tired of dirt farming. I further announced my determination, with his
                    permission, to enter <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, which was only about five miles distant from our farm, and
                    situated on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. Father made no objection, nor
                    did he offer any assistance. He simply said, "It is all right, son; go
                    ahead with your plan."</p>
            <p>Dressed in plain homespun, grown, spun, woven, and tailored on the farm, wearing
                    rough cowhide shoes, made by the village shoemaker, and with no baggage but my
                    ambition, I started across fields and through valleys to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was about two o'clock in the afternoon when the spires
                    of the church and the college came into view. I did not know a soul in the
                    village or in the college. My heart failed me as the village came into view. I
                    sat down under a beautiful maple tree, which was just coming into leaf. I became
                    two persons and entered into an earnest discussion with myself. First the farm
                    boy spoke. These were the sentiments he uttered: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>All the education you have had has fitted you solely for being a farm
                            boy. You have the reputation of being the best plow boy in the vicinity.
                            You have also mastered the difficult problem of dropping corn [as it was
                            done in those days by hand]; though you have never studied physics you
                            have learned practically that, in dropping corn, you should not aim at
                            the exact place where the rows cross each other, but drop the corn
                            apparently two inches before this point is reached. Experience has
                            taught you that <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-024-2-032"/> being in motion,
                            corn thus dropped will fall correctly in the center of the row. Why not
                            turn back home and continue the work for which your training has fitted
                            you?</p>
                    </quote>This was the substance of the argument of the farm boy. Next spoke the
                    expectant physician. This is the tenor of his argument: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I hope to be a doctor. To that end I need a lot of education before my
                            medical studies begin. Latin, especially, is the language of the
                            physician. I know nothing of it now. Should I turn back home and become
                            a farm boy again I shall never know anything about it. If I abandon my
                            present purpose of going to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                            </placeName> College it will be the end of my training. I know I shall
                            be a spectacle among the well-groomed and highly cultured professors and
                            students of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                            </placeName>. I know my garb will excite the risibilities of the ladies
                            in the village, and probably of the students. I do not know how to
                            address a professor or a college president. I shall be subjected to all
                            kinds of indignities by reason of my clothes and my lack of culture.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>When both sides had spoken, a vote was called for. Both the farm boy and the
                    future physician voted to go ahead and not turn my back on a college career.</p>
            <p>I had read in the township library about Caesar crossing the Rubicon and Napoleon
                    scaling the Alps. I decided that the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> was my
                    Rubicon and the high hills adjoining it on which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College was built were my Alps. I did not expect either to cross
                    the Rubicon or to scale the Alps, but I did determine to have them near at hand.</p>
            <p>When I entered the village I felt completely lost. As I walked along on this warm
                    April day, I saw, through an open window, a young boy studying. I went up to the
                    window and accosted him. I said: "I want to enter <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. How shall I do it?" The boy was at once
                    interested in what I said. He replied: "You must call on Dr. [James]
                    Wood, the president." To me this was a terrible ordeal. I hesitated. He
                    appreciated my embarrassment. Putting down his books, he said, "I will
                    go with you."</p>
            <p>That boy was Samuel Wilson Elliot. He was also preparing to enter the freshman
                    class in September. We became classmates. At the end of the sophomore year he
                    left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> and finished his academic studies at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Jefferson. He became a useful Presbyterian minister. I never
                    saw him again until the summer of 1912, when I was stumping Indiana advocating
                    the candidacy of Woodrow Wilson for the <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-024-2-033"/>
                    presidency. I spoke at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the evening. Mr. Charles B. Phelps, a friend of my Purdue days,
                    had invited the citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> to meet me at his house after the speech. There I met once more the
                    boy who first welcomed me to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>I had not been two minutes in Dr. Wood's presence until all my fear of
                    professors, presidents and college students vanished. I felt completely at home.
                    President Wood asked me a few questions as to what I had studied. I told him I
                    had finished Algebra, Ray's <hi rend="i">Third Part of Arithmetic</hi>,
                    had read Ancient History, understood the principles of English grammar, and
                    could speak, with some effort, the English language, although naturally I used
                    the Hoosier dialect. Dr. Wood told me I could not enter college, but that they
                    maintained a preparatory school which I could enter. With all my doubts thus
                    removed, I walked back home, reaching there in time for the evening meal.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile I had engaged a room in which to live. I had before this received from
                    a cousin a tuition script issued to David Harvey Maxwell, a brother of my
                    grandfather at the time <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> was started in 1827. My father had no money to pay my board, so I
                    decided to keep bachelor's hall. The next day my father hitched up the
                    two-horse wagon, loaded a few articles of furniture, an abandoned cooking stove,
                    a bedstead with its accoutrements, some firewood, and drove me to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where I installed a simple housekeeping, doing my own cooking and
                    dish-washing. There I remained for four years and three months. During the three
                    months training in the preparatory school I acquired a sufficient amount of
                    Latin and Greek to enter the freshman class in the autumn of 1863. I was now
                    fully launched on my collegiate career. In June, 1867, I became the proud
                    possessor of a diploma, authorizing me to enter the community of scholars and
                    educated men as a full-fledged Bachelor of Arts.</p>
            <p>Every Saturday morning during the school year I got up early, walked home for
                    breakfast, and did a full day's work upon the farm, for which my father
                    paid me one dollar, the amount of the weekly room rent for my bachelor quarters.
                    During each vacation I worked on the farm and received from my father a small
                    sum of money with which to buy my clothing and the necessary books. My father
                    and mother were both present at my graduation. After the exercises we drove <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-024-2-034"/> home in our farm wagon and the next day I
                    entered the harvest field and continued to work on the farm for my father during
                    the summer months.</p>
            <p>I owe a great deal of my training to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It occurred at the most trying time for any college, especially
                    those on the border line of the Confederacy. Therefore, the principal clientele
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College was from the South. This contingent was entirely
                    eliminated. Nevertheless, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College never closed its doors during the whole course of the Civil
                    War. The latter part of my freshman year and nearly the whole of my sophomore
                    year were occupied by my service in Sherman's army and the physical
                    breakdown resulting therefrom. Although a good part of my sophomore year J was
                    an invalid at home, I managed by private study to keep ahreast of my classes and
                    by the end of the sophomore year was again in residence. To Mr. Henry Thompson,
                    my tutor in Latin and Greek; to Dr. James Wood, the President of the College; to
                    Professor J. B. Garritt, my professor in Greek; to Professor S. Harrison
                    Thompson, my professor in mathematics; and to Dr. John W. Scott, my professor in
                    the sciences, I owe the greater part of the debt which I shall never be able to
                    repay to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. These teachers, who insisted upon thoroughness rather than
                    multiplicity of studies, and the fundamental ground work that I received in
                    mathematics, in the natural sciences and in Latin and Greek languages have been
                    an unfailing help to me in all my career.</p>
            <p>The question was now how to raise the funds for my professional training. At this
                    time there was only one avenue open, namely to teach in some public school. Late
                    in 1867 through the intervention of a trustee of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, by a letter informing me that there was a vacancy in the
                    public schools of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Crown Point</settlement>,
                            <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake county</region>
                    </placeName>, bordering on Lake <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, I made preparations immediately to leave home and apply in person
                    for this position. My father gave me a small sum of money and his own silver
                    watch. These were the sole assets which I had. When I reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crown Point</settlement>
                    </placeName> my money was all spent except a fifty cent "shin
                    plaster." Silver currency was unknown at that time. There was only the
                    scrip of the Civil War. I applied as soon as I arrived, to the county
                    superintendent of schools, Mr. W. W. Cheshire. He received me in a very friendly
                    way, but my heart failed me when he said, "I <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-024-2-035"/> am sorry, but the position in the schools in this
                    town, for which you came to apply, has already been filled." Here I
                    was, a youth of twenty-three, 250 miles from home, with only a fifty cent piece
                    of paper money and my father's silver watch as assets. Mr. Cheshire
                    observed my embarrassment. I told him that I could do only one thing. I would
                    walk into the country and see if I could not hire myself to some farmer to help
                    with the autumn harvest, as I had only fifty cents and had had no breakfast.
                    Meanwhile, Mr. Cheshire had asked me a great many questions in regard to my
                    training. I found being a pretty good Latin and Greek scholar in this region was
                    a poor basis for making a living. He had inquired, however, in regard to modern
                    languages. I had at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>, not in the college, but in collaboration with one of my
                    classmates, J. C. Burt, acquired a speaking knowledge of German, and this seemed
                    to please Mr. Cheshire very much. He said, "At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, ten miles south of here, on the banks of the Kankakee, they are
                    building a new schoolhouse with four rooms. This schoolhouse will not be
                    finished until about the middle of November. I am a candidate for clerk of this
                    county at the approaching October election. There is one township in this
                    county, settled almost exclusively by German Catholics who all vote the
                    Democratic ticket. I am a candidate on the Republican ticket. I shall be very
                    glad to take you to my own home if you will go with me to canvass the voters in
                    this township. They do not speak English, but I am sure they will be glad to
                    have some one come to them who can speak German. I will go with you, but I
                    don't want you to ask any one of these farmers to vote for me, as they
                    all vote the other ticket. I want to call on every farmer in the township. It
                    may take two or three weeks. I do not need to go to any other township in the
                    county because they are all overwhelmingly Republican." I gladly
                    accepted his offer, and I enjoyed talking to these farmers, and they were glad
                    to have some one who spoke German to them. I asked them about the crops they
                    grew, the difficulties they had, if any, in tilling the soil. I told them I was
                    a farmer's boy, had always worked on the farm, and I manifested a deep
                    sympathy with their problems and their labors. If it was at meal time they
                    always invited us to eat with them, so that I still held my fifty cents in scrip
                    in my pocket. When the votes were counted it so happened that Mr. Cheshire who
                    had never said a word or asked me to say a word <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-024-2-036"/> about his being a candidate for county clerk,
                    carried this township by an overwhelming vote. Later I received the appointment
                    of principal of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
                    </placeName> school. The public funds lasted for about six months, then a
                    subscription school was provided for, for an additional three months. I received
                    sixty dollars a month from the public moneys, and a little less than that from
                    the subscription school. At the end, after having paid all my expenses, and
                    having bought my first tailor-made suit, I was the proud possessor of one
                    hundred dollars. The first use of this enormous wealth was a visit to the city
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to see Mr. A. S. Peck, a classmate of mine at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was studying for the Presbyterian ministry in the theological
                    seminary in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>During the winter at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, I "read medicine," as the saying is, with the
                    local doctor, and made great progress in my medical studies. Soon after that I
                    received notice of my appointment to teach the lower classes in Latin in what is
                    now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, Indiana. I began my career as a Latin teacher in
                    September, 1868, and immediately entered as a student at the first session of
                    the Medical College established by the State University of Indiana at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> that autumn. I attended the first session, and for three years all
                    the sessions of this institution while teaching Latin every morning up until one
                    o'clock, and doing my medical work thereafter.</p>
            <p>In the fourth year of my medical work I taught in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School, at a considerably increased salary over the eight
                    hundred dollars per annum which I received from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. In 1872 I received my diploma as a Doctor of Medicine, and
                    then deemed myself ready for my professional career.</p>
            <p>But fate was unwilling that my ambition should be fulfilled. My teacher of
                    chemistry in the medical school was Ryland T. Brown, state geologist and chemist
                    of Indiana, and professor of natural science in what is now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. In 1872 Dr. Brown was appointed chemist to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Department of Agriculture in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and resigned his professorship in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Medical School to accept this new position. A short time
                    thereafter I was greatly surprised and somewhat embarrassed at receiving from
                    the trustees of the Indiana Medical College a communication appointing me to be
                    professor of chemistry in the college from <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-024-2-037"/>
                    which I had just graduated. It so happened that, because of the chemical
                    training I got in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in the Medical School, Dr. Brown had honored me with an
                    appointment as assistant to him in the preparation of his lectures. For some
                    reason he considered me the best student in chemistry in the Medical School.
                    Naturally I felt honored by the action of the Board of Trustees. I felt,
                    however, that my training in chemistry, although it had lasted about six years
                    altogether, was wholly inadequate to qualify me as a professor thereof. My
                    training had been entirely from the book and the lecture. I had never worked as
                    a chemist at the desk, I had never made an analysis of any product. I replied to
                    this invitation, accepting it on one condition, namely that I should have a
                    year's leave of absence before my services began. To this the trustees
                    assented, by securing a temporary professor of chemistry, who perhaps knew less
                    about it than I, if such a thing could be.</p>
            <p>Then I remembered the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly</hi> that I had read when a
                    boy between the fifties and sixties and how I had thought that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> College was so far beyond me that I had never aspired to think of
                    being a student there. The urge now came to me, "Why not go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the year's leave of absence?" No sooner
                    resolved upon than done. In going to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> I went by way of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with the idea of calling on my old professor, Dr. Brown, and
                    seeing the capital of my country. When I reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> I visited the galleries of the House and the Senate. It was my
                    great good fortune while in the Senate to hear the voice of Charles Sumner, whom
                    I had learned to love and revere as an opponent of slavery. As a result of his
                    denunciation of slavery he had been attacked by Representative Brooks of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> who beat his head into a jelly with a cane, from which Sumner never
                    entirely recovered. I do not remember on what he spoke. It was a matter of no
                    importance, but the fact that I had heard and seen him was of great importance
                    to me.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of my trip to the East I went through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was the year in which Horace Greeley was nominated for
                    President by the Democratic party. When I reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> I found Greeley was to be in that city that day. My father had been
                    a great admirer of Horace Greeley and a reader of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>, because Greeley had been one of the fiercest
                    opponents of human slavery. As a candidate of a pro-slavery party it seemed to
                        <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-024-2-038"/> me he was very much out of place.
                    Nevertheless, I determined to stay over for the day, and was rewarded by seeing
                    him pass in a carriage through the crowded streets, bowing his salutations to
                    the right and left to the applauding crowd, his long white hair waving and
                    flowing in the breeze. My impression is, although I never asked my father
                    directly in regard to it, that Greeley did not get my father's vote for
                    President.</p>
            <p>I wish that I could express to you my sensations when I reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and paid my half year's fee to enter <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> post graduate course in chemistry and allied branches. I felt that
                    I was at last in a new world, that I was becoming a part of those traditions
                    which I had gained of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> in my youth. I was soon freed from any unfavorable conception of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> professors and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> students. I found them all quite human instead of half divine. I
                    did not give my whole time to lectures and work in the laboratories of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, but from five to eight hours a day I attended lectures and
                    worked in the laboratories of qualitative and quantitative analyses. I also took
                    the course in mineralogy as a branch of chemistry. Attracted by the great fame
                    of Agassiz I took his course also in biology. Fortunately, two of the professors
                    who taught me at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> are still in the land of the living, Dr. Charles E. Munroe, and Dr.
                    Charles Loring Jackson.</p>
            <p>In entering <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> I had no intention of applying for a degree. I only wanted to learn
                    the principles and practice of chemical analyses, both qualitative and
                    quantitative. I was very much surprised therefore, when my teacher of
                    quantitative analysis, Dr. Charles E. Monroe, about six weeks before
                    commencement called me into conference and startled me with the following
                    question: "Why don't you apply for a degree?" I
                    replied, "I did not come here for the purpose of getting a degree.
                    Moreover, under the rules it is too late to apply now. The rules say, all
                    applications for a degree must be made at the -time of entry into the graduate
                    school." To which Munroe replied, "I know that, but I have
                    talked with Professor Cooke in regard to this matter. He tells me that if you
                    will make application he believes the faculty will waive the rule and admit you
                    to an examination for a degree." Soon after that Professor Cooke called
                    me into his office and told me of the conversation <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> had with him on-the matter. He appeared to be quite favorable also
                    to the plan. To me the idea <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-024-2-039"/> of having a
                    degree from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a new thrill, and it was not long until I yielded to the
                    temptation. Had I known, however, the kind of examination that I was to go
                    through I might have recoiled even from making the attempt. Evidently Munroe had
                    acquainted the faculty with the stories about my proficiency in Latin, Greek and
                    Mathematics, for I soon learned that I was to be examined in none of these
                    branches; it was understood that it was not necessary and that credit for these
                    studies would be given me. Happily, I passed all the examinations prior to the
                    final one and before the commencement arrived I also passed in my final
                    examination. The proudest day of my life was when I attended the commencement
                    exercises and when my name was called, I marched up to the platform and was
                    handed my diploma by President Eliot, the "boy president" of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. I believe that six weeks is the record for any one who
                    ever received an examination degree from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> University.</p>
            <p>I have already alluded to the fact that when one gets a degree from a college, he
                    has only qualified himself to continue as long as he lives his educational
                    activities. For four years after I felt <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> I was quite satisfied with the three diplomas I had already
                    received. But I was not satisfied to continue as a professor of chemistry. The
                    year after I left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Purdue University was opened and, much to my surprise, I was
                    called to the first professorship of chemistry in that institution. I was
                    present on the opening day in September, 1874. I arranged to keep both my
                    professorships, that is, in the Medical School, and at Purdue. For four years,
                    not having abandoned the idea entirely of becoming a physician, I held both
                    places. The proximity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the rapid transit between the two places, about an hour and a
                    half by rail, made this possible. Finally in 1878 it seemed as if I must abandon
                    my idea of becoming a physician. Following the general trend at that period, I
                    felt that my success as a professor of chemistry should be completed with some
                    instruction in a German university. Again I applied for leave of absence from
                    both my posts, and was accorded the privilege. I did not know to which
                    university I should go, but I rather favored <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Heidelberg</settlement>
                    </placeName> on account of the eminence of Bunsen then in the prime of his
                    career. Stopping at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> to attend the exposition of 1878 I met an American chemist, Edward
                    J. Hallock, who had been a year in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Berlin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, studying with <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-024-2-040"/> Hoffman, equally
                    as famous as Bunsen. He persuaded me to go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Berlin</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Berlin</settlement>
                    </placeName> a little late in the autumn. I found that all the desks in
                    Hoffmann's laboratory were occupied, so I found no place to work. My
                    friend was sympathetic with me in this and said that the chemist of the Imperial
                    Board of Health, Dr. Sell, often gave to the overflow from Hoffmann's
                    laboratory an opportunity to work in his own laboratory. The Imperial Board of
                    Health laboratory was not far from Hoffmann's. My friend took me to Dr.
                    Sell, introduced me to him, and he seemed quite anxious to give me a working
                    desk in his laboratory. This incident produced a profound impression upon me,
                    and entirely altered my career. Dr. Sell put me to work examining adulterations
                    of food under the German law. There was nothing I ever undertook that filled me
                    with such enthusiasm as this. Moreover, the first job he gave me was the study
                    of the methods of detecting and estimating adulterations in sugars and syrups.</p>
            <p>In my new environment I lost all desire to become a practicing physician. When I
                    returned to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> I was full of enthusiasm in regard to adulteration of foods and
                    drugs. I had a friend in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Dr. Vinnedge, who was a member of the Indiana State Board of
                    Health. I asked him if the Indiana Board of Health would not take up the
                    subject, and especially the adulteration of sugars and syrups in the state. I
                    proposed that if they would give me fifty dollars to buy samples, I would do the
                    chemical work in the laboratory of Purdue University myself and report the
                    result to the Board of Health. The next year, 1881, the Indiana State Board of
                    Health published my first paper on the adulteration of sugars and syrups. This
                    work two years later resulted in Commissioner Loring offering me the position of
                    chief chemist of the Department of Agriculture, the very office which Ryland T.
                    Brown occupied after he resigned his position of chemist in the Medical College.
                    It is rather surprising that two of the dominant factors in the shaping of my
                    career consisted in following Dr. Ryland T. Brown on two separate occasions.</p>

            <p>In those days, the higher courts of justice were movable affairs, traveling from
                    town to town by fixed itineraries. There was little ceremony, either in the
                    practice before the courts, or in the daily living. The rigid exclusiveness and
                    rules of reserve and privacy prevailing today had not yet arrived.</p>

                    </placeName>'s contacts, therefore, with these two young lawyers, one a
                    Democrat and the other a Republican, must have been frequent, and their hours
                    out of court marked by enlivening political discussions relating to the burning
                    issues of the day. One imagines that by the fireside of an evening, after a long
                    and vexatious day in court, the conversation must have turned on the Ordinance
                    of 1787, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Compromise, and lastly, on the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> Bill, which was the culmination of the efforts to extend slavery,
                    and the vital issue which finally brought on the Civil War. That such
                    discussions did frequently occur is evidenced by the files of old newspapers of
                    that period, and by musty letters which have recently been brought from
                    forgotten places into light.</p>
            <p>Stephen A. Douglas, too, was active in practice in the Eighth Judicial Circuit,
                    and neither side lacked for active defenders or proponents. How much these two
                    young men—Voorhees and Wilson—carried away from these
                    discussions is difficult to say, but in 1856 they became the acknowledged
                    representatives of the two different schools of political thought. At this
                    precise time both the Whig and Democratic parties <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-024-2-042"/> were disintegrating on the slavery issue, and the
                    young Republican party was then being built up by dissenters from both. Wilson
                    became a Republican, and Voorhees, whose antecedents were probably Whiggish,
                    became a Democrat. In 1856 the Democrats of the Eighth Congressional District of
                    Indiana, comprising the counties of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>, <region type="county">Warren</region>, <region type="county">Fountain</region>, <region type="county">Montgomery</region>, <region type="county">Boone</region>
               </placeName>,
                    Carroll and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clinton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, nominated Voorhees, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>, for Congress, and the Republicans nominated James Wilson, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery county</region>
                    </placeName>. At this time both men were about thirty years of age, and both
                    were practising lawyers of wide repute.</p>
            <p>The background of these two men furnishes some interesting contrasts and some
                    similarities. Both were born of prominent and well to do parents, and both had
                    been highly trained in legal and political matters. Wilson graduated from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College at the precocious age of seventeen, read law with Tilghman
                    A. Howard, took his degree at the law college of Indiana University, and fought
                    through the Mexican War from beginning to end, entering <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mexico City</settlement>
                    </placeName> with General Winfield Scott. He had been thoroughly trained in the
                    classics, in Greek and Roman literature, and in the Bible, and his speeches were
                    full of biblical and classical allusions. He had a clarion voice, and in its use
                    he could move vast audiences to sympathy and tears. He stood six feet tall, had
                    light brown hair and blue eyes, was fastidious in dress, sentimental, and of a
                    formal courtesy. He possessed unflagging industry, and absolute concentration to
                    whatever cause he espoused. Wilson was of pure Scottish blood, though his father
                    was a Kentuckian and his grandfather a Virginian.</p>
            <p>Voorhees' antecedents were not unlike those of Wilson in some respects,
                    and in others they differed. He was born of Dutch ancestry in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Butler county</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and came to Indiana at a very early age.
                    Educated at Asbury University, and trained much on the same lines as Wilson, he
                    was his equal in culture as he was in other things. Like Wilson's, his
                    mind was replete with imagery of the Bible and the classics, and he, too, had a
                    voice of singular richness, and a manner of rare persuasiveness. He was
                    fastidious in dress, and courtly in manner; stood the equal in height of Wilson,
                    and possessed an equal presence.</p>
            <p>In the month of May, 1856, Voorhees and Wilson were nominated by their respective
                    parties for Congress. Vast crowds <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-024-2-043"/> attended
                    the nomination conventions. More than twelve thousand people attended the
                    convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> which nominated Wilson, and there were probably as many attending
                    that which nominated Voorhees. From the day of their nomination the entire
                    Eighth District was engrossed in political discussion and debate, and the air
                    was replete with charges and counter charges, vituperation and praise, eloquence
                    and wit.</p>
            <p>The two candidates threw themselves into the campaign with all the ardor of
                    youth. Every community was roused to political activity; none was too remote or
                    unimportant to be overlooked. The battle raged from schoolhouse to schoolhouse,
                    from county seat to county seat, by the fireside and at the village corners.
                    Extreme bitterness marked the attitude of the press. The Democrats were
                    denounced as slave drivers, fire eaters, and law breakers; Republicans were
                    called woolly heads, fanatics and destroyers of the Union. Voorhees was
                    described by the Republican press as a demagogue, a falsifier and an ignoramus;
                    Wilson was described by the Democratic press as a temperance crank and a tricky
                    politician. There was little dignity displayed by the partisan press on either
                    side; the blows were vigorous and the lines of division sharply drawn. The
                    candidates, however, had been bosom friends from childhood, and no word
                    derogatory to the character of his opponent was spoken by either.</p>
            <p>In the midst of the campaign Voorhees issued a challenge to Wilson for a joint
                    discussion of the issues: <text>

                        <p>Being placed in nomination by our respective political friends as
                                    opposing candidates for the same office, it suggests itself to
                                    my mind as being eminently proper and right that we should
                                    discuss together in the ensuing canvass those questions and
                                    principles which now so deeply engage the public attention. With
                                    this view I propose to you that we meet at your earliest
                                    convenience and arrange our appointments and the terms of
                                    discussion, preparatory to going before the people of this
                                    district in a candid, fair and friendly way for their suffrages.</p>
                        <p>Hoping to hear from you soon on this subject, I am, with
                                    sentiments of unchanging personal regard,</p>

            <p>The challenge was accepted without comment by James Wilson, and the agreement was
                    fully formulated as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>At a subsequent meeting of the two candidates it was agreed that the joint

                    </placeName>, and on the dates fixed, they took place. These meetings were in
                    the nature of triumphal processions, the adherents of both speakers flocking to
                    them in vast numbers with rival bands and processions. The audiences were afire
                    with partisan zeal, and vociferous in their expression. People by the thousands,
                    not only from various parts of Indiana, but from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, followed the speakers from place to place.</p>
            <p>In those days there were no shorthand reporters, and only speeches written out in
                    full were afterwards printed. Literal reports were not made. All the people
                    heard all of the joint discussions, and their publication was not essential to
                    intelligent understanding of the issues. So far as this joint discussion is
                    concerned, only general outlines and pertinent phrases here and there can be
                    found among newspaper files. From these files, however, one may gain a good

                    it was admitted that Wilson lost something of his usual ease and fluency in his

                    brevet rank of Brigadier General. When <placeName>

                    front to defend the act in a series of speeches through the eastern states, and
                    these great speeches were published in full by the eastern press. At the close
                    of the war, Wilson resumed the practice of the law in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and again identified himself with politics. But the radical
                    element led by Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Summer had seized control of the
                    Republican party, and Wilson, a <placeName>

                    violent wave of radicalism had spent itself.</p>
            <p>But he was fated never to return again to his native country. He was stricken
                    down by yellow fever in 1867, and died at his post in Caracas at the early age
                    of 42 years. The important position which he occupied in the public eye at that
                    time was evidenced by the editorial comments of the <placeName>

                        <p>Mr. Wilson was in the strongest sense of the term a self made man, and
                            grew to be one of the ablest and best beloved public men of Indiana by
                            the sheer force of his native ability, genius, strong individualism and

                            He was not so much a real politician as a patriot. As a popular orator
                            he had few equals. A rare grace of manner, persuasiveness, vehement and
                            earnest eloquence, and a nature that kindled into the white heat of
                            eloquence at the slightest provocation were his. He had the indefinable
                            quality of genius, and he had the virtue of industry.</p>

            <p rend="center">ELECTION CONDITIONS IN INDIANA</p>
            <p>In the campaigns from 1876 to 1892, the chairman of the two national party
                    committees had a very important role to play. The tone of each campaign depended
                    upon the kind of men at the head of these committees. When the presidential
                    campaign could be conducted by a man and a boy in the lobby of a hotel with a
                    small waiting room, the commandant of the campaign was usually a banker. August
                    Belmont was chairman of the Democratic forces for years. With Edwin D. Morgan,
                    chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1872, passed the last of the
                    banker type. His duties were largely those which later devolved upon the
                    treasurer. Morgan was considered very proficient in the collection of campaign
                    funds, but the sum which was raised for the campaign of 1872 would have seemed
                    rather small twenty years later.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The factor which played an
                    important part in the choice of many of the chairmen of this period was their
                    purse. The wealthy chairman with large business associations and high social
                    position was in touch with the rich men of the country and could solicit funds
                    from them on a basis of genial equality.</p>
            <p>In the presidential elections down to 1888, the elections in October in several
                    of the states were thought to have a very powerful influence upon the subsequent
                    elections in November. The results in October were considered prophetic. Of all
                    these October states, Indiana as a very doubtful state was predominant in
                    importance because of the ebb and flow of confidence in the respective parties
                    in the pivotal state of <placeName>

                            campaign fund in Indiana for 1872 did not exceed $250,000,

                    state. It became a popular slogan that "the way Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName> goes so goes the nation." The pendulum oscillated
                    portentously in this period with the exception of the doubtful election of 1876.</p>
            <p>On August 13,1876, Mr. Hayes wrote in his diary: <text>
                  <body>
                     <div type="diary">
                        <p>Governor [Oliver P.] Morton regards the situation as grave; that
                                    if Indiana is Democratic in October our chance is not one in ten
                                    of success in the country in November; that if we carry Indiana
                                    in October, our chances of carrying the country in November are
                                    forty-nine in fifty; in short, that we lose the Presidency in
                                    November if we lose Indiana in October. … He detailed
                                    the figures of elections since 1860. He showed the closeness of
                                    the State. … I said: "and now the
                                    remedy." He, after some further talk said: <hi rend="i">"Money and speakers!</hi> Money to pay men to
                                    travel and organize—to print and circulate
                                    documents," etc., etc. To my question, how much is
                                    needed to do the work required to carry the State, he replied
                                    …. one hundred thousand dollars. I asked how much is
                                    generally used. He replied: "Four years ago we had from
                                    outside the State fifty-five thousand
                                    dollars."… On the whole his talk was not
                                    encouraging. The use of money I have little faith in, and I am
                                    confident that no such large sum can be raised. I mean to go
                                    through cheerfully and firmly and with clean hands.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Indiana virtually became a raging sea of oratory. Speakers, transparencies,
                    processions, mass meetings, roorback and boodle stories all had their part to
                    play in the canvass. For and under cover of this scenic claptrap was expended a
                    great deal of money by the two parties. The election laws of Indiana were an
                    open door to illegal practices. William H. Barnum travelled over the state
                    distributing money and telegraphing in cipher for "seven more
                        mules."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Various estimates were given of the
                    amount spent by each party within the state but too frequently they are made by
                    the organ of the opposing party.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> We have the Republican
                    needs estimated by Oliver P. Morton as $100,000. Whatever may have

            <p>Indiana was a very important post of danger in 1880 as she had been in 1876. The

            <p>The most active individual for the Republicans in Indiana was Stephen W. Dorsey,

                    Mr. Dorsey said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            of it is due to John C. New and Colonel W. W. Dudley. All this money was

            <p>That a great deal of money was sent into Indiana by the Republicans can easily be
                    gleaned from letters by Levi P. Morton, chairman of a special finance committee,
                    to Senator Dorsey in Indiana, in which he notifies Dorsey that he is sending

                            said, "We have the best organization we ever had and if we have

            <p>The Democrats were also alive to the situation in Indiana. Chairman Barnum was
                    again active within the state. The choice of William H. English as the
                    Democratic vice-presidential candidate was partly influenced by the fact that he
                    was one of the richest men in Indiana and by the understanding that he would
                    contribute generously.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Wrote George William Curtis,
                    "…. one of the chief qualifications of a candidate is the
                    'bar'l.' Many of the highest offices are now
                    practically for sale, and the rich men buy civil positions as they once bought
                    commissions in the English army."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Mr. English
                    received many letters every day containing requests for contributions. It no
                    doubt seemed to Mr. English that they not only wanted him to tap his
                    "bar'l" but to knock both ends out. However, the
                    "bar'l' was fairly tight and the leak let the money
                    seep out so gradually that only ten thousand dollars had been lost at the end of
                    the Indiana campaign.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> A member of the Democratic State
                    Committee of Indiana said, "English is naturally a miser in the fullest
                    sense of the term. His beggarly contribution of $10,000 came in
                    dribbles and grudgingly…. while the Republicans were having men to
                    make a personal canvass of every township…. Mr. English was saving

            <p>William H. Barnum, though seventy years old, again assumed the management of the
                    Democratic campaign, but really only in an advisory capacity. It was understood
                    that the active duties of the canvass were to fall to Calvin S. Brice as
                    chairman of the National Campaign Committee. Barnum was ill during the entire
                    campaign and died after a prolonged illness on April 30,1889. Mr. Brice was the
                    real leader. Calvin S. Brice, or "Calvin $ Brice"
                    as his name was often written during the campaign, was an <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> lawyer with only a comfortable living in 1882 but with a keen mind
                    and industry. In 1888 he had risen to the position of a recognized leader in
                    American financial and railway circles. As in the case of Jones for the
                    Republicans in 1884, the choice of Brice as chairman of the National Campaign
                    Committee and as the real leader was actuated by the desire to get a man who
                    could and would make large contributions to the campaign fund from his own purse
                    and through his personal position and influence be able to get others to do the
                    same. However, Mr. Brice had a very fertile brain and far surpassed Jones as a
                    chairman. It was in this campaign that he made a tour of the western states to
                    sound them as to their position on the Mills bill and got the title of
                    "Rainbow Chaser." It was thought that he should have
                    concentrated his attentions upon the doubtful northern states. His work gave
                    evidence of results in 1890 and 1892. Brice was made chairman of the National
                    Committee on June 12, 1889. His chief aid in 1888 was Senator A. P. Gorman, of <placeName>

            <p>President Cleveland issued an order on July 14, 1886 saying, "The

            <p>It was this fourth direction that attracted most attention and brought down upon
                    the head of the author the scalding adverse criticism of a public opinion that
                    was aroused and becoming militant. The reformer, George William Curtis, wrote,
                    "In Indiana, the doubtful state, the result shows nothing about
                    protection, or party sympathy, or preference of candidates, but simply that the
                    'floaters' were bribed to vote the Republican ticket, as they
                    might next time be bought to vote against it."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                    The number of "floaters" or doubtful voters in Indiana who
                    were to de divided into "blocks of five" was estimated to be
                    about twenty-five or thirty thousand.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> When one remembers
                    the Republican majority in that state in 1888 was only a little more than
                    twenty-two thousand votes, the value of a vote in this state, so much desired by
                    both parties, is evident.</p>
            <p>The prolonged discussion of the questionable methods of the political

                            discussion of election conditions which would result in a demand for
                            ballot or election reform it is possible that too much emphasis has been
                            placed on the disageeable features to the exclusion of others. In this
                            it is probably true to the form of the period in which these elections
                            occurred. Indiana as an October state to 1884, as a doubtful and close
                            state during the whole period, would naturally have attention centered
                            on her and would receive a great amount of publicity. However, that
                            there was corruption of elections in this state considered so important
                            by both parties there can be no doubt. Other explanations of the state
                            voting so regularly with those favoring the successful candidate are
                            that it is due to the superior political intelligence of the people, to
                            a larger and fuller vote being cast owing to the great interest of the
                            people in politics, and that it was more or less accidental, i.e., they
                            merely stumbled in the right direction, and yet were honest. The true
                            explanation most probably does not lie in any one of the above but in a
                            combination of all. That the conditions portrayed in the foregoing pages
                            were those which resulted in the urgent demand for ballot and election
                            reform within the state there can be no doubt.</item>

                    public mind could not but have its influence. Just as the practice of Hubbellism
                    in 1880 and 1882 served to call forth agitation and a resistless demand for
                    civil service reform, so the use of such large sums of money and the work of
                    such men as Dudley with his "blocks of five" in 1888, gave
                    impetus to the long growing demand for ballot and election reform which was soon
                    to culminate in constructive legislation.</p>
            <p rend="center">BALLOT REFORM IN INDIANA</p>
            <p>Until the late eighties abuses and corruption in elections were taken somewhat as
                    a matter of course, as an unavoidable if not a necessary evil. At least public
                    opinion had not crystallized in favor of anything like a thorough ballot reform
                    or corrupt practice act. There had always been a reform element and it was
                    growing in numbers, strength, and influence. Some abortive attempts at ballot
                    reform had been made prior to 1888. The campaign of 1888 was so flagrant in its
                    abuses that it was felt that preventive measures were necessary and an insistent
                    demand arose that something be done.</p>
            <p>It was thought that most of the corruption and abuses were at least facilitated
                    by, if they were not due to, the balloting system. During the colonial period in
                    America the old <hi rend="i">viva voce</hi> method of voting was replaced by the
                    method of voting by the unofficial ballot. As early as 1643 <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> had adopted the corn and bean ballot; that method like so many of
                    its successors may have been more convenient, but it was not secret. This was
                    succeeded by the written ballot which had to give way to the printed ballot,
                    with the increase in population. These ballots came to be printed on various
                    colored paper and in 1839 the state required the ballots to be deposited in the
                    ballot box open and unfolded. Certainly there was no secrecy provided under such
                    a system as this. In 1851 the liberals succeeded in obtaining a law providing
                    that the ballots be placed in an envelope. Still the ballots were unofficially
                    furnished by private parties.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                        <p>The law of the State guarantees to every voter the right to vote a secret

                            trick or device, by which he is deprived of such right is unlawful.
                            While the law gives the voter this right, it does not compel him to
                            exercise it. He may if he chooses mark his ticket so as to identify it,
                            or, for that matter, show it to whom he pleases, and if he does so of

            <p>The problem was to protect the honest voter's ballot from invalidation
                    by a purchased ballot or by a ballot cast by a man who, because of the shortness
                    of his term of residence or in some cases because he was not a resident of
                    Indiana at all, had no right to vote.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Moreover, under the
                    existing system the stuffing of the ballot box was comparatively easy as the
                    ballots were furnished by irresponsible party committees and no count kept 6f
                    the number furnished. Bedlam more or less reigned about the polling places.
                    Nominations could be made at the last moment, making investigation and publicity
                    almost impossible. The thought was that most of the abuses were caused by the
                    absence of a compulsory secret voting system. The vote of a
                    "floater" or unscrupulous citizen could be purchased and the
                    purchaser could see that the goods were delivered as bought.</p>

                    that the ballots were furnished by the state and supplied to electors on

                    abuses which we have noted by providing that "The ballots shall be of
                    uniform size and of the same quality and color of paper, and sufficiently thick

            <p>All spoiled ballots must be destroyed and a count kept of the number disposed of

                    provides that each voting place shall have a passage with a railing, rope, or
                    wire on each side commencing fifty feet away from and leading to the polling

            <p>There are serious objections to the party-column ballot. It is long and unwieldy.
                    One can tell whether or not one is voting the straight party ticket by the
                    length of time taken to vote. Probably, the chief objection is that it makes
                    independent voting difficult and encourages straight party voting. In Indiana
                    the independent voter must mark for every name while loyal party men or women
                    merely put one cross in the party emblem circle. The <placeName>

                    have been equally to the credit of the Republican party. The most important fact
                    is that the reform was adopted. The days of the ticket peddler and the
                    "vest-pocket ticket" were over. The "blocks of
                    five" system could no longer work so smoothly and openly. The buyer of
                    votes could not be absolutely sure that his money would accomplish what he
                    desired. Although it did not abolish corruption in elections it was a step in
                    the right direction. A few of the states passed corrupt practice acts and others
                    have followed their example. This legislation could not but cause the political
                    managers to alter their methods. Legitimate expenses have increased, owing
                    partly to an enlarged "educational" campaign; partly to an
                    increase in population and the attempt to reach every fire-side in the land with
                    the aid of such devices as free mail delivery in the rural districts. Corruption
                    and election abuse, however, have been lessened and the ballot made more
                    representative of the will and sentiment of the people. The development of the
                    primary election, the application to it of safeguards similar to those in force
                    in the final elections, and the use of the voting machine are but additional
                    efforts to extend the reform inaugurated in 1889.</p>

                    another there that I am offering today.</p>
            <p>A Japanese writer in the <hi rend="i">Saturday Evening Post</hi> began his
                    article by saying, "History is a romance on a big scale….
                    The story of Abraham <placeName>

                    unique story, abounding in human interest, only possible in such a vast country
                    as America." It seems to me that if the teacher and student read
                    history in that spirit it would be an enjoyable play.</p>
            <p>Ten years before <placeName>

                    </placeName> was cut off from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>, the first county organized in Indiana Territory, and two years
                    before the government survey, John Sprinkle and his family settled on a
                    beautiful piece of <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> front, now in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick county</region>
                    </placeName>. In the month of June, 1807, General W. Johnston, who was a very
                    prominent man in the early history of the territory and state, and known as the
                    "Father of Freemasonry in Indiana," entered this land, and in
                    the year 1812, John Sprinkle, as the assignee of Johnston, received a patent for
                    it. At the time of Sprinkle's settlement, June, 1803, it was the site
                    of an Indian village.</p>

                    Wilkinson. As the county records fail to show any land entry or conveyance of
                    land to Bailey Anderson it seems evident that he was a squatter, or possibly a
                    tenant; a tree that he lived in when he <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-024-2-067"/>
                    first landed in Indiana territory was locally known as
                    "Bailey's Roost"; the remains of this old tree stump
                    may still be seen on the farm of George H. Vanada, near the <geogName>Ohio
                    river</geogName>, in section 12 township 7 south, range 8 west.</p>
            <p>At a court of common pleas held at the house of Bailey Anderson on October
                    18,1813, Price McCallister, James Marrs and Bailey Anderson were the judges, N.
                    C. Claypoole, clerk, and Samuel R. Marrs, sheriff. At this court William Prince
                    and G. R. C. Sullivan were admitted as attorneys for <placeName>

            <p>The circuit riding lawyers and court officials of that time rode horseback,
                    following the old trails and bridle paths over the hills and through the
                    forests. In one of the trials of that time there were twenty-two men impaneled
                    on the jury. The complaints and indictments were usually actions for debt,
                    trespass, larceny, adultery, challenging, slander, divorce, resisting process,
                    and assault and battery. The lawyers appearing were a Mr. Triplet, John Pitcher,

                    Charles I. Battelle, Amos Clark, Samuel Hall, T. J. Evans, J. A. Brackenridge,
                    G. R. C. Sullivan, and others. The early judges include James Marrs, J. R. E.
                    Goodlet, Benjamin Parke, G. R. C. Sullivan and Isaac <placeName>

                    defendants—their descendants would not care to have their legal
                    entanglements made public.</p>
            <p>At one of the first courts it was ordered that a special court be held at Major
                    Hugh McGary's on the first Monday of June, <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-024-2-068"/> next. This special court met at Hugh
                    McGary's on June 7, 1813. The ferry belonging to the heirs of William
                    McFadden, deceased, was taxed at four dollars for the year 1813; Jacob
                    Weinmiller's ferry at four dollars. The license for this latter ferry
                    was issued by Governor William Henry Harrison on November 6, 1805; I believe it
                    is the oldest document recorded in the county of <placeName>

            <p>On July 19, 1813, court was held at the house of Bailey Anderson and a grand jury

                    Another special term of court was held at <placeName>

                    of court was held at the house of Bailey Anderson and election inspectors were
                    appointed as follows:—George Tobin for Tobin township; Ratliff Boon

                    parties for wolf scalps. Daniel Lynn was recommended to the Governor as a
                    suitable person for justice of the peace. N. S. Claypoole was allowed
                    $30.00 for his services as the clerk of the court from April 17,

                    services as sheriff of the county for one year, and the following allowances
                    were made for carrying the election returns to <placeName>

                    Hugh McGary was allowed $4.22 for standing guard two days and
                    furnishing provisions to John May, a prisoner. Aenas McCallister and James Marrs
                    were each allowed $22.00 and Bailey Anderson $18.00 for

                    road, originally called Anthony's mill, where the commissioners
                    appointed by the General Assembly of the state in 1818, were ordered to meet and
                    select a site for the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick county</region>

                    and Maxville road and Ninth street is the Yellowbanks, or Owensboro road. With
                    so many trails converging at this point it is easy to account for the
                    commissioners' location of Boonville.</p>

            <p>The survey of Darlington, the county seat, 1814 to 1818, mentions a road and
                    Higgins old line fence—I wonder just how old that line was. Thomas
                    Higgins was a lot owner in Darlington and was licensed to keep tavern; he was
                    appointed a justice of the peace, April 19, 1813, and was fined five dollars for
                    getting drunk while on the grand jury. Other property owners in Darlington were
                    John Sprinkle, William Beatty, Ratliff Boon—he got lot 42 for
                    forty-two dollars and paid it by clearing the timber off the public
                    square—James G. Jones, Solomon Rhoads, Jacob Sever, Jesse Gay, Hugh Mc-<placeName>

            <p>The only lot owners in Darlington who exercised their privilege of exchanging
                    their Darlington lots for lots in Boonville were Ratliff Boon, John Barker and
                    Pinkney Anderson. The others probably thought Boonville too far from

                    fifteen or twenty years and there must have been marriages of some kind, prior
                    to 1819. One day while hunting for some data I found in an old file case a bunch
                    of marriage bonds, one of which I copied. An applicant for marriage license had

            <p>I found marriage licenses endorsed by the magistrate with the words,
                    "Executed as commanded." In those days they did not waste any
                    paper; the certificates were torn off close to the writing, which was usually
                    closely written. Here in these old bursting file cases are contained records of

            <p>Inventories of old estates are interesting reading. What does the present
                    generation with all its sophistication know about flails, hackels, broad axes,
                    horn collars, linen wheels, spinning wheels, hooks, cranes, looms and other
                    things of domestic necessity in grandmother's day? The inventory of
                    Atha Meeks, the man who was killed by Chief Settedown, in the year 1811, lists
                    the personal property at $297.591/4 It was a big estate in those
                    days, and Atha Meeks was regarded as a man of wealth. A few of the items will
                    give an idea of what was required in a family of nine children: 1 bed and
                    furniture, $22.00; 1 bed and furniture, $9.50; 1 bed,
                    $6.00; 1 broad ax, $4.00; 5 narrow axes, $6.00;

                    wheel, $1.50; 1 loom and furniture, $8.00—that
                    must have been an extra fine loom, the usual appraisement for a loom was six
                    dollars—1 decanter, .371/2; 1 Pot and hooks, $1.50; 1

                    few of the articles appraised; much of the inventory was made up of hogs,
                    shoats, pigs, barrows, gilts, yearlings, cows and calves. Dishes, plates, cups,
                    knives and forks were appraised separately, not as now, "lumped

                    mills made of rocks or wood. Pounding out a grist of cornmeal was a slow and
                    laborious task of the pioneer, who veritably earned his bread by the sweat of
                    his brow in the process. The preemption of water power sites began with the

                    on Otter creek, in section 12-5-8; and Moses Matthews for a mill on the north
                    east 1/4 of section 1-7-8. Other mills, presumably horse power, were operated in
                    various parts of the county; Gentry's mill in the eastern part of the
                    Corydon road district was a voting precinct at an early period. The Little Joe

                                    miles, I have reached this little Town. My ride has been over
                                    the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                                    </placeName> road, which intersects this State. This road is cut
                                    through the marshy woods, nearly in a straight line, and 100
                                    feet wide. The land upon it is not improved. It is scarcely
                                    opened, even in a few places. Such a road is indeed tiresome.
                                    There is nothing upon it to interest you, and in many places,
                                    you can see before you 5 or 6 miles, untill the walls of trees
                                    on either side seem to close, and intercept your vision. Almost
                                    every cabin on this road is a house of <hi rend="i">"Privete intertanement"</hi> according to
                                    the spelling of this Country.</p>
                        <p>With the people of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, I am pleased. They are plain &amp; kind. <hi rend="i">"Mine Host,"</hi> is an old
                                    Virginian, and when he found out that I was a Virginian, he
                                    almost embraced me. A Virginian of the South or West, will greet
                                    with welcome, A Virginian, wherever he meets him. They seem to
                                    be proud of the name. The land here is rich, and level. The
                                    roads in wet weather, are nearly impassible. This is destined to
                                    be a rich State.</p>

                        <p>I have just spent a night with Mr. Rueben Thomas who emigrated
                                    from Rockbridge, Va., eight years since. He is well fixed for a
                                    new settler, in this Country. Everything about him has the
                                    appearance of comfort and neatness. His House is small and I
                                    slept soundly in the same room with his family—but
                                    his heart is large, and his welcome was full. He treated me with
                                    the utmost kindness and hospitality. The fine biscuit, hard
                                    yellow butter, and well-flavored coffee of Mrs. Thomas reminded
                                    me of Rockbridge. The plain and simple kindness of this western
                                    family, I shall not soon forget.</p>

                        <p>It is dull and raining. The Circuit Court is now in Session.
                                    These Hoosiers, do not mind the mud. They all wear heavy boots,
                                    coming up, over their pantaloons, in which they tramp about with
                                    impunity.</p>
                        <p rend="right">Oct. 25th.</p>
                        <p>I have just taken the deposition of Mr. Thomas, and now ready, to
                                    leave the land of Hoosiers. I will say, God Preserve me, from a
                                    Free Western State! The Hoosiers, so far as I have seen, are a
                                    rough but kind people.</p>
                        <p rend="right">MADISON, IN. Oct. 25th, 10 P.M.</p>
                        <p>I have just reached here again, after as miserable a ride, as I
                                    have ever had. I have rode 45 miles, since half after 11 today,
                                    over the same dull, interminable <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                                    </placeName> road, in a more dreary, muddy, and lonesome day,
                                    than that of my first ride upon it. No one can form any idea of
                                    the utter desolation of such a ride, untill he tries it. The
                                    road is hemmed in on both sides, by a dense wall of trees,
                                    towering up in the swamps and bogs, except in a few precious
                                    places, where rises a new log cabin, which is announced to you,
                                    some time before you see it, either by the Sign Post, of a
                                    tavern, or the barking of a dog.</p>
                        <p>At Napoleon, a little town on the way, I dined, or rather supped.
                                    I asked the landlady, a very neat looking Hoosier, whether or
                                    not she had any difficulty in getting servants.
                                    "Servants, Sir!" We have no servants. We call
                                    it, getting a girl—or getting help." These
                                    servant girls, are very proud and cannot brook the idea of being
                                    called servants. This Landlady told me that it was hard to keep
                                    them. They go away when they please, And never fail when they
                                    have earned money enough to buy a piece of finery, to go home to
                                    their friends, with the proceeds of their labour, upon their
                                    head and shoulders. They are on the constant lookout for
                                    husbands, and consequently do not engage to labour, for any one
                                    except by the week, or some other short period. Again I pray,
                                    may God protect me from these Free States!</p>
                        <p rend="right">Oct. 26th, 3 A.M.</p>
                        <p>I have just been wakened up, by the pounding and puffing of a
                                    Steamer, coming down the River. I hurried on my clothes, and
                                    shouldered my trunk, and went out with a candle, to make the
                                    signal, and hail the Boat. But the Boat had to land, for
                                    freight, and I got upon the Canton, <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-024-2-079"/> bound for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. The Tavern at which I stayed during the night, is
                                    called a Watch House. It is immediately on the bank of the
                                    River, and keeps, as I had been told, a look out for Boats for
                                    Passengers. I went to it at 11 last night, and asked the Bar
                                    Keeper, if he would keep a lookout— "O,
                                    No!" he said "I set up all last
                                    night." "Well, I asked, can I stay in the Bar
                                    Room by the Stove, untill a boat
                                    comes—"No." "Can you then
                                    give me a room? He told me he could. I then took lodging and
                                    watched out for myself. After I had gone up, I found I had left
                                    my umbrella, at the first tavern, at which I had stopped. I
                                    called down to the Bar Keeper, to know if he could send for it.
                                    He put his head out of the window, &amp; told me he could
                                    not. He in a moment popped his head out again, and "How
                                    much you give? I told him I would give a Bit. The Fellow went,
                                    but he brought the wrong umbrella, and in the morning, being in
                                    too great a hurry, to get it, I told the same fellow to get the
                                    Umbrella and keep it for his trouble. This was a Frenchman. This

                                    anticipated. The streets are
                                    broad—straight—and laid out
                                    regularly—but the buildings are not fine. The most of
                                    the buildings are small frame houses wh[ich] seem to have just
                                    been erected. The City seems to be growing rapidly. The State

                                    none of the family were at home. I strolled around the grove
                                    &amp; as the[y] drove back from Church—I walked

                                    where in the world I came from. I staid with him until after
                                    supper. About sundown he took me to the roof of the
                                    house—where I had the most magnificent view
                                    imaginable. The whole City lay spread out before us, whilst
                                    behind us the whole county was covered with
                                    crops—interspersed with groves of trees. The Noble
                                    Farm is a magnificent estate. It is a little over a mile from
                                    the State House—but the city has spread down along
                                    the Eastern line &amp; in a few years will surround it
                                    entirely. It consisted originally of 200 acres—just
                                    laid off on Davidson Street—35 feet front by 150 deep
                                    wh were selling readily at 250 &amp; 300 dollars. About 8
                                    o'clock I walked up to my Hotel—my uncle
                                    pointed out several buildings where the German Turners were
                                    celebrating the Sabbath Day in their usual manner. They seemed
                                    to be making political speeches.</p>
                        <p rend="right">Sept. 15th.</p>
                        <p>Went over in the morning to see the curiosities in the State
                                    House. The Trophies deposited in the Library Rooms by members of
                                    the Indiana Regiment were very interesting. I saw any quantity
                                    of old Mexican guns, swords, pistols, lances, &amp;c. There
                                    were a lot of breast and back plates, wh an ordinary man could
                                    not walk under. The Colours of the 2 &amp; 3d Regiments were
                                    literally torn into fragments—scarcely a shred of the
                                    silk remained untorn.</p>
                        <p>At 40 past 11 A.M. took the train for <placeName>

                                    </placeName> Depot exceeds anything I ever heard of. About 6 or
                                    7 long trains were just on the eve of leaving—whilst
                                    I suppose full 10,000 people were hurrying &amp; rushing
                                    about.</p>
                        <p>The <placeName>

                                    </placeName> Depots are not to be compared with it. We had a
                                    long train—just crammed with passengers. The
                                    appearance of the country for about 100 miles was not very
                                    striking—after leaving <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                                    </placeName> however, I never saw anything to surpass the beauty
                                    of the Country. The Prairies in several places spread out before
                                    us for miles—just as far as the eye c[oul]d reach in
                                    every direction. We passed immense fields of magnificent Corn
                                    reaching sometimes for miles. I am perfectly delighted with the
                                    Country between <placeName>

                        <p>We saw a mammoth pile of corn out in the open air just beside the
                                    road which I was told had been there, for nearly a year
                                    &amp; was still as sound as ever. The climate I infer from
                                    this, must be very dry. I was told that the farmers make a
                                    regular practice of leaving thheir corn out during the winter.</p>
                        <p>7 miles above <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                                    </placeName> we passed directly over the Tipacanoe battle
                                    ground. The scence of the battl is an elevated woody plain with
                                    a morass boardering it on the East &amp; a low bushy plain
                                    on the West. Harrison had his men on the high ground. The
                                    Indians crept through the morass slipped along the river bank
                                    and a portion of them took possession of the low grounds to the
                                    West. They then had Harrison between <pb n="136" id="VAA4025-024-2-081"/> two fires. The battle ground is a
                                    beautiful place still covered with trees of a primitive
                                    growth—all of which are more or less scared with
                                    bullet marks.</p>

                                    </placeName> a pretty Yankee girl took a portion of my seat. I
                                    struck up a chat with her—found her both intelligent
                                    &amp; agreeable. When she got off at Westville she invited
                                    me to call &amp; see her if I ever visited La porte,
                                    Indiana.</p>
                        <p>On the same train met several farmers from Louden who wer going

                                    It seems however to be nothing more than a sand bank. The
                                    country between M. City &amp; this place<hi rend="sup">2</hi> by moonlight seemed to be mostly hilly &amp;
                                    barren—very different from the rich level country we
                                    traveled over in the early part of the evening. About 9 the cool
                                    sharp wind proclaimed our proximity to the Lake. About half an
                                    hour afterwards the cars were running on the causeway which is
                                    built out in the Lake for some distance. We soon reached the
                                    Depot—the most magnificent &amp; imposing
                                    building of the kind I heave ever seen. It is constructed of
                                    splendidly dressed white stone—with the ceiling
                                    sloping somewhat in the curve of a semi Elipse.</p>
                        <p>Inside the building is splendidly finished off—having
                                    room for 7 different roads—each with a double track.</p>
                        <p>Beside there is a Baggage Depot—Telegraph Room
                                    &amp; Land Office in the building.</p>

                                    open corner lot—without enclosure of any
                                    kind—he pointed out a rude log cabin—wh
                                    seemed to have stood the blasts of many winters. The cabin stood
                                    in the centre of the lot—was constructed of unhewn
                                    logs dabbed with mud &amp; closely resembled the log cabins
                                    of the negroes in old Va.</p>
                        <p>My Uncle informed me that in that cabin was an old
                                    negro—now 108 years old who was a slave of his father
                                    in law &amp; is yet a slave—having refused to
                                    acknowledge his freedom. His name is Tom. To him &amp; his
                                    humble cabin the world is indebted for the name of that most

                                    Cabin. Henry Ward Beecher knew Uncle Tom when preeching in

            <p>For many years a member of the staff of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi>, Miss Nicholas brought to her task of writing the history
                    of Crown Hill Cemetery both literary experience and a wide knowledge of local
                    history. She has made a valuable addition to the records of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>' past. The detailed account of the history of the cemetery
                    itself is not without interest, but the short sketches of the distinguished men
                    buried in Crown Hill undoubtedly, for many persons, will be the most convenient
                    source of information, and the most valuable part of the book. Many would have
                    welcomed a map of Crown Hill indicating the burial places of those whose lives
                    are sketched in the text, so that they might be found easily by visitors. But
                    perhaps the historian should be satisfied with the 170 pages of biographies of
                    "The Distinguished Dead" and the additional biographical
                    material upon the "Corporators." He should also be reminded
                    that no biographical sketch is complete which does not include the location of
                    the grave of the subject. How much trouble would be saved for genealogists and
                    relatives if historical writers would always record this simple item and make
                    accessible what is often the most needed source of information, the tombstone.
                    Considering the great number of facts recorded, errors are not very numerous.

            <p>A detailed examination of the John Askin Papers would be out of place here. Their
                    value is self evident. John Askin visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> as early as 1762. In 1764 he took up his residence in Mackinac, and
                    in 1780 he moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he lived till 1802. He then moved south across the river
                    (which here runs east) into <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, but he continued many <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> connections until his death in 1815. He engaged extensively in the
                    fur trade, in supplying government posts, at one time controlled several sailing
                    vessels, and throughout his career had extensive correspondence with a wide
                    spread group of friends. Even these few facts show the many phases of early
                    western history which the Askin papers will illumine.</p>
            <p>The format adopted by the <hi rend="i">Burton Historical Records</hi> deserves
                    the highest commendation. This volume is a handsome, durable book, with no
                    attempt at fancy display, but with the best of material and craftsmanship.</p>

            <p>John W. Cravens, secretary of Indiana University, has recently published an
                    article on "The Trustees of Indiana University." He succeeded
                    in getting the desired data concerning all the trustees except <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Sawyer who was a member of the board in 1840. The old records do
                    not even give the county from which Mr. Sawyer came. Can any readers furnish Mr.
                    Cravens the desired information?</p>
