                PREFACE.
                MANY young people, and especially widows and single ladies, when they
                    first possess money of their own, are in want of advice when they have
                    commonplace business matters to transact. It is not always easy for them to find
                    a friend who will listen patiently to their difficulties, and express no
                    surprise at their ignorance, which has made me see how much a little Manual of
                    this kind has been wanted. Numerous excellent works are published (see p. 121
                    for a list of them), but the mistake their Authors generally make is in
                    supposing the Reader to know something of business. I write for those who know
                        nothing. My aim throughout is to avoid all technicalities; to
                    give plain and practical direc? tions, not
                    only as to what ought to be done, but how to do it.
                Ladies rarely have any business to attend to before they attain the age of
                    twenty?one. They are usually older when, through their father’s or their
                    husband’s death, they find themselves possessed of money of their own, and are
                    then first called upon to act. They naturally feel shy and awkward, at that time
                    of life, in asking such a simple question as, How am I to draw a Cheque? How
                    should I write to my Banker to send me some money? I want to sell out of the
                    Stocks, what must I do? How am I to get a Power of Attorney? When once known, a
                    person soon finds that all these things are very simple, and as soon forgets how
                    difficult and strange they once appeared to her. I trust this little book will
                    prove useful to many of those who have yet to learn.

            GUIDE TO THE UNPROTECTED.
            
                CHAPTER I.
                INTRODUCTORY.
                
                    INVESTMENTS.
                    WHEN an inexperienced person comes into possession of her fortune,
                        and especially if it be a small one, her first inquiry is, “How can I invest
                        my money so as to get the highest possible interest?” Let her rather seek to
                        place it where her Capital will be safest. (By
                        Capital and Principal is meant her fortune, or the whole sum she possesses.)
                        The Duke of Wellington used to say “High interest is another name for bad security.” In this country 4½ per cent. is
                        generally the highest safe Interest you can receive: 4 per
                        cent. more usually so. When 6, 7, 8, or more per cent. is offered by Banks,
                        Mortgages, Loans, or Mines, beware of accepting it, as the probability is
                        that you will lose both your Principal and Interest, as so many have done.
                        Such an Interest cannot be given consistently with the safety of the
                        concern.
                    Good Mortgages, and the Debenture Bonds of the leading Railway and Canal
                        Companies, are very convenient investments for persons of small
                        means, because the investors will at the end receive back the
                            same sum they originally put in, and in the meantime
                        receive an unvarying amount of Interest paid
                            regularly; also, in the case of a Railway or other Company
                        not being wholly successful, the Interest of its Bonds, &c. is paid
                            before the Dividends of the Shareholders.
                    Joint?Stock Banks.—A lady should not on any account
                        take any Shares whatever in a Joint? Stock
                        Bank, Mine, Partnership, or any other joint trading concern, unless it be
                        established under the new “Limited Liability” Act, as otherwise she is
                        liable to lose her last penny if the Bank or speculation should fail. Even
                        if “limited,” they should not be invested in without the greatest possible
                        caution, nor until after very careful inquiries have been satisfactorily
                        answered.
                    Shares in Railways, Canals, Gas and Water Works, may often prove
                        good investments, but some risk necessarily attends them, as may be seen by
                        the value of the Shares constantly rising and falling. The Interest or
                        Dividend they pay is constantly changing, according to the state of trade,
                        demand, &c.
                    These sorts of investments pay from 3 to 9 per cent.—sometimes even more, and
                        sometimes much less—to original Shareholders (that is, to those who took
                        Shares at the beginning of the concern), and from 3 to 5 per cent. to those
                        who purchase Shares. Where the Company is equally success? ful year after year, their Interest is steady and
                        safe, as it arises from the regular and large demand for gas and water, or
                        the traffic on the railway or canal.
                    Guaranteed and Preference Shares are far safer investments than
                        ordinary Shares. By the former are meant Shares which, if a certain fixed
                        Dividend cannot be paid by the Company which guarantees them. They therefore
                        cannot be paid less, but if the property be thriving they participate in the
                        surplus. For Preference Shares, see Chap. IV.
                    Do not put all your money into one concern. Put it into several.
                        Then if one fails in value another probably rises, and so your income will
                        keep more equal: if one of your investments unfortunately turns out a
                        failure, you lose only a part and not the whole of your fortune. When you
                        think you have placed your money in the
                        safest way you can, do not alter its investment without some good reason.
                        Every change costs money, and is attended with trouble and anxiety.
                    In investing Capital, attend to the following suggestions:—
                    1st. Bank.—Select a safe and respectable Bank for the deposit of
                        your money.
                    2dly. Asking advice.—Seek a sensible and upright Friend, who is
                        a good man of business, to consult as to what concerns are safe or unsafe
                        for investments. Many worthy men are bad men of business, and recommend
                        investments because they think or hear they are good, without knowing
                        anything of the matter: and for that reason seldom consult ladies, as
                        usually they know little or nothing of business, and when that is the case
                        it is much like the blind leading the blind. Men who are in business are in
                        the habit of looking out for investments for their own money, and of hearing
                        competent opinions upon them; and if they
                        are upright in their dealings and are doing well in the world, it is fair to
                        presume that their judgment is good. Having found one, be guided by him, and
                        do not ask everybody’s opinion, which only unsettles you.
                    Imposition.—To show how easily an inexperienced man may be
                        imposed upon, I may mention an anecdote I heard from a person who had been
                        almost persuaded by a friend, who knew nothing of business, to take some
                        Shares in a Company which promised extremely good interest. He went to the
                        office, which was in the City, to make inquiries. The Manager tried much to
                        persuade him to invest, assuring him of the safety of the concern. While C—
                        was hesitating, a man rushed in, and said in an eager tone, “Pray, Sir, have
                        you any more Shares on sale? I have an order for fifty more, they are in
                        such great request that I am afraid of their being all sold before I can get
                        enough.” His manner and words opened C—’s eyes, who suspected that this was a plan to entrap him to invest, and in
                        quietly walked off. The Company failed in a very short time afterwards.

                        business. Keep this locked up in a safe place, or it may be deposited with
                        your Bankers for safe custody during absences from home, or for longer
                        periods if necessary. Keep all papers, letters, &c.
                        relating to money and business transactions. Never burn any letter or paper
                        on business; much trouble and loss is often occasioned by inexperienced
                        persons doing this. In the course of three or four years, and not till then,
                        you will learn what is necessary to keep and what is not.
                    
                    Arrange your Papers under a few heads. Fold them up neatly of a
                        size, and “docket” them; that is, write outside what they are, and the date
                        of receiving them, thus—
                    
                        1st March, 1863.
                        Midland Railway Coy.
                        Notice of Call, payable on 1st July, 1863.
                    
                    
                    Keep copies of all letters you write on business matters: it is
                        often necessary to refer to them.
                    In writing letters of business, they should be short, clear, and to the
                        point. No superfluous words—no repetition. Each subject should be in a
                        separate paragraph, and written on the full size sheet of note?paper. It is
                        a great mistake to suppose that a long letter gets more attention; it is
                        quite the contrary.
                    Keep all receipted Bills six years, and then you may destroy
                        them, because an unclaimed debt of more than six years’ standing is not
                        recoverable at law. Fold them up lengthways, and “docket” them as I have
                        just described. Suppose you make a purchase of furniture from Mr. Richard
                        Jones for £1 2
                            s.

                            pence
                         on Jan. 5th 1863; then his Bill will be folded lengthways and
                        docketed as follows:—
                    
                    
                        Jan. 1863.
                        Jones, Richard, London. £1 : 2 : 6
                        (Furniture.)
                    
                    At the end of the year, the Bills that have accumulated are quickly arranged
                        alphabetically and tied up. There is thenceforward no trouble in referring
                        to a Bill. All this seems irksome at first, but it is wonderful how natural
                        it becomes to fold them of one size and
                        docket them before putting them away in your drawer. When unscrupulous
                        tradespeople are aware you are methodical they seldom send in a Bill
                        twice.
                    Pay your debts regularly, though they be ever so ever so small.
                        How many tradespeople are ruined by the thoughtlessness of their employers,
                        and have to borrow money at a very high rate of interest, till it suits the
                        convenience of their customers to pay their Christmas or Midsummer Bills! A
                        poor person is not allowed by his creditors to run up a Bill.
                    Time is money to the poor.
                    The difference of being rich or poor.—A man is rich who lives
                        upon what he has. A man is poor who lives upon what is
                            coming. A prudent man lives within his income, and saves
                        against “a rainy day.”
                
                
                
                    KEEPING ACCOUNTS.
                    No one should be satisfied without keeping regular accounts of what she
                        receives and what she spends. She then knows what she has, and how it is
                        spent; and if at the end of the year her expenditure has exceeded her
                        income, she can refer to her books and see where to retrench. A person who
                        keeps no accounts may be compared to a ship without a chart. She goes on
                        without knowing where she is. There are many ways of keeping accounts which
                        it would be beyond the limits of this book to go into, but the way you can
                        easiest understand is the best to adopt. Once a month, transfer from your
                        daily Account?book to another Book, called a Ledger, what you have spent
                        during that month, and place the items under different heads. For instance,
                        under the head “Dress” put all you have spent in dress; under “Amusements,”
                        all that you have spent in that way. Every
                        year add these up, and then you will see at a glance how your income has
                        gone, where you have exceeded and where you have saved. Have no Christmas
                        Bills; pay all creditors once a week, and your servants once a month or
                        quarter. You then know how you stand; you feel out of debt with everybody;
                        you cannot easily be imposed upon, because you can readily look back a week
                        to see that your Bills are correct, though you are perplexed in looking back
                        for a year.
                    Periodical Receipts and Payments.—It is a great convenience to
                        rule two pages at the end of your Account?book into twelve columns for the
                        twelve months: one to remind you when your Dividends become due; the other
                        when Payments should be made. Some people have a page for a “Statement of
                        Property and Incomings,” and one for yearly expenses. I insert a few
                        specimens which may be useful to some of my readers.

                    Sharing Expenses.—In travelling with a friend on the Continent,
                        it is sometimes difficult to divide the expenses correctly. I therefore
                        insert an example. When the expenses of two or more persons are included in
                        one account, their respective shares will be most readily separated by
                        adopting the following form. We will suppose A. and B. to be at an hotel in
                        France, and their landlord to have entered everything they have ordered,
                        whether jointly or separately, into a single Bill. The Bill occupies the
                        right?hand compartment of the table; in the left?hand compartment are the
                        calculations of A. and B., which would probably be made on a separate bit of
                        paper. The principle is to have three columns; one for A.’s peculiar
                        expenses, one for B.’s, and one for common expenses. The sum of the common
                        expenses is halved, and one of the halves is added to A.’s column and the
                        other half to B.’s. Finally, A. and B.’s shares are added together to see
                        that their sum tallies with the amount of the Bill.

                    When the common expenses form the bulk of the Bill, it is hardly worth while
                        to copy them out. In that case, subtract the sum of A. and B.’s private
                        expenses from the total of the Bill; the
                        remainder will of course be the sum of the common expenses; halve this, and
                        proceed as before.
                    Taking Stock.—Once a year some people “take Stock;” that is,
                        calculate the value of all their Stock or Share property, by the help of a
                        Share?list of that date, such as is published in every day’s
                                Times, or in a more complete form as a
                        separate daily publication.

                    Bank Notes.—When you receive Bank notes, either those of the
                        Bank of England or of Country Bankers, write your initials on the back of each note, and insert a memorandum in
                        your Pocket?book, or some other book, of the amount, number, place of issue,
                        and date of each note. Should all or any of these notes be stolen, lost, or
                        mislaid, immediately write to or call upon your Banker, supplying the above
                        information, and measures will at once be taken to “stop” or
                        refuse payment of them; and for another reason it is an excellent plan to
                        write your name or your initials, with the date of receiving it, at the back
                        of each note, in order to identify among others, in case of any
                        misunderstanding after it has been received or paid away; thus—

                    SIGNING DOCUMENTS.
                    Inexperienced persons should pause before they consent to sign their name to
                        any Document, and particularly before signing and putting their finger on the seal and saying the cabalistic
                        words, “I deliver this as my Act and Deed.” Let them understand
                            well what it is they are undertaking the responsibility of,
                        and that by signing they may imperil their last shilling. But none need feel
                        anxiety in witnessing a person’s signature to a Deed. The act
                        is one that cannot compromise him, and it is a social duty to perform, for
                        he is sure at some time to have need of the same assistance in his own
                        behalf. Considerable inconvenience is sometimes caused in country places by
                        a friend declining to do this simple act of kindness.
                    Signature.—Sign your name always in the same way in Cheques and
                        business papers, that it may be recognised, and make it
                            distinct as possible. Many whose writing is in other
                        respects clear and legible, sign their names in such a manner that it is
                        almost impossible to recognise them.
                
                
                
                    RESIDENCE AND ADDRESS.
                    When you place any money in an investment be particular to send your full
                        address, legibly written, to the Secretary of the Company, and
                        inform him to what Banker he is to pay your Dividends. If you change your
                        residence, immediately write to inform him of the fact. It is best to do
                        this a little time before the money is due. Some people make their address
                        still clearer by putting a line round it, thus—

                        Railway Shares, and especially Land, or in any money affairs, even with the
                        nearest relation, make it a rule that everything be transacted in the same
                        formal business?like manner that would be adopted if he were a stranger.
                        Were this rule attended to, frequent annoyances, much expense, and many
                        family quarrels would be avoided. In disputed cases, resulting from the
                        absence of a business?like understanding, friends and relations
                            may become satisfied by mutual concessions and confidence
                        in one another’s integrity; but when they die, their Executors are bound to
                        act by the hard judgment of the law.
                    Saleable Title.—When Shares or Land are given or sold to you by
                        a relation or others, ask your legal adviser to see that all necessary steps
                        are taken for making your Title a saleable one, so that you can sell the property whenever you may
                        desire to do so, without trouble or extra expense.
                    Security.—If you lend money as an investment, always take every
                        precaution to obtain a safe security for it from the Borrower—viz. a
                        Mortgage of Land or other Property, worth at least, in the case of Land,
                        one?third more, and in the other case, half as much again as the sum you
                        lend.
                    Receipts from Friends.—Always take a Receipt or
                            Acknowledgment from a relation, as from a stranger, for borrowed
                        money. Should your relation die, his Executors could not pay you unless you
                        had a Receipt or some other proof of debt to show, or he had named it in his
                        Will. Executors must act only on legal evidence or pursuant to (
                            i.e.
                            id est
                         in accordance with) the directions of the Will: they cannot use
                        their own discretion.
                    If you have lent a person money, when he pays it back, you will have to
                        return the Receipt he gave you. If this is
                        done through the Post, or through another person, take the precaution of
                        tearing or defacing the receipt before sending it.
                    Do not lend a Deed or Map of your property to any person without the advice
                        of your Attorney, and in any event desire the person who borrows it to give
                        you a Receipt for it. An old Map of Land is often a most important document
                        to determine boundaries.
                
                
                    BROKERS AND BANKERS.
                    When you want to buy or sell Government Stocks, Exchequer Bills,
                        &c. or Shares in any Railway, Canal, Gas, Water Works, or any other
                        Company, it is necessary to employ a Broker, who charges a per?centage, or
                        in other words, a Brokerage or Commission, upon the amount of Sale or
                        Purchase. It is of course important that the Broker so employed, should be
                        of high standing and respectability. Bankers also undertake to
                        transact all business of this description,
                        and they hold themselves responsible for the proper completion of the Sale
                        or Purchase, and generally speaking, no extra expense is incurred by the
                        buyer or seller; an understanding or arrangement subsisting between the
                        Banker and Broker as to Commission.
                    The Broker’s charge rarely, if ever, exceeds ? per cent. or 2
                            s.

                            pence
                         for every £100 of Government Stocks. It varies considerably in
                        Railway and other Shares, but is always in accordance with the regulations
                        of the Stock Exchange.
                    Always give your instructions in writing, it prevents many
                        opportunities of mistake.
                    Money on Deposit.—When you sell any Shares, &c., place the
                        money in a Bank till you have found a new investment. If it is to lie in the
                        Bank for any length of time (two or three months, or longer) it is better to
                        deposit it in the Bank at interest, for which the Bank will pay small
                        Interest. If it is a very large amount you can put it into the Funds or buy
                        Exchequer Bills.
                
                
                
                    DIRECTORSHIPS.
                    Never allow your name to be put down as a Director of a concern unless you
                        attend personally to it, or you may be liable, by the acts of others, to
                        lose the whole of your property. You also mislead, by making the public
                        fancy you attend to the concern.
                
            
            
            
                CHAPTER II.
                MONEY TRANSACTIONS WITH BANKERS, CHEQUES, AND BILLS.
                
                    WHEN you have fixed upon a Banker, and placed some money in his
                        hands, he will give you a book, called a Pass?book, or Bank?book.
                
                
                    BANK OR PASS?BOOK.
                    The Banker will enter on one side of this book all the money that is paid
                        into the Bank by yourself or by others for you. These sums are called
                        Credits, and that side of the book is called Cr., short for Creditor. On the other side he will put down from
                        time to time the money you have drawn out of the Bank, by Cheques, or
                            Orders. These sums drawn out are called
                        Debits, and that side of the book Dr., or
                        Debtor.
                    Never write anything yourself in your Pass?book, for it should
                        be entirely written up by the Banker from time to time from his Ledger, of
                        which it considered to be a copy, and it is then legal evidence, as against
                        him, of the state of your account. Every six months, or better still, once a
                        month, your Pass?book should be sent to the Bank to be “made
                        up,” that is, to have all money paid into the Bank, and all money
                        drawn out of the Bank, entered into it. The sums of the entries on each page
                        are carried forward to the next corresponding page, until the time arrives
                        for balancing the book, which is generally done at Midsummer and Christmas.
                        This will show that all is entered properly, it enables you to know at a
                        glance what money you have in the Bank, and prevents your “overdrawing
                            your account” (this means, drawing a Cheque to a greater amount
                        than you have money in the Bank). An account should never be overdrawn,
                        unless there has been a previous
                        arrangement with the Banker to that effect.
                    When you want your Bank?book “making up,” write to your Banker,
                        enclosing it, or take it yourself, and ask him “to make it up.” Bankers
                        will, if desired, send a statement of your account on thin paper, which is
                        especially convenient to persons travelling abroad. A Pass?book may now be
                        sent by Book Post for one penny, if its weight is under four ounces.
                    Sums of Money in a Banker’s hands.—As a general rule, it is
                        considered unhandsome to have less money in a Bank than a hundred pounds.
                        The Bankers gain nothing for the trouble they take in receiving your money
                        and paying your Cheques, and running the risk of fraud, except by the
                        interest they obtain upon the sum you have placed in their hands.
                
                
                
                    CHEQUES.
                    Formerly it was not legal to draw a Cheque for a sum under One Pound, but
                        there is now no restriction in this respect. It is better however not to be
                        in the habit of drawing Cheques for very small amounts, say
                        under £5. You can easily pay small sums yourself either in Cash or by Post
                        Office Order; but when necessary, Bankers will not generally object to
                        them.
                    A halfpenny is never mentioned in a Cheque; no sum less than a penny.
                    A Cheque on a Banker is merely an order on the Banker to pay money to
                            A.B. or Bearer, or to A.B. or Order. It is
                        usually written lengthways on a half sheet of note?paper, when a printed
                        form is not used. Suppose your name is Catherine Neville, that you bank with
                        Messrs. Coutts, and with to pay Mr. — £15 2

                                    London, Jan. 2, 1863.
                                    Messrs. Coutts & Co.
                                
                                Please pay Mr. —, or Bearer, Fifteen Pounds Two Shillings and
                                    Sixpence.
                                
                                    £15:2:6
                                    Catherine Neville.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    The signature or initials “Catherine Neville” is written across a penny
                            receipt or draft stamp, not a penny
                        postage?stamp. In some cases it is absolutely necessary to add the sum and
                        date, 
                            i.e.
                            id est
                         on stamps required to be affixed to Foreign Bills of Exchange. I
                        have inserted specimens of each kind in this book.
                    Any person who may get possession of the Cheque in this form can procure its
                        payment at Messrs. Coutts’ Bank without question. This freedom is convenient
                        to small tradesmen, who are unknown to Bankers.
                    
                    Orders.—Suppose, however, you write— 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        London, Jan 2, 1863.
                                        Messrs. Coutts & Co.
                                    
                                    On demand please pay Mr. —, or Order, Fifteen Pounds Two
                                        Shillings and Sixpence.
                                    
                                        £15:2:6
                                        Catharine Neville.
                                        
                                            
                                                C.N.
                                            
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                         Then the Cheque cannot be paid until Mr. — has written his name on the
                        back of it. Therefore, whenever you send a Cheque by Post, or Messenger,
                        write it “or Order,” and not “or Bearer;” this shields you from any fraud
                        except direct forgery. Indeed, you will find it a safe precaution to make
                        all your Cheques payable “to Order,” as you will hereby retain evidence of
                        the payment having been made, even if you lose your receipt.
                    Crossed Cheques or Orders.—But there is yet a further
                        precaution, if you write—
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        London, Jan 2, 1863.
                                        Messrs. Coutts & Co.
                                    
                                    Please pay Mr. —& Co., or Order, Fifteen
                                        Pounds Two Shillings and Sixpence.
                                    
                                        £15:2:6
                                        Catharine Neville.
                                        
                                            2/1/63
                                            C.N.
                                            £15:2:6
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                    Then, not only must Mr. — first “endorse it” by signing his name on the back,
                        if it be an Order, but it will not then be paid by your Banker, unless it is
                        presented for payment by some other Banker, or to a known customer; and for
                        this reason, never cross a Cheque intended to be presented for payment at
                        your own Bank, by the person in whose favour it is drawn. If a dishonest
                        person stole the letter, and forged Mr. —’s name, he could not get the
                        Cheque cashed, unless he happened to be in such good circumstances as to
                        have an account of his own with a Banker. This reduces the risk of fraud
                        very considerably. If instead of writing “and Company” or only
                            “& Co.” you write the name of Mr. —’s banker, the
                            chance of fraud is still further
                        reduced. Always adopt this or the last preceding form when you cannot obtain
                        a receipt at the moment of writing the Cheque.
                    Dating Cheques in advance of the day.—Never let a Cheque bear
                        the date of a day after that on which you issue it. The penalty is £100 to
                        the “Drawer” of the Cheque, as well as to the Banker who pays
                        it knowingly. Any person taking it (knowingly) is liable to a penalty of
                        £20.
                    The “Drawer” is the person who signs the Cheque.
                    Cheque, after a person’s death.—A Banker must not pay a Cheque
                        if he is aware the Drawer is dead. He is quite justified in paying the
                        Cheque if he is ignorant of the fact. Also, a Cheque is invalid after the
                        Drawer is a Bankrupt.
                    Cheque, when presented for payment.—A Cheque should be presented for payment as soon as
                        possible after it has been received, as in the event of any undue delay and
                        failure of the Bank, the holder will have no claim on the drawer.
                    Cheque, if dishonoured.—The Banker writes on it “No effects,” or
                        “Refer to Drawer,” or he gives some other reason for not paying it.
                    Writing distinctly.—Be careful in drawing a Cheque for eight
                        pounds that the “t” at the end of the word “Eight”
                        should join on the “P” of the word “Pounds.” I
                        believe no sum is so easily altered in a Cheque, if it should fall into the
                        hands of a dishonest person. By simply adding a “y” it makes
                            “Eight” “Eighty.” The dots should be put very
                        close to the figure 8 to prevent an 0 being added there. Also, it is
                        advisable not to allow room for a dishonest person to add anything
                            before the sum written down. Thus, if your Cheque is for
                        £60, you must not leave space enough to add “Two Hundred”
                        before the “Sixty.” Another
                        safeguard is as follows:—suppose your Cheque is for £82 15
                            s.
                            shilling
                         6
                            d.
                            pence
                        , write across it in bold letters the words, “Under ninety
                            pounds.”
                    Stamp.—All Cheques must have a Draft or Receipt (not a Postage
                        Stamp) adhesive or impressed; also all Drafts or Orders for payment of money
                        to Bearer on demand. When you write a Cheque on a piece of note?paper you
                        must affix a Stamp, and cancel it by writing on it your name or initials.
                        Each penny Stamp affixed to Cheques or Orders must be cancelled by writing
                        your name across it, or your initials upon it. There are also Stamps which
                        are required by law to be affixed to Foreign Bills of Exchange, when
                        negotiated in England, and when these Stamps are used, they must be
                        cancelled by writing your name across, adding also the date.
                    Printed Cheque?book.—Ask your Banker for a Cheque?book ready
                        stamped; it saves trouble. You will have to
                        pay a penny for each Stamp: the most usual number is three dozen, which will
                        therefore cost 3
                            s.
                            shilling
                         Your Cheque?book should be looked up, never left
                        about. Before using any Cheque, see that the whole of the Cheques are
                        numbered in a regular series. The same number should be printed or written
                        on the Cheque, 
                            and
                            and and
                         in the margin or counterfoil, on the left?hand side of the
                        Cheque?book.
                    In the next page is a specimen of the Cheque?books ordinarily given.
                    The margin on the left?hand side is for setting down the particulars of the
                        Cheques that have been drawn and torn off.
                    If the Cheque?book is made out “or order,” the words “on
                            demand” must accompany the word “pay,” as required
                        by the Act of Parliament permitting Cheques to be drawn to
                            “Order,” instead of only to “Bearer,” as
                        formerly.
                    If your printed Cheque is to “Bearer,” and you wish to make a Cheque to
                        “Order,” put your pen across “Bearer” and write “Order,” as thus, Bearer.Order.
                    
                     
                    
                    We will suppose Mrs. A. Bushe wishes to pay Mrs. Mary Collins, on May 4th,
                        1862, the sum of £27 6
                            s.
                            shilling

                         for Furniture, and that she banks with Messrs. Edwards in
                        Newcastle:—
                     
                    
                    If your printed Cheque has no Stamp, you must procure and put on an adhesive
                        one. The margin, or “counterfoil,” of your Cheques is a useful reference, to
                        know when, and to whom, they were severally paid.
                    To procure money from your Banker for yourself.—Write a Cheque
                        “to Self or Bearer;” cross it with the name of your Banker, and send it by
                        post to him with the accompanying letter. Suppose your Banker is Messrs.
                        Coutts—

                                    Messrs. Coutts & Co.
                                
                                Please pay to self, or bearer, Twenty Pounds. £20:0:0
                                        Messrs. Coutts, London.
                                
                                    Ellen Strange.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    Or it is sufficient to write a letter, without sending a Cheque, but a Stamp
                        must be affixed to the letter and properly cancelled, as on a Cheque,
                        thus:—

                                    To Messrs. Coutts,
                                
                                Please to send Twenty Pounds (£20:0:0) in five?pound notes, in a
                                    registered letter to my address as below, viz.
                                (State address.)

                    N.B.—Remember there must always be a Stamp to every Cheque, whether written
                        on a sheet of paper or on a printed Form. Take Stamps with you when you go
                        abroad. Always use the printed Form in preference to a written one.
                    Transferring Money.—It is often convenient to write a note to
                        your Banker, to transfer money you owe to another, who banks at
                        the same Bank as yourself. In this case there is no possibility of fraud or loss from the miscarriage of your
                        letter. You may write thus:—
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    London, March 4th, 1863.
                                    Messrs. Barclay & Co.
                                
                                Please transfer Six Pounds Five Shillings (£6:5:0) to Mr. Francis
                                    Mark’s account with you, and charge it to my account.
                                
                                    Emily Wilson.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    It is better to send the letter as above, than to enclose a Cheque to your
                        Bankers, requesting the amount mentioned to be placed to Mr. Mark’s
                        account.
                    If the person in question does not bank at the same Bank as yourself, this is
                        the form:—

                                    To Mr. Henry Somerset, Manager of the Norwich
                                        Bank.
                                
                                Please to order the payment of Twenty Pounds (£20:0:0) to the
                                    account of Mr. Eli Smythe, with Messrs. Taylors and Lloyds,
                                    Bankers in Birmingham, charging it to my account.
                                
                                    Jane Gubbons.

                    To open an Account with a Banker.—It is often convenient to have
                        a Banker in London as well as one in the country. If you wish “to open an
                        account,” that is, to begin banking with one, obtain an introduction, and
                        write thus to the new Banker—say Messrs. Coutts:—
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    (Put date and full address.)
                                    To Messrs. Coutts.
                                
                                Gentlemen,—Please to put the enclosed Cheque to the credit of an
                                    account, which I will, with your permission, now open with
                                    you.
                                
                                    Yours,
                                    Caroline Smith.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    Or— 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        (Put date and full address)
                                        Messrs. Coutts.
                                    
                                    Gentlemen,—I have this day desired the Bath Bank, Messrs.
                                        James, to transfer Four Hundred Pounds to my credit with
                                        yourselves (£400), as I am desirous of opening an account
                                        with your House.
                                    
                                        Yours obediently,
                                        Caroline Smith.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                    Then you must write to your Old Banker, Messrs. James—
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    (Put date and place.)
                                    To Messrs. James, Bath Bank.
                                
                                Please pay Four Hundred Pounds to my account with Messrs. Coutts
                                    in London.
                                
                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                    £400:0:0
                                    Caroline Smith.
                                    C.S.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    Money at Interest.—Many Bankers allow Interest on Deposit, and
                        some also allow Interest on a large current
                        account. If you have a large sum in your Bankers’ hands, and wish some of it
                        to be placed at Interest, write—
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    (Date and place.)
                                
                                Gentlemen,—I shall be obliged by your informing me whether you
                                    allow Interest for money left on Deposit. What is your present
                                    rate, and what notice do you require for the withdrawal of the
                                    same?
                                
                                    Yours obediently,
                                    Caroline Smith.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    A Deposit Account means an Account kept by your Bankers of money
                        left in his hands, on the understanding that he is to pay you a certain rate
                        of Interest agreed upon, and requires you to give him a specified notice
                        before the money is withdrawn.
                    Address in Letters of Business.—It is always usual to write at
                        the bottom or top of the letter the name of the person to whom it is
                            addressed, as since envelopes have been
                        used, it is seldom mentioned otherwise in the letter.
                    Receiving Cheques.—When a Cheque is sent you, cross it with the
                        name of your Banker—say Coutts—if it be not already crossed,
                        and send it in a letter to them, which you should register if the Cheque be
                        of much value, and write—
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    April 6th, 1863. (Address.)
                                    Messrs. Coutts & Co.
                                
                                Please put the enclosed Cheque for £15:12:6 to the credit of my
                                    account.
                                
                                    Emma Gregson.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    N.B.—On receiving a Cheque, acknowledge its receipt by return of
                        Post, specifying in your letter the amount. If your Banker lives near to
                        you, and you intend paying the Cheque to him yourself, the crossing need not
                        be made.
                    
                    Cheques for Money lent.—If a friend borrows money from you, and
                        afterwards repays you with a Cheque, you will naturally send it to your
                        Banker to be cashed; but unless you give special instructions to the
                        contrary, he will enter it on the Credit side of your
                        Pass?book, where its appearance will swell the amount of your receipts, may
                        embarrass your accounts, and make your income appear larger than it really
                        is. To avoid this, tell your Banker “not to pass it through your
                            account,” but simply “to get it cashed for you,” or,
                        in other words, “To give cash for it, instead of placing it to your
                            credit.”
                    Never destroy a Cheque.—If a Cheque is given you, and you do not
                        wish to use it, tear off and destroy the signature, then
                        enclose the Cheque (which, having no signature, is useless) to the person
                        who drew it.
                
                
                
                    LETTERS OF CREDIT AND CIRCULAR NOTES.
                    When a person is going to travel on the Continent he usually
                        takes with him a Letter of Credit, or Circular Letters, generally both. In
                        order to obtain the former, he deposits with his Banker the sum he wishes to
                        have entered in his Letter of Credit, and names the towns where he may
                        probably wish to draw money.
                    Suppose Mr. A— is going to Rome, and thinks he may possibly want £500, and
                        may wish to draw money in Paris, Basle, Florence, Rome, and Frankfort. He
                        writes to his London Banker (or else asks his Country Banker to write to
                        their London Banker) to send him a Letter of Credit for £500 upon those
                        places. Should he mention to him five towns, he must sign his name on five
                        different slips of foreign or thin paper, and enclose them at the same time.
                        If he mentions eight towns, then eight slips of paper must be sent, one for
                        each place mentioned.
                    
                    The London Banker writes to each of the towns specified, and encloses Mr.
                        A—’s signature. Mr. A— will see that those particular towns are mentioned in
                        his Letter of Credit, and what Bankers he can go to; also the full sum he
                        may draw for. If Mr. A— finds he wants £50 in Paris, he refers to his Letter
                        of Credit and takes it to the Banker mentioned, and asks for that sum in the
                        coin of the country. He is requested to sign his name, and if the signature
                        is like that on the slip of paper sent from Mr. A—’s London Banker, the
                        money is immediately paid to him, and the Banker inserts in the Letter of
                        Credit how much Mr. A— has received from him, which enables other Bankers to
                        see how much remains of the £500 when he asks for more money.
                    On Mr. A—’s return to England, he send the Letter of Credit to his Banker,
                        that he may know how much has been drawn.
                    A Letter of Credit is worded much in this way:—
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    Messrs. L—, Geneva.
                                    Messrs. F—, Turin.
                                    Messrs. M—, Vienna.
                                    London, 9th July, 1862.
                                    Gentlemen,
                                
                                We have the pleasure to establish a credit in favour of X.Y. Esq.
                                    who will present to you this letter, and we will thank you to
                                    supply him with Cash to the extent of One Hundred Pounds (£100
                                    sterling), or such part thereof as may not have been previously
                                    paid upon this credit, writing off on the back of this letter
                                    the sum advanced, and taking his drafts on us in your favour for
                                    your reimbursement, which we engage duly to honour.
                                
                                    This credit is to be in force for twelve months only from
                                        its date.
                                
                                
                                    We are, Gentlemen,
                                     Your very obedient Servants,
                                    A.B. & Co.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    Circular Notes, for persons going to the Continent, from ten
                        pounds and upwards, can be obtained from many London Bankers, and the
                        intending traveller’s own Banker will them for him. They have this advantage over a Letter of Credit;
                        the traveller can receive his money at many different places, instead of one
                        or two fixed towns, and even innkeepers will frequently cash them.
                    “The traveller, having determined how much money he will require for his
                        journey, pays in that sum to the Banker, and receives in exchange, without
                        any charge except the Stamp duty, notes to the same amount, each of the
                        value of £10 or upwards, together with a general letter or
                            order, addressed by the House to its foreign agents, which
                        serves to identify the bearer. The letter is addressed to nearly two hundred
                        agents and correspondents in different parts of Europe, so that whatever the
                        traveller may be, he cannot be very far removed from his supplies.
                    “The value of the Notes is reduced into Foreign money, at the current usance
                        of exchange on London, at the time and place of payment, subject to no
                        deduction for Commission, or to any other charge whatever,
                        unless the payment be required in some particular coin which bears a premium. They are drawn to Order, and the
                        traveller will naturally, for his own security, not indorse them till he
                        receives the money; besides which, such checks are so concerted with the
                        agents as to render a successful forgery of his name scarcely possible.” See
                        Murray’s “Handbook.”
                
                
                    BILLS.
                    Bank Post Bills.—The Bank of England issues Bills at seven days’
                        sight, which require endorsement before they can be paid, and are therefore
                        safe to send by post. Country Bankers also issue Bank Post Bills at various
                        dates, not exceeding 21 days’ date, but Cheques made payable to Order, are
                        generally sufficient for the purpose of remittance.
                    Bills of Exchange, and Promissory Notes, so seldom enter into
                        the experience of the “Unprotected,” that it is unnecessary, and perhaps
                            useless, to explain the technicalities
                        belonging to them in this work. The best plan is to take them to your
                        Bankers at once. I add the respective form of each, and you will then obtain
                        any explanation or information that may be required.

                                On Demand, or — days, or — months after date or sight, I promise
                                    to pay C.D. or order, the sum of One Hundred Pounds and Six
                                    Shillings, value received.
                                
                                    Jane Smith.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    This must be written on an indented Bill Stamp, according to the amount of
                        the Bill. See Stamp Duties on Bills of Exchange in most Almanacs.

                                Three months after date (or any other period of time), pay to my

C.D.(Stamp
                                    as for Promissory Note.)
                            
                        
                    
                
                
                    I.O.U.
                    An I.O.U. is an admission that the signer thereof owes the money stated
                        therein, to the person to whom it is directed, and may frequently be found
                        convenient. For instance, if, in travelling abroad, one’s money runs short,
                        and a relation or friend lends a sum, it is the simplest way of
                        acknowledging the debt. It can be written on a visiting card.
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    London, March 14th, 1863.
                                    To Mr. —
                                
                                I.O.U. Two Hundred Pounds.
                                
                                    Anne Brown.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    An I.O.U. requires no Stamp and is admissible in evidence, because it merely
                        affords evidence of debt, and is neither a Promissory Note nor a Receipt. Be
                        careful to adhere strictly to this form, and not to add more words, for if a
                        person goes on to state when it will be paid,—for instance, “I.O.U. £200, to
                        be paid on July the 10th, 1863,”—the latter words amount to a promise to pay
                        upon a particular day, and the paper must be stamped, as being a Promissory
                        Note or an Agreement. It is better to take a Promissory Note when you can
                        get it, as being more regular than an I.O.U.
                
            
            
            
                CHAPTER III.
                STOCKS AND LEADING SECURITIES.
                
                    STOCKS.
                    Stocks or Public Funds.—Refer to the Daily Papers for the price
                        of the Stocks or Funds. Two prices are often mentioned. The
                            lowest, at which people might have sold. The
                            highest, at which they might have bought.
                        There is little difference from day to day, unless some great political or
                        commercial event has occurred.
                    “Consols,” is an abbreviation of Consolidated Three per Cent.
                        Annuities. If the Consols are quoted at 92? to ¼ it would mean that the
                        public would sell £100 Stock at the rate of 92?, that is, £92 2
                            s.
                            shilling

                            d.
                            pence
                        , or but at £92 5
                            s.
                            shilling

                            d.
                            pence
                         Therefore £92 2
                            s.
                            shilling
                         6
                            d.
                            pence
                         buys £100 Stock, which always will produce 3 per Cent. to the holder of it; or in other words, for each £92 2
                            s.
                            shilling

                        , or whatever it may be, she can get £3 a?year for ever.
                    Remember no transaction in the Stock Market can be effected but through the
                        medium of a Broker, whether it be in Government Funds, Railways, or other
                        Securities. By his aid considerable trouble and time is saved, at a small
                        expense. See Brokers and Bankers, page 34.
                    Investing in the Stocks.—When you wish to invest any money in
                        the Stocks, or other Securities, your easiest plan is to write to your
                        Banker, who will employ his Broker. Suppose you wish to invest £250, write
                        thus:—
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    To the Manager of the — Bank.
                                
                                Please to invest in my name the sum of Two Hundred and Fifty
                                    Pounds in the Three per Cent. Consols, (or other security as the
                                    case may be,) and procure a Power of Attorney for
                                        dividends only (when a Power is necessary.)
                                
                                    £250:0:0.
                                    Anne Baxter.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    Dividends are the half?yearly payments of Interest, on the
                        different Government Shares and Stock. They are paid regularly, but
                        generally three or four days after they become due. The transfer books are
                        shut four or five weeks previous to the day on which the dividends become
                        due, for the calculation of interest.
                    You cannot receive your dividends at the Bank of England unless you go in
                        person. If therefore you cannot go yourself, you obtain and sign a Power of
                        Attorney for your Banker, or any one you can trust, to enable him to receive
                        the dividends for you. After the first purchase, no new Power of Attorney or
                        Letter of Attorneys for dividends is requisite.
                    When you purchase Government Stock, a receipt is signed by a clerk in the
                        Transfer Office at the Bank of England, and countersigned by your broker,
                        and is termed a “Stock Receipt.” This will be sent to you. When
                        you buy Stock, you must keep the Seller’s receipt, at least until you have
                        received one dividend upon it; it is then
                        of less consequence, as the receipt of a dividend shows that the Stock now
                        belongs to you.
                    Power of Attorney, or Letter of Attorney, is a
                        stamped letter (if the sum to be received is above £3), to allow one Person
                        on behalf of another to sell, transfer, or deliver Stock of any kind, or to
                        receive dividends.
                    To obtain a Power of Attorney, write to your Banker, who will procure and
                        send it to you. You must sign the document with your name in
                            full, or the usual way in which you write your signature, and
                        there must be two witnesses to your signature. These also must sign their
                        names in full, or their usual signatures, and add the places of their abode,
                        quality, or occupation. No person under age can be a witness, nor can the
                        husband or wife of the person signing the power.
                    A Stamped Power of Attorney generally costs £1 1
                            s.
                            shilling
                        6
                            d.
                            pence
                        ; but for some Stocks—Bank Stock, East?India Stock, and some
                        others, it is rather more. For sums below £3, it is 1
                            s.
                            shilling
                         6
                            d.
                            pence
                        
                    
                    If you wish your Banker to receive your dividends, it is necessary for you to
                        get a Power of Attorney for him, which is lodged in the Bank of England. It
                        is well then to have it made out for dividends only, else he
                        might sell out your Stock, if dishonest.
                    When parties attend at the Bank, and execute their own Transfers for the
                        disposal of Stock, a Letter of Attorney is not required.
                    A Banker cannot act for any of his customers in the Stocks, without a Power
                        of Attorney.
                    For Selling out of the Stocks.—The most convenient plan,
                        especially for the Ladies, is to write to their Banker, and for him to
                        employ his Broker.
                    Suppose you want to sell out Stock to produce £1,200, you can write
                        thus:—

                                I desire to sell as much of my Three per Cent. Stock as will
                                    produce Twelve hundred pounds. Please procure a Power of
                                    Attorney to sell sufficient Stock to realize that amount
                                        only, and cause the sale to be made.

                    N.B.—Remember, whenever a fresh sale takes place, a fresh Power of Attorney
                        is required, unless you are willing to run the risk of giving your Banker or
                        others a Power of Attorney for the whole sum you have in the Stocks.

                        and Banker.
                    Suppose the Consols are at 93?, you will receive from the Broker (through

                                    To A.B.
                                        Derby.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    Personal Attendance.—In buying into the Government Funds many
                        people (if in London) like to go themselves to the Bank of England. If you
                        prefer to do so, then, after the Broker has given you the Purchase Memorandum, usually called
                        Stock?receipt, you must go with him (even though you are a Lady) to the
                        Transfer Office in the Bank of England, and see that the amount of Stock
                        purchased is entered into the Bank books to your name. You must also sign
                        your name in the Transfer books, by which means the clerks will know your
                        signature. The signing your name is called “Accepting Stock.” The Bank
                        authorities prefer purchasers doing this personally, as it prevents
                        fraud.
                    Signature and Formalities.—In selling Government Stock, write
                        down legibly for your Broker, your name, address, and quality, exactly in
                        the same way as it was entered in the Bank books when you bought the Stock.
                        Your must refer to the same address as, “late of —, —,” if you have removed
                        elsewhere.
                    The Broker will undertake to see that the Transfer is all right. He will give
                        you a plain account of how much Stock he has sold, and what you have to receive. You can then go with
                        the Broker to the Transfer Office, to transfer that amount to the purchaser.
                        It is the Broker’s duty to see that all is done properly; and, if necessary,
                        to identify you as having been the possessor of that amount of Stock.
                    A Trustee can transfer Stock to another Trustee or to the person
                        for whom he is Trustee, on his majority, without selling it.
                    In transferring Stock, Brokers charge ? per Cent.
                    Advantages of investing in the Funds.—The convenience of putting
                        money into the Funds is great, because small savings can be readily
                        invested. If you buy in at £80 you will get 3¾ per cent. on your money; if
                        at £86, 3½ per cent.; if at 92, 3¼ per cent.; and if at £100, 3 per cent. It
                        is advisable to keep your papers secure and unseen by improper persons, to
                        prevent them or their accomplices from applying in your name.
                    
                    Certificates, payable to Bearer.—An Act has been lately passed,
                        authorizing Stock to change their present title into Certificates,
                            payable to Bearer. The transfer of these Certificates will
                        require no Broker, and no formality. They will pass from hand to hand as
                        simply as a Bank?note. Coupons are to be attached to each Certificate for
                        the obtaining of Dividends. The Certificates are to be for £50, and
                        multiples of that sum. Experience only will show the merits and demerits of
                        this newly?proposed scheme. The Act refers only to 3 per Cent Consols,
                        Reduced 3 per Cent, and the New 3 per Cent.
                    Stock Loan.—In lending money to a friend, when you have yourself
                        to sell Stock, in order to obtain the money you wish to lend, make an
                        agreement that it should be a Stock Loan; 
                            viz.
                            videlicet
                         that the same quantity of Stock shall be replaced
                        that you have had to sell out, in order to raise the money. You are thus
                        quite independent of the rise and fall of Consols; otherwise, if the Stocks are low when you lend the money,
                        and high when your friend returns it, you will lose materially.
                    To ascertain the Value of Stock.—The price of £100 Stock is
                        sometimes above, but more frequently below £100; if above, it is called
                            above par; if below, below par.
                    Rule to ascertain the value of Stocks or Shares: Multiply by the price per
                        cent., and divide the product by £100.
                    What is the value of £345 of Stock at the price of 81 per cent.?
                    It is equal to 81 × 345 / 100 Pounds. The calculation may be made as
                        follows:— 
                            
                                
                                £345;

                                —
                                
                            
                            
                                100 )
                                27945
                                (£279 and £45/100;
                            
                         but £45 equals 45 × 20 shillings,
                        or 900

                            shilling
                        , therefore £45/100 is the same as 900/100
                            s.
                            shilling

                            shilling
                        . Hence the value required is £279 9

                    Exchequer Bills are Loans to Government for twelve months. They
                        are issued annually, at which time the rate of interest is fixed. They are
                        generally for sums of £100, £200, £500, and £1,000. They have the advantage
                        of being easily converted into money at any time, and of bearing interest up
                        to the day they were either bought or sold. Government generally calls in
                        the Bills at the end of the year (due notice is always given), when the
                        holder has the option of receiving either a new Bill or his £100 with
                        interest. Holders must not neglect to present the Bills on the day
                        appointed, either themselves or through their Banker, otherwise they will be deprived of the interest till the next
                        opportunity of obtaining new Bills. Exchequer Bills for small amounts are
                        dearer, in proportion, than those for large amounts. Broker’s commission is 1

                    East India Bonds are issued for £100, £200, £300, £500, and
                        £1,000 each, payable when there is six months’ interest due on them. The
                        Bonds are readily marketable, and therefore a desirable investment, if one
                        is likely to want to turn them into cash. They are transformed simply by a
                        Bill, mentioning their letter, number, and amount, together with the premium and interest up to the
                        day of transfer.
                    If they should be at a discount, the discount would be deducted from the
                        amount of the principal and interest. They are payable March 31 and

                    RAILWAYS.
                    When you want to purchase, write to your Banker or Broker, state
                        the Railway you wish to invest in, and the amount. He will send you a
                        statement of all the expenses attending the entire transaction, such as the
                        quantity of Shares or Stock, commission, transfer?fee, stamps, &c. Send
                        him a Cheque for the amount at the date stated on the purchase?note. The
                        Broker, having the money, will complete the purchase, and send you the
                        transfer paper or papers, for you to sign in the presence of a Witness.
                        Return them to him as soon as you can, that he may have them registered at
                        the Railway Company’s Office. When this is done, the Broker will supply you
                        with vouchers, in proof of the Shares having been so registered in your
                        name. Most of the Railway Companies now arrange that their Shares shall
                        represent Stock (a certain number of Shares to £100 Stock). In this case,
                        one document only is necessary for the whole amount.
                    
                    If you want to sell any of your Railway Shares or Stock, write
                        to your Banker or Broker, state what Railway, and the number of Shares or
                        amount of Stock.
                    Debenture Bonds, especially Railway Bonds, are generally issued
                        for an agreed period, which terminates usually in three, five, or seven
                        years, at a fixed rate of interest. It is a convenient kind of investment.
                        The holder of the Bond has generally the option of renewing it, on the same
                        or other agreed terms. The Secretary of the Company will always write to you
                        some weeks before the Bond becomes due, asking whether you will renew on
                        certain terms stated in his letter, or whether you desire to have it paid.
                        If you are willing to renew it at the expiration of the term (even though it
                        may bear a different rate of interest) no new stamp will be required. To the
                        Debenture Bond are attached Coupons, or Interest Warrants, which are
                        generally small pieces of paper a few inches in length: one has to be cut off every half?year and sent to your
                        Bankers, and sign your name at the back. Some Companies require a Draft or
                        Receipt Stamp on the back of the Coupon, and some do not. This will be
                        arranged for you by your Banker. Write a note to your Bankers at the same
                        time (unless you take it yourself). They will procure from their London
                        Bankers the sum marked on the Coupon, after deducting the Income?tax.
                    You can write thus—

                                Gentlemen,—Please send the enclosed to be cashed, and place the
                                    amount to my credit. Have the goodness to acknowledge its
                                    receipt.

                    Some people leave their Debenture Bonds, with the Coupons attached, in their
                        Banker’s hands, to cut off and present when severally due; but it is better
                        to retain the Bond and send the detached Coupons only to your Banker.
                    
                    Broker not essential.—Putting money into Railways, for a Bond or
                        Debenture, does not necessarily require the assistance of a Broker. You can
                        write direct to the Company. For instance, if you have two thousand pounds
                        to invest, write thus—
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    To the Secretary of the — Railway.
                                
                                Sir,—I have two thousand pounds which I wish to place on Mortgage
                                    in your Railway Company. I request you to inform me for how many
                                    years your Debenture Bonds run, and what rate of interest you
                                    will allow.
                                Yours, A.B.My address is
                                    —

                                    pounds has this day been paid by my Bankers to the credit of
                                    your account at — Bank.

                                    willing to renew my Bond of two thousand pounds in your

                                Sir,—Your Bond of two thousand pounds will be at my Bankers,
                                    Messrs. —, in London, who have instructions to give it up upon
                                    your paying the money I have lent you.
                                
                                    Yours,

                    Before sending the Bond to your Banker to present for payment, write the
                        following receipt on the back of it:—
                    
                        
                            
                                Received the within?named principal sum of £—, together with all
                                    interest due thereon.
                                
                                    A.B.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    Debenture Stock.—This is created by Railway Companies to
                        extinguish gradually the debt incurred on Railway Stocks, and ranks in point
                        of security with Guaranteed or Preference Stocks, and is perpetual; that is,
                        the principal is not to be paid back by the Company, but can be sold in the
                        Market like other Shares or Bonds. The interest is payable half?yearly, and
                        the security equally good with the Bonds.
                
            
            
            
                CHAPTER IV.
                SHARES—LOANS—MORTGAGES.
                
                    SHARES.
                    WHEN a new undertaking, such as a Canal, Railway, Gas, Water?works,
                        &c., is about to be commenced, the first thing is to raise money or
                        Capital to meet it, which is generally done by offering Shares to the
                        Public, say of £100 or £50 each. If £1,000 is wanted, the Company may offer
                        ten Shares at £100 each, or twenty Shares at £50 each.
                    At the end of each year, the sum which has been received (if a Canal or
                        Railway, from the traffic on it), after paying all necessary expenses of
                        management, keeping in repair, &c., is divided equally among the Shares.
                        Suppose £500 is cleared at the end of one
                        year, and there are one hundred Shares, that Dividend would be £5 on each
                        Share. If the Company had much traffic, it might clear £6, £7, or £8 on each
                        Share.
                    As the traffic is not always the same, so the Dividends are not always the
                        same, but vary; and should a second Canal or Railway be made, more
                        convenient to the Public, it would, of course, materially reduce the
                        traffic, and consequently the Dividend, of the first; and that would lower
                        the value of the Shares. This is the reason why Shares are less safe than
                        Bonds, Loans, &c. which do not vary in their value.
                    The Shares are sometimes turned into Stock, which has this
                        convenience:—You may buy any quantity, large or small, but you could not
                        have bought a part of a Share.
                    Premium.—If the Share?property is prosperous and the Dividends
                        are good, the price of them will be regulated accordingly, and purchasers
                        will give more than £100 for £100 of Stock—say £102; this is called being at 2 premium. If the
                        market price was exactly £100, they would be “at par.”
                    Discount.—On the other hand, the Share?property may not pay a
                        good Dividend, owing to the want of traffic, or want of confidence in the
                        management of it, or the fear of a rival competition. The Shareholders may
                        take fright, and wish to get out of the concern, and be willing to part with
                        their Shares for an amount under the £100—say £97; this is called being at
                        £3 discount.
                    Shares are influenced by many other causes than the above. Shareholders
                        should not therefore take fright, every time the Shares go down, and sell
                        out, but be advised by some competent man of business before selling out at
                        a loss.
                    Preference Shares.—A Company sometimes wants to increase its
                        Capital. Perhaps the Rail? way or Canal
                        requires lengthening, to reach some other town, and wants money for the
                        purpose. One plan is to create Preference Shares; thus, the
                        Company may fix—viz. £10, or £20, or £50 Shares, and those they
                        do not take are then offered to the Public. The Dividend upon these Shares
                        is fixed, say 4½ or 5 per cent., and is paid in preference, 
                            i.e.
                            id est
                         before the ordinary Shareholders receive Dividend upon the
                        original Stock.
                    The advantage of these Preference Shares is, that even if the concern should
                        not be flourishing, still the Dividend on them will be paid, as long as the
                        net annual income is sufficient, even if there is nothing left to pay
                        anything to the ordinary Shareholders.
                    New Shares and Calls.—Another way adopted by a Company to
                        increase its Capital is by creating new Shares. The Company, having an
                        increasing traffic, wants increasing Capital. It offers to cash Shareholder as many new as he
                        original Shares, or in such proportion as the Company may choose to offer
                        them.
                    Suppose you have two old Shares, it offers you two new ones of £20 each; on
                        which it “makes a Call” of £2 a year, or at such intervals as it wants
                        money, till the £20 is all paid up. You pay the £4 when called for, and for
                        that you are paid at the same rate of Dividend as on the old Shares, unless
                        otherwise agreed upon. Should the Company be remarkably prosperous, you may
                        sometimes sell them immediately, at a good premium: there are cases when you
                        may sell the Share on which you have paid only £2 for £5, viz. £3 premium.
                        You should always accept these promising Shares when offered, if you hear
                        they can be sold at a premium, because you may sell them and make money, or
                        you can keep them yourself, and pay the Calls when they arise. These Calls
                        are useful, to those who save money, as a mode of investment for small sums,
                        both because they bring a better percentage than Shares, on which all the Calls have been paid,
                        and because no expense attends the investment.
                
                
                    LOANS.
                    Another way which Companies have of raising money is by Loans on Debenture
                        Bonds. They want perhaps a large sum at once, to make some great
                        improvement, which they hope by degrees to pay back. They then offer to
                        receive Loans from anybody, for a certain term of years, paying a certain
                        interest, which varies according to the then state of the Money Market,
                        perhaps 3¾ or 4 per cent., which careful people are glad to accept, because
                        of the safety of their principal.
                    The more unsafe the concern, the higher the interest it offers, in hopes of
                        catching the reckless and unwary; but an inexperienced person should
                        consider, that if money can be borrowed by safe concerns for 4 per cert. no
                        one would offer 5 or more, unless they knew their credit was not good. This
                        high interest is often paid out of the capital, as long as it lasts, and when that is gone the
                        whole concern comes to an end, and the lender may be ruined. Where the
                        concern is good, and the interest fair, a Loan on Debenture Bond is one of
                        the safest ways of investing money; as at the end of the term you have the
                        whole of your money back, and the interest on Loans is paid before
                        Preference Shares or any Shares.
                
                
                    MORTGAGE.
                    A person wants, perhaps, to raise a sum of money. He does not like to sell
                        his land, therefore he offers a Mortgage upon it. Say he wants £1,000. You,
                        wanting to invest that sum, lend it to him, at the interest of the day—say 4
                        per cent.; and he gives you as security the Deeds of his Estate, which
                        should be to the value of £1,500 at the least, so that, if he fails to pay
                        you back your £1,000 at the time fixed, you can sell his Estate, and, after
                        paying all the expenses of the sale, find a
                        sufficient surplus to insure the repayment of what you lent.
                    A good Mortgage is an excellent investment, like the Loans; but
                        much care is necessary, and your own Attorney should always
                        carry out the transaction, and should ascertain that there has not been a
                        previous Mortgage raised upon the Estate, and that the person may be
                        depended upon for paying the interest regularly, as you would naturally
                        hesitate before having recourse to legal measures to obtain it. Here, as in
                        Loans, where a higher percentage is offered than is given by the Money
                        Market, you may be sure that there is some difficulty in borrowing, owing to
                        the credit or security not being good, as no man will offer more interest
                        than he is obliged. The Borrower always pays his own expenses, the expenses
                        of the Lender, and the Lender’s Attorney.
                    Buildings, and especially trade buildings, are much less satisfactory
                        securities than land.
                    Lending money on Mortgage requires great
                        caution as to the character of the person borrowing. Unsuspecting persons
                        have often been victimised when all has previously appeared properly
                        done.
                    Suppose Lady A. lends money to Mr. B., on the understanding that the whole
                        money is to be repaid, say at the end of seven years, and that 4 per cent.
                        interest is to be paid Lady A. each year. Now suppose B. neglects to pay
                        interest. Lady A. wants her money; but, too late, she finds that she cannot
                        make a legal title to sell B.’s land. This may go on for years,
                        till poor Lady A. is only too happy to sacrifice all interest due to her, so
                        that she may get her principal again, which is just the fraud this Mr. B.
                        has meditated upon all along.
                    It may be suggested that the Lawyers should see to this. But, in practice, it
                        often happens to Ladies to be quite indignant at the suggestion of their
                        Lawyer, as to the substantial character of Mr. B., who may be a personal
                        friend or a connexion of a deceased husband, and has attracted her
                        partisanship by means of a persuasive tongue.
                    
                    A Mortgage should always contain a power for the Lender to sell in the event
                        of the interest falling into arrear.
                    Title?Deeds of an Estate are the visible tokens of the ownership
                        of the person in whose custody they are; and, when buying an Estate, if you
                        always make a point of employing your own Attorney to carry out
                        the purchase, he will be bound to see that they are either given up to you,
                        or that the person entitled to the possession of the Deeds enters into
                        proper convenants for their production.

                                She has left a space for the answers, and enclosed a stamped
                                    envelope, ready directed to herself, to save unnecessary
                                    trouble.

                CHAPTER V.
                HOUSE PROPERTY.
                In purchasing a House, bear in mind that in calculating the interest
                    you will receive on the money spent in buying it, you must deduct from the gross
                    rent you expect to receive, not only the cost of repairs, the land?tax, the
                    insurance against fire, but the money which would fail you if the House remained
                    unlet for a time. If you employ a person to collect the rent, a certain amount
                    of commission will be required by him, and will be the cause of further
                    deduction.
                In hiring a House, it is customary for the Tenant to pay all taxes,
                    rates, and charges, except the property?tax,
                    land?tax, and public?drainage?tax, if there be any; these the Landlord pays.
                In selling a House, if you employ an Agent, come to an understanding
                    beforehand what is his charge for commission, and have it written down,
                    otherwise you are liable to an exorbitant demand.
                In hiring Furnished Lodgings or a House, be careful to have a
                    written agreement. Have entered into it any window panes that are broken or
                    cracked; the same with all china and table glass. Have written down (if any
                    Servants are left in the House) how much attendance is to be given; how much
                    firing, house?linen, and plate; what notice is required previous to leaving;
                    whether there are any extra charges, and if so, what they are.
                
                Useful Form:—
                
                    
                        
                            Mrs. Jones agrees to let M — a sitting?room and two bedrooms, for the
                                sum of — per week, from this day [or Monday, or Tuesday week]. This
                                sum includes every expense of all kinds. No extras for use of House
                                linen or plate, nor anything else, except for the washing of the
                                House linen and for coals. The coals to be charged as follows: For
                                Drawing?room fires, — per day; Bedroom fires, — per night when
                                used.
                            Either party can end this agreement when they please, giving three
                                days’ notice of their wish to do so. The proportion of rent up to
                                the day of leaving is to be paid, and not to the end of the complete
                                week.
                            
                                Anne Jones.
                                Ryde, 27th August 1863.
                            
                        
                    
                
                A Midsummer Let or Take is the taking of a House from Midsummer to
                    Midsummer. When the Tenant wishes to leave, the notice must be given
                        previous to Christmas Day—in short, six months before
                    Midsummer.
                
                A Lady Day Take requires notice to quit on or before Michaelmas
                    Day.
                Notice to Quit.—When you wish to give notice to quit to a Tenant,
                    the legal form is as follows:—
                
                    
                        
                            I hereby give you Notice to quit and deliver up, on the — day of —
                                next ensuing, or on such other day or time as your tenantcy shall
                                expire, after the expiration of six calendar months from the service
                                of this Notice, the peaceable and quiet possession of all that
                                Messuage or Tenement, Garden and Premises, which you now rent of or
                                hold under me, situate in —, in the Parish of —, in the County of —.
                                Dated the — day of —, One Thousand Eight Hundred and —.
                            
                                To
A.B.
                                (Name, date, and address.)
                            
                        
                    
                
                Arrears of Rent.—When your Tenant does not pay, write to your
                    Agent—
                
                
                    
                        
                            Sir,—I find that Mr. A.B. has not paid his Rent, which became due —
                                last. Please write to him on the subject, and inform him that for
                                the future I shall be obliged by his paying it on the proper days,
                                viz. — and —.
                            
                                To
Messrs. E.F.
                                (Name, date, and address.)
                            
                        
                    
                
                Or—
                
                    
                        
                            Sir,—I am much disappointed at my new Tenant having commenced so
                                early to be in arrear. Please give him a month’s notice, at the
                                expiration of which time I expect the whole amount to paid, without
                                fail, to the credit of my account.
                            
                                To Messrs.
E.F.
                                (Name, date, and address.)
                            
                        
                    
                
                Insurance against Fire, for House, furniture, pictures, &c., is
                    a precaution which should never be neglected or delayed. It must be paid when
                    due, or you forfeit the benefit should a fire take place. If a stove is in or at
                    any time added to the House, it must be mentioned in the Policy. Ascertain from your Attorney or Banker the name of a
                    respectable Insurance Office, and then apply to the Agent, and he will relieve
                    you of any further trouble.
                Appeals against Rates.—The grounds upon which parties may appeal
                    are—inequality, unfairness, or incorrectness in the valuation of the Property
                    rate. (See “Every Man his own Lawyer.” Lockwood & Co. 7, Stationers’ Hall

                Liabilities of Tenants.—In taking a House, it is of great importance
                    to know the many liabilities you incur, as from ignorance a person may be led
                    into much unnecessary trouble and expense. As it is a subject of itself, and too
                    long to describe in a work like this, I strongly recommend those intending to
                    buy or rent, the latest edition of a little sixpenny book, called
                    “Landlords, Tenants, and Lodgers,” by James Bishop; Dean & Son, 11, Ludgate
                    Hill, London.
            
            
            
                CHAPTER VI.
                MISCELLANEOUS.
                
                    MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS
                    GENERALLY consist of the lady’s fortune, and a certain proportion of
                        the gentleman’s, which are placed in the hands of trustees, to secure a
                        small but certain income for herself and children, in case of her husband’s
                        death or bankruptcy. No prudent woman should marry without this provision,
                        as, if it is made before her marriage, however much in debt her husband may
                        become, from extravagance, or misfortune, her settlement money cannot be
                        made liable.
                    The Trustees of a Settlement or Will are responsible for the
                        loss or misapplication of the money
                        entrusted to them, if any is lost through their gross carelessness, and they
                        are liable to make it good. Any one accepting this Office should thoroughly
                        understand what he undertakes, and never act without the advice of a lawyer,
                        particularly when asked to give consent to a change of investment. He should
                        never, on any account whatever, consent to any investment not
                        authorized by the Will or Settlement. He must also recollect that, though
                        entitled to be repaid all reasonable expenses incurred in his Trusteeship,
                        or in taking advice, &c. he can never make any profit by his Office. A
                        Trustee, or his co?Trustee, should have the Marriage Settlement and all
                        Deeds, Share and Stock Certificates, &c. connected with the Trust, in
                        his hands or in those of a lawyer, and never leave them in the husband’s
                        keeping. When so much responsibility is entailed with it, it is but fair
                        that, on accepting the office, a Trustee should be made fully
                        cognisant of what he undertakes, and what his duties are, and as little
                        trouble should be given him as possible.
                        He should be put to no expense of postage or otherwise. When sending him
                        papers, &c. to sign, enclose the right number of postage?stamps on a
                        proper?sized envelope, addressed to yourself, so that he has nothing to do,
                        after signing, but to re?inclose the papers and send them. A Trustee’s
                        office is a burthensome and usually a thankless one, but it is a duty to
                        accept it when appealed to by a near relation.
                
                
                    WILLS.
                    The following instructions should be strictly followed in executing a Will.
                            First, never make one if you can possibly help it, without
                        the aid of a lawyer. Secondly, if there be none to be had, and
                        the case is urgent, the following regulations must be attended to—
                    1st. The date should be inserted.
                    2d. You must then, in the presence of two witnesses, sign the
                        Will on each sheet of the Will (if it is written on more sheets than one),
                        at the bottom of the writing, and say, in
                        the presence and hearing of the witnesses, “I publish and declare this to be
                        my last Will and Testament.”
                    3d. The witnesses should then sign their names and add their addresses and
                        qualities at the end of an attestation clause, which may be in the form
                        following, viz.: “Signed by the Testator as his Will, in the presence of us
                        present at the same time, who at his request, in his presence and in the
                        presence of each other, have subscribed our names as witnesses.” This must
                        be done at one time, and you and the two Witnesses must
                            continue together until every signature is completed. The
                        witnesses must not be the husband or wife of the Testator or Testatrix, or
                        interested in any way (directly or indirectly) under the Will.
                    Executor to a Will is a person appointed to carry out the
                        instructions in the Will.
                    In making a Will, be careful to appoint two or more Executors,
                        for if no Executor is appointed, your
                        friends have to apply for Letters of Administration before they can execute
                        the Will. This is expensive, and must be paid out of your estate. If one of
                        your Executors should die in your life?time, immediately appoint another. If
                        time admits, always get the promise of your friend to act as Executor before
                        appointing him.
                    Intestate.—That is, leaving no Will at your death. In this case,
                        also an Administration becomes necessary, and the Government duty and other
                        expenses are materially increased, to the loss of your family.
                    Letters of Administration will be granted on application to the
                        District Registrar of the Probate Court within which the deceased was
                        resident at his death.
                    Make a Will as soon as you have any property to dispose of. Make
                        a point of reading it over once a year on a stated day—say your birthday. Circumstances are constantly changing
                        which require a corresponding change in your Will. Much injustice may be
                        avoided by attending to this rule. Marriage operates as a revocation of a
                        Will previously made, so if you marry, bear this in mind, and write another
                        as soon as you can.
                
                
                    AGENTS’ CHARGES.
                    In all special matters of business in which you have to employ a third
                        person, such as an Agent, Broker, Commissioner, &c. an inexperienced
                        person should ascertain before employing him what his charges are. It saves
                        annoyance on both sides when the agent’s bill comes in, and prevents an
                        overcharge being made, which it is difficult and disagreeable to settle
                        satisfactorily afterwards. There is certainly the resource of the County
                        Court, but it is not every one, especially when a lady, who likes to appear
                        there to give evidence. Even if they do so, ladies have small chances in their favour, under a severe and
                        ungenerous cross?examination.
                    Servants’ Characters.—Some people keep a small book, in which
                        they enter the Servant’s name, age, and qualification; where he lived last,
                        and when he entered their service, &c. On the following pages, they
                        write the receipt for him to sign. This is very convenient, as it is easy of
                        reference when you are asked the character of a Servant. The character of a
                        Servant should be carefully kept; if a good one, it may be of great
                        consequence to him, as many employers object to give the same person a
                        character twice.
                    Servants’ Wages, &c.—Much may be done by a little method,
                        such as paying Servants their wages at stated times. Quarterly is generally
                        preferred; for instance, if a Servant enters your employment in February,
                        pay him or her up to the quarter at Lady Day, finding out by a wage table
                        (which is in the Ready Reckoner, and also in
                        most Almanacs) what you owe, and then
                        continue to pay at the usual quarters.
                    Each Servant should give a receipt with a stamp, if above £2, and sign a
                        receipt like this:
                    
                        
                            
                                Received of C.D. the sum of £8 6
                                        s.
                                        shilling
                                     6
                                        d.
                                        pence
                                     in full payment of my wages, up to this — day of —,
                                    1863.

                    Servants are entitled to be paid their wages monthly. In the event of
                        Bankruptcy they are entitled to be paid a sum not exceeding three months’
                        wages in full, and have the preference of other creditors.
                    Hiring.—At the time of hiring, in order to avoid future
                        disputes, it is necessary to come to a distinct understanding whether the
                        Employer or Servant provide washing, and whether tea, sugar, and beer, are
                        or are not included in the wages. Also, if perquisites are allowed or
                        not.
                    
                    Agreements in writing for the hire of Domestic Servants are
                        exempt from duty.
                    Book about Servants.—There is an excellent book published “On
                        the Rights, Duties, and Relations of Domestic Servants and their Masters and
                        Mistresses,” by T. Henry Bailiss, M.A. Barrister?at?Law; published by
                        Sampson Low and Son, price One Shilling.

                    TAXES.
                    Income Tax is frequently altered by Act of Parliament: the
                        change generally takes place on April 5th. If charged for Income Tax when
                        you are not liable for any, write to the Surveyor of Taxes thus:—“This whole
                        of my income is derived from sources from which the Property Tax is deducted
                        previous to the several amounts of which it consists being remitted to me.”
                        No person whose income is less than £100 a?year is liable to pay Income Tax,
                        and any one who has an income exceeding £100, but less than £200 a?year, is
                        relieved from all tax in respect of £60 of such income, 
                            i.e.
                            id est
                         if your income is £140 a?year, the tax is only payable in respect
                        of £80. The Income Tax on Dividends is generally deducted by the Government
                        or by the Company paying the same, and if you are not liable to pay, or if
                        too much has been deducted, your way to recover the amount is to apply to
                        the Surveyor of Taxes.
                    
                    The Income Tax must, in the first instance, be paid by the
                        Tenant, but the Landlord subsequently repays it to the Tenant on payment of
                        the rent.
                    Assessed Taxes are Taxes on Horses, Male Servants, Carriages,
                        Dogs, Hair?powder, Armorial Bearings, Game Duty, Stage?coach Duties, &c.
                        The Charges may be found in most Pocket?books, and any information you may
                        require may generally be obtained by a written or personal application to
                        the Assessor of Taxes, residing in the parish where the Tax is assessed or
                        imposed.
                    Easter Dues.—A clergyman can claim fourpence a head, but
                        generally more is given.
                    On receiving a Deed, acknowledge its receipt by return of post,
                        specifying in your letter what it is you have received.
                    Ground Rent, to Redeem.—Multiply the yearly rent by 30, for
                        thirty years’ purchase, add 10 per cent.;
                        you will then find out the sum. When the Funds are low, it is a good thing
                        to redeem it, because you may pay in Consols instead of in money.
                
                
                    CALCULATIONS.
                    Thirty Years’ Purchase.—In reckoning the value of land, people
                        say, “It is worth so many years’ purchase.” Thirty years’
                        purchase is an average value. The meaning of the phrase is, that the price
                        asked or obtained for the property is thirty times its rental.
                    To find the Interest of a Sum of Money—for a year, multiply the
                        principal (which is the money you have invested) by the rate per cent.;
                        divide the product by 100: the quotient is the interest for one year.
                    
                    Example.—What is the interest of £425 for four years at 5 per
                        cent. per annum? 
                            
                                £425
                                
                            
                            
                                5
                                (rate per cent.)
                            
                            
                                £2125
                                
                            
                         This, being divided by 100, is £21 and £25/100; or 500/100
                        shillings; or 5
                            s.
                            shilling
                         Therefore, the interest for one year is— 
                            
                                £
                                
                                    
                                        s.

                            with the Dividend, and the buyer is entitled to it.
                            Cum is a Latin word, and means
                        “with.”
                    Ex?Dividend, or Ex?Interest, means separated
                        from the Dividend or Interest; that is, the buyer of the Stock or Debenture not being entitled to
                        the Dividend or Interest then payable or about to be
                        paid.

                        expired. In England the days of grace are three.

                    Insurance is a percentage paid for protection from loss by
                        fire or other accidents. Premium is the whole annual payment.
                            Policy of Insurance is the legal document which secures the

                        the payment of a much larger sum of money upon the death of a person.
                    Interest is a percentage paid for the use of money. The
                            Rate of Interest is the sum paid for the loan for £100. The sum
                        originally lent is called the Principal, and the
                            Amount is the Principal and Interest added together.
                    Interest, Simple and Compound.—If you lend money for a term
                        of years, with the intention of receiving your interest, not year by year,
                        but in a round sum at the end of the term, there are two very different ways of reckoning what you will
                        get. To explain, by an explain:—If the loan be for £100 for 10 years, at 4
                        per cent., the accumulated proceeds at “simple interest” would be simply 10
                        times £4, or £40. But if you reckoned by “compound interest,” you would
                        receive more. The yearly incomings of £4 might have been invested as soon as
                        they were due, and would have borne additional interest. The first £4 would
                        have been invested for 9 years, and the second £4 for 8 years, and so on.
                        Besides this, the interest of these last sums, small as it is, might have
                        been invested. The amount of compound interest, for any term of years, can
                        be readily calculated by arithmeticians. In the above case it would be about
                        £47, but in 100 years, when the simple interest would have amounted to only
                        £400, compound interest would have become no less than £4,950. A sum placed
                        at compound interest, at 3 per cent., doubles itself in 24 years; at 3½ per
                        cent., in 21 years; at 4 per cent. in 18 years (fractions being excluded):
                            hence the accumulations by compound
                        interest become enormous in long terms.
                    Instalment.—When a Loan is contracted, the subscribers to it
                        are called on to pay certain fixed sums, called Instalments, at stated
                        times, till the whole is paid. It has various meanings.
                    Letter Registering.—Take it to the Post Office (having
                        previously put on a fourpenny stamp), and you will be given a receipt for
                        it. The person to whom the letter is addressed will have to sign a paper to
                        show it has been safely received.
                    
                        Money Order.—This will be granted at the Post Office on

                        When you enclose a Money Order, it is safest to sign only your initials
                            in that letter, lest it be lost, and another person gain
                            the money, by applying for it and signing your name. Of course the
                            person who is to receive the money must know your name, or it will not
                            be given to him.
                    
                    Net means “clear” product; therefore net pro? duct means clear from all outlay.
                        Example:—I receive £80 rent for my house; I have to pay £10 for taxes and
                        repairs; there remains, therefore, £70 net product, or income.
                    Omnium, Options, Time?bargains, Put and Call, and some
                        others, are terms used upon the Stock Exchange, relating to transactions
                        altogether unsuitable to the “Unprotected;” and as I write to and for them,
                        it is not necessary to explain them.
                    Profit and Loss.—A term more applicable to those who are
                        engaged in trade or business than to persons living on their own independent
                            means, or income; but as regards the latter, if any
                        purchases of Stock or Shares, &c. &c., are made, and resold at a
                        higher price than that which was given for them,—or if, on taking Stock at
                        the end of the year, the market value of such Stock or Shares, &c., is
                        greater than that given,—it would be “Profit.” On the other
                        hand, if they are resold for less, or the
                        market value is less, it would be “Loss.”
                    Par.—Original value.

                        extended information is to be had in one published for the use of Brokers. A
                        London Share List, called the “Course of Exchange,” is obtainable for 6
                            d.

                        Throgmorton Street, London, E.C.), or of any respectable Broker, a member of
                        the Stock Exchange. If you require the London Brokers’ List (not the “Course
                        of Exchange”), or a provincial list of Shares, write to your Broker in
                        London or elsewhere, as the case may be, and enclose two or three
                        postage?stamps and ask for one. Your Broker will generally send
                        you a Share List, not the “Course of Exchange,” when required, without a
                        charge. In it you will often see Pm., which is short for
                        Premium, so much extra to the sum paid down. Dis. means
                        Discount.

                    Stock?broker is a Commission Agent, who sells and buys Stock
                        for the public at a fixed commission. All Stock?brokers should be members of
                        the Stock Exchange. It is the Broker’s duty to buy or sell for his principals. He acts as an agent, sees
                        that all is fairly done, for which he gets a commission. It is not
                        considered professional for a Broker to deal in Stock on his own account.
                        See pp. 34, 68, 74, 84.
                    Sworn Broker must be a member of one of the Companies in the
                        City, and have obtained the freedom of the City. He has to procure the
                        signature of six respectable householders to a testimonial signifying that
                        he is a fit and proper person to act. He must also enter into a Bond of
                        £1,000 signed by himself, and find two sureties for £250 each, besides going
                        to other expenses.
                    Stock?Jobber (or dealer in Stock).—They are the medium
                        between the public and the Broker, and always ready to buy or sell at what
                        is called the “turn of the market.” If the Consols were at 87? and 87¼, the
                        Jobbers’ business would be to buy at one price, and sell at the other. They
                        are generally men of considerable standing and reputed wealth in the City. During business
                        hours, they are rarely absent from the Stock Exchange, and are mostly men of
                        great experience.
                    Scrip is from the Latin word Scriptum, something written. Many new Shares are represented
                        by Scrip, or unregistered certificates. Shares of a new Company are often
                        issued as Scrip, as soon as the first deposit has been paid. Many of the
                        foreign Railways continue to deal in Scrip.

                            answer. Bear in mind, that if the
                            person to whom you telegraph lives some miles from a telegraph office,
                            he has to pay extra for each mile that the messenger walks or rides from
                            the office, in order to convey the message to his house.
                    
                    
                        To and By.—These words are used in ledgers or
                            pass?books—“To” on the left?hand page, or Dr. side, and “By” on the right?hand page, or Cr. side; and they are inserted
                            immediately preceding each entry. There is a difference in the method,
                            or form, in which pass?books are made out. London Bankers, and in some
                            parts of the country many Country Bankers, make the entries in their
                            pass?books on the opposite side to that in which they are placed in
                            their ledgers; but a great many Country Bankers make the entries in
                            their pass?books exactly as they stand in their ledgers, and in either
                            case the above words still keep their respective places, “To” on the
                            left and “By” on the right, as shown in the following examples:—

                            party, showing that C.D. & Co. still owe or are “debtors” to A.B.
                            £50.
                        In the last case it means that C.D. & Co. place £100 to the credit of
                            A.B., paid in by or for A.B., and on the other side they place to the
                            debit of A.B. £50 drawn out by Cheque, payable to self or some other
                            party; showing that £50 in their books, of which the pass?book purports
                            to be an exact copy, stands to the credit of A.B. The result is, of
                            course, the same, but “To” and “By” still keep their respective places,
                            as said above.
