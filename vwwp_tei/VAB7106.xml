                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as “type=sonnets”; the rest are
                    “type=poem”. All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. In “Medea,” the
                    scenes are tagged as DIV1. The first letter of each poem is printed as a drop
                    cap. All poems with regularly indented lines have an attribute “rend=indent” in
                    the &lt;l&gt; tag. Indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the
                    &lt;l&gt; tag with values of "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for
                    two tab stops, etc. All split lines are attributed as “type=i” for the initial
                    portion, and “type=f” for the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                    <l>“What should such fellows as I do,</l>

                    <l><hi>Here</hi> is the phial ; here I turn the key</l>
                    <l>Sharp in the lock. Click !—there’s no doubt it turned.</l>
                    <l>This is the third time ; there is luck in threes—</l>
                    <l>Queen Luck, that rules the world, befriend me now</l>
                    <l>And freely I’ll forgive you many wrongs !</l>
                    <l>Just as the draught began to work, first time,</l>
                    <l>Tom Leigh, my friend (as friends go in the world),</l>
                    <l>Burst in, and drew the phial from my hand,</l>
                    <l>(Ah, Tom ! ah, Tom ! that was a sorry turn !)</l>
                    <l>And lectured me a lecture, all compact</l>
                    <l>Of neatest, newest phrases, freshly culled</l>
                    <l>From works of newest culture : “common good ;”</l>
                    <l>“The world’s great harmonies ;”“must be content</l>
                    <l>With knowing God works all things for the best,</l>
                    <l>And Nature never stumbles.” Then again,</l>
                    <l>“The common good,” and still, “the common, good ;”</l>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7106-005"/>
                    <l>And what a small thing was our joy or grief</l>
                    <l>When weigh’d with that of thousands. Gentle Tom,</l>
                    <l>But you might wag your philosophic tongue</l>
                    <l>From morn till eve, and still the thing’s the same :</l>
                    <l>I am myself, as each man is himself—</l>
                    <l>Feels his own pain, joys his own joy, and loves</l>
                    <l>With his own love, no other’s. Friend, the world</l>
                    <l>Is but one man ; one man is but the world.</l>
                    <l>And I am I, and you are Tom, that bleeds</l>
                    <l>When needles prick your flesh (mark, yours, not mine).</l>
                    <l>I must confess it; I can feel the pulse</l>
                    <l>A‐beating at my heart, yet never knew</l>
                    <l>The throb of cosmic pulses. I lament</l>
                    <l>The death of youth’s ideal in my heart ;</l>
                    <l>And, to be honest, never yet rejoiced</l>
                    <l>In the world’s progress—scarce, indeed, discerned ;</l>
                    <l>(For still it seems that God’s a Sisyphus</l>
                    <l>With the world for stone).</l>
                    <l>You shake your head. I’m base,</l>
                    <l>Ignoble? Who is noble—you or I ?</l>
                    <l><emph>I was not once thus ?</emph> Ah, my friend, we are</l>
                    <l>As the Fates make us.</l>
                    <l>This time is the third ;</l>
                    <l>The second time the flask fell from my hand,</l>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7106-006"/>
                    <l>Its drowsy juices spilt upon the board ;</l>
                    <l>And there my face fell flat, and all the life</l>
                    <l>Crept from my limbs, and hand and foot were bound</l>
                    <l>With mighty chains, subtle, intangible ;</l>
                    <l>While still the mind held to its wonted use,</l>
                    <l>Or rather grew intense and keen with dread,</l>
                    <l>An awful dread—I thought I was in Hell.</l>
                    <l>In Hell, in Hell ! Was ever Hell conceived</l>
                    <l>By mortal brain, by brain Divine devised,</l>
                    <l>Darker, more fraught with torment, than the world</l>
                    <l>For such as I ? A creature maimed and marr’d </l>
                    <l>From very birth. A blot, a blur, a note</l>
                    <l>All out of tune in this world’s instrument.</l>
                    <l>A base thing, yet not knowing to fulfil</l>
                    <l>Base functions. A high thing, yet all unmeet</l>
                    <l>For work that’s high. A dweller on the earth,</l>
                    <l>Yet not content to dig with other men</l>
                    <l>Because of certain sudden sights and sounds</l>
                    <l>(Bars of broke music ; furtive, fleeting glimpse</l>
                    <l>Of angel faces ’thwart the grating seen)</l>
                    <l>Perceived in Heaven. Yet when I approach</l>
                    <l>To catch the sound’s completeness, to absorb</l>
                    <l>The faces’ full perfection, Heaven’s gate,</l>
                    <l>Which then had stood ajar, sudden falls to,</l>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7106-007"/>
                    <l>And I, a‐shiver in the dark and cold,</l>
                    <l>Scarce hear afar the mocking tones of men :</l>
                    <l>“He would not dig, forsooth ; but he must strive</l>
                    <l>For higher fruits than what our tillage yields ;</l>
                    <l>Behold what comes, my brothers, of vain pride !”</l>
                    <l>Why play with figures ? trifle prettily</l>
                    <l>With this my grief which very simply’s said,</l>
                    <l>“There is no place for me in all the world” ?</l>
                    <l>The world’s a rock, and I will beat no more</l>
                    <l>A breast of flesh and blood against a rock. . . .</l>
                    <l>A stride across the planks for old time’s sake.</l>
                    <l>Ah, bare, small room that I have sorrowed in ; </l>
                    <l>Ay, and on sunny days, haply, rejoiced ;</l>
                    <l>We know some things together, you and I !</l>
                    <l>Hold there, you rangèd row of books ! In vain</l>
                    <l>You beckon from your shelf. You’ve stood my friends</l>
                    <l>Where all things else were foes ; yet now I’ll turn </l>
                    <l>My back upon you, even as the world</l>
                    <l>Turns it on me. And yet—farewell, farewell !</l>
                    <l>You, lofty Shakespere, with the tattered leaves</l>
                    <l>And fathomless great heart, your binding’s bruised</l>
                    <l>Yet did I love you less ? Goethe, farewell ;</l>
                    <l>Farewell, triumphant smile and tragic eyes,</l>
                    <l>And pitiless world‐wisdom !</l>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7106-008"/>
                    <l>For all men</l>
                    <l>These two. And ’tis farewell with you, my friends,</l>
                    <l>More dear because more near : Theokritus ;</l>
                    <l>Heine that stings and smiles ; Prometheus’ bard ;</l>
                    <l>(I’ve grown too coarse for Shelley latterly :)</l>
                    <l>And one wild singer of to‐day, whose song</l>
                    <l>Is all aflame with passionate bard’s blood</l>
                    <l>Lash’d into foam by pain and the world’s wrong.</l>
                    <l>At least, he has a voice to cry his pain ;</l>
                    <l>For him, no silent writhing in the dark,</l>
                    <l>No muttering of mute lips, no straining out</l>
                    <l>Of a weak throat a‐choke with pent‐up sound,</l>
                    <l>A‐throb with pent‐up passion. . . .</l>
                    <l>Ah, my sun !</l>
                    <l>That’s you, then, at the window, looking in</l>
                    <l>To beam farewell on one who’s loved you long</l>
                    <l>And very truly. Up, you creaking thing,</l>
                    <l>You squinting, cobwebbed casement !</l>
                    <l>So, at last,</l>
                    <l>I can drink in the sunlight. How it falls.</l>
                    <l>Across that endless sea of London roofs,</l>
                    <l>Weaving such golden wonders on the grey,</l>
                    <l>That almost, for the moment, we forget</l>
                    <l>The world of woe beneath them.</l>
                    <l>Underneath,</l>
                    <l>For all the sunset glory, Pain is king.</l>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7106-009"/>
                    <l>Yet, the sun’s there, and very sweet withal ;</l>
                    <l>And I’ll not grumble that it’s only sun,</l>
                    <l>But open wide my lips—thus—drink it in ;</l>
                    <l>Turn up my face to the sweet evening sky</l>
                    <l>(What royal wealth of scarlet on the blue</l>
                    <l>So tender toned, you’d almost think it green)</l>
                    <l>And stretch my hands out—so—to grasp it tight.</l>
                    <l>Ha, ha ! ’tis sweet awhile to cheat the Fates,</l>
                    <l>And be as happy as another man.</l>
                    <l>The sun works in my veins like wine, like wine !</l>
                    <l>’Tis a fair world : if dark, indeed, with woe,</l>
                    <l>Yet having hope and hint of such a joy,</l>
                    <l>That a man, winning, well might turn aside,</l>
                    <l>Careless of Heaven . . . .</l>
                    <l>O enough ; I turn</l>
                    <l>From the sun’s light, or haply I shall hope.</l>
                    <l>I have hoped enough ; I would not hope again :</l>
                    <l>’Tis hope that is most cruel.</l>
                    <l>Tom, my friend,</l>
                    <l>You very sorry philosophic fool ;</l>
                    <l>’Tis you, I think, that bid me be resign’d,</l>
                    <l>Trust, and be thankful.</l>
                    <l>Out on you ! Resign’d ?</l>
                    <l>I’m not resign’d, not patient, not school’d in</l>
                    <l>To take my starveling’s portion and pretend</l>
                    <l>I’m grateful for it. I want all, all, all ;</l>

                    <l>I’ve appetite for all. I want the best :</l>
                    <l>Love, beauty, sunlight, nameless joy of life.</l>
                    <l>There’s too much patience in the world, I think.</l>
                    <l>We have grown base with crooking of the knee.</l>
                    <l>Mankind—say—God has bidden to a feast ;</l>
                    <l>The board is spread, and groans with cates and drinks ;</l>
                    <l>In troop the guests ; each man with appetite</l>
                    <l>Keen‐whetted with expectance.</l>
                    <l>In they troop,</l>
                    <l>Struggle for seats, jostle and push and seize.</l>
                    <l>What’s this ? what’s this? There are not seats for all !</l>
                    <l>Some men must stand without the gates ; and some</l>
                    <l>Must linger by the table, ill‐supplied</l>
                    <l>With broken meats. One man gets meat for two,</l>
                    <l>The while another hungers. If I stand</l>
                    <l>Without the portals, seeing others eat</l>
                    <l>Where I had thought to satiate the pangs</l>
                    <l>Of mine own hunger ; shall I then come forth</l>
                    <l>When all is done, and drink my Lord’s good health</l>
                    <l>In my Lord’s water ? Shall I not rather turn</l>
                    <l>And curse him, curse him for a niggard host ?</l>
                    <l>O, I have hungered, hungered, through the years,</l>
                    <l>Till appetite grows craving, then disease ;</l>

                    <l>I am starved, wither’d, shrivelled.</l>
                    <l>Peace, O peace !</l>
                    <l>This rage is idle ; what avails to curse</l>
                    <l>The nameless forces, the vast silences</l>
                    <l>That work in all things.</l>
                    <l>This time is the third,</l>
                    <l>I wrought before in heat, stung mad with pain,</l>
                    <l>Blind, scarcely understanding ; now I know</l>
                    <l>What thing I do.</l>
                    <l>There was a woman once ;</l>
                    <l>Deep eyes she had, white hands, a subtle smile,</l>
                    <l>Soft speaking tones : she did not break my heart,</l>
                    <l>Yet haply had her heart been otherwise</l>
                    <l>Mine had not now been broken. Yet, who knows ?</l>
                    <l>My life was jarring discord from the first :</l>
                    <l>Tho’ here and there brief hints of melody,</l>
                    <l>Of melody unutterable, clove the air.</l>
                    <l>From this bleak world, into the heart of night,</l>
                    <l>The dim, deep bosom of the universe,</l>
                    <l>I cast myself. I only crave for rest ;</l>
                    <l>Too heavy is the load. I fling it down.</l>

                    <l>Propping the hidden face. The sun had set,</l>
                    <l>And all the place was dim with lurking shade.</l>
                    <l>There was no written word to say farewell,</l>

                    <l>I search’d and search’d ;</l>

                    <l>Much scrawl’d and noted ; sketches on the wall,</l>
                    <l>Done rough in charcoal ; the old instrument</l>
                    <l>(A violin, no Stradivarius)</l>
                    <l>He played so ill on ; in the table drawer</l>
                    <l>Large schemes of undone work. Poems half‐writ ;</l>
                    <l>Wild drafts of symphonies ; big plans of fugues ;</l>
                    <l>Some scraps of writing in a woman’s hand :</l>
                    <l>No more—the scattered pages of a tale,</l>
                    <l>A sorry tale that no man cared to read.</l>
                    <l>Alas, my friend, I lov’d him well, tho’ he</l>
                    <l>Held me a cold and stagnant‐blooded fool,</l>
                    <l>Because I am content to watch, and wait</l>
                    <l>With a calm mind the issue of all things.</l>
                    <l>Certain it is my blood’s no turbid stream ;</l>
                    <l>Yet, for all that, haply I understood</l>
                    <l>More than he ever deem’d ; nor held so light</l>
                    <l>The poet in him. Nay, I sometimes doubt</l>
                    <l>If they have not, indeed, the better part—</l>
                    <l>These poets, who get drunk with sun, and weep</l>

                <l><hi>WHAT</hi>, have I waked again ? I never thought</l>
                <l>To see the rosy dawn, or ev’n this grey, </l>
                <l>Dull, solemn stillness, ere the dawn has come.</l>
                <l>The lamp burns low ; low burns the lamp of life :</l>
                <l>The still morn stays expectant, and my soul,</l>
                <l>All weighted with a passive wonderment,</l>
                <l>Waiteth and watcheth, waiteth for the dawn.</l>
                <l>Come hither, maids ; too soundly have ye slept</l>
                <l>That should have watched me ; nay, I would not chide—</l>
                <l>Oft have I chidden, yet I would not chide</l>
                <l>In this last hour ;—now all should be at peace.</l>
                <l>I have been dreaming in a troubled sleep</l>
                <l>Of weary days I thought not to recall ;</l>
                <l>Of stormy days, whose storms are hushed long since ;</l>
                <pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7106-015"/>
                <l>Of gladsome days, of sunny days ; alas</l>
                <l>In dreaming, all their sunshine seem’d so sad,</l>
                <l>As though the current of the dark To‐Be</l>
                <l>Had flow’d, prophetic, through the happy hours.</l>
                <l>And yet, full well, I know it was not thus ;</l>
                <l>I mind me sweetly of the summer days,</l>
                <l>When, leaning from the lattice, I have caught</l>
                <l>The fair, far glimpses of a shining sea ;</l>
                <l>And, nearer, of tall ships which thronged the bay,</l>
                <l>And stood out blackly from a tender sky</l>
                <l>All flecked with sulphur, azure, and bright gold ;</l>
                <l>And in the still, clear air have heard the hum</l>
                <l>Of distant voices ; and methinks there rose</l>
                <l>No darker fount to mar or stain the joy</l>
                <l>Which sprang ecstatic in my maiden breast</l>
                <l>Than just those vague desires, those hopes and fears,</l>
                <l>Those eager longings, strong, though undefined,</l>
                <l>Whose very sadness makes them seem so sweet.</l>
                <l>What cared I for the merry mockeries</l>
                <l>Of other maidens sitting at the loom ?</l>
                <l>Or for sharp voices, bidding me return</l>
                <l>To maiden labour ? Were we not apart—</l>
                <l>I and my high thoughts, and my golden dreams,</l>
                <l>My soul which yearned for knowledge, for a tongue</l>
                <l>That should proclaim the stately mysteries</l>
                <pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7106-016"/>
                <l>Of this fair world, and of the holy gods ?</l>
                <l>Then followed days of sadness, as I grew</l>
                <l>To learn my woman‐mind had gone astray,</l>
                <l>And I was sinning in those very thoughts—</l>
                <l>For maidens, mark, such are not woman’s thoughts—</l>
                <l>(And yet, ’tis strange, the gods who fashion us</l>
                <l>Have given us such promptings). . . .</l>
                <l>Fled the years,</l>
                <l>Till seventeen had found me tall and strong,</l>
                <l>And fairer, runs it, than Athenian maids</l>
                <l>Are wont to seem ; I had not learnt it well—</l>
                <l>My lesson of dumb patience—and I stood</l>
                <l>At Life’s great threshold with a beating heart,</l>
                <l>And soul resolved to conquer and attain. . . .</l>
                <l>Once, walking ’thwart the crowded market‐place,</l>
                <l>With other maidens, bearing in the twigs</l>
                <l>White doves for Aphrodite’s sacrifice,</l>
                <l>I saw him, all ungainly and uncouth, </l>
                <l>Yet many gathered round to hear his words,</l>
                <l>Tall youths and stranger‐maidens—Sokrates—</l>
                <l>I saw his face and marked it, half with awe,</l>
                <l>Half with a quick repulsion at the shape. . . .</l>
                <l>The richest gem lies hidden furthest down,</l>
                <l>And is the dearer for the weary search ;</l>
                <l>We grasp the shining shells which strew the shore,</l>
                <pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7106-017"/>
                <l>Yet swift we fling them from us ; but the gem</l>
                <l>We keep for aye and cherish. So a soul,</l>
                <l>Found after weary searching in the flesh</l>
                <l>Which half repelled our senses, is more dear,</l>
                <l>For that same seeking, than the sunny mind</l>
                <l>Which lavish Nature marks with thousand hints</l>
                <l>Upon a brow of beauty. We are prone </l>
                <l>To overweigh such subtle hints, then deem,</l>
                <l>In after disappointment, we are fooled. . . .</l>
                <l>And when, at length, my father told me all,</l>
                <l>That I should wed me with great Sokrates,</l>
                <l>I, foolish, wept to see at once cast down</l>
                <l>The maiden image of a future love,</l>
                <l>Where perfect body matched the perfect soul.</l>
                <l>But slowly, softly did I cease to weep ;</l>
                <l>Slowly I ’gan to mark the magic flash</l>
                <l>Leap to the eyes, to watch the sudden smile</l>
                <l>Break round the mouth, and linger in the eyes ;</l>
                <l>To listen for the voice’s lightest tone—</l>
                <l>Great voice, whose cunning modulations seemed</l>
                <l>Like to the notes of some sweet instrument.</l>
                <l>So did I reach and strain, until at last</l>
                <l>I caught the soul athwart the grosser flesh.</l>
                <l>Again of thee, sweet Hope, my spirit dreamed !</l>
                <l>I, guided by his wisdom and his love,</l>
                <l>Led by his words, and counselled by his care,</l>
                <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7106-018"/>
                <l>Should lift the shrouding veil from things which be,</l>
                <l>And at the flowing fountain of his soul</l>
                <l>Refresh my thirsting spirit. . . .</l>
                <l>And indeed,</l>
                <l>In those long days which followed that strange day</l>
                <l>When rites and song, and sacrifice and flow’rs,</l>
                <l>Proclaimed that we were wedded, did I learn, </l>
                <l>In sooth, a‐many lessons ; bitter ones</l>
                <l>Which sorrow taught me, and not love inspired,</l>
                <l>Which deeper knowledge of my kind impressed</l>
                <l>With dark insistence on reluctant brain ;—</l>
                <l>But that great wisdom, deeper, which dispels</l>
                <l>Narrowed conclusions of a half‐grown mind,</l>
                <l>And sees athwart the littleness of life</l>
                <l>Nature’s divineness and her harmony,</l>
                <l>Was never poor Xantippe’s. . . .</l>
                <l>I would pause</l>
                <l>And would recall no more, no more of life,</l>
                <l>Than just the incomplete, imperfect dream</l>
                <l>Of early summers, with their light and shade,</l>
                <l>Their blossom‐hopes, whose fruit was never ripe ;</l>
                <l>But something strong within me, some sad chord</l>
                <l>Which loudly echoes to the later life,</l>
                <l>Me to unfold the after‐misery</l>
                <pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7106-019"/>
                <l>Urges, with plaintive wailing in my heart.</l>
                <l>Yet, maidens, mark ; I would not that ye thought</l>
                <l>I blame my lord departed, for he meant</l>
                <l>No evil, so I take it, to his wife.</l>
                <l>’Twas only that the high philosopher,</l>
                <l>Pregnant with noble theories and great thoughts,</l>
                <l>Deigned not to stoop to touch so slight a thing</l>
                <l>As the fine fabric of a woman’s brain—</l>
                <l>So subtle as a passionate woman’s soul.</l>
                <l>I think, if he had stooped a little, and cared,</l>
                <l>I might have risen nearer to his height,</l>
                <l>And not lain shattered, neither fit for use</l>
                <l>As goodly household vessel, nor for that</l>
                <l>Far finer thing which I had hoped to be. . . . </l>
                <l>Death, holding high his retrospective lamp,</l>
                <l>Shows me those first, far years of wedded life,</l>
                <l>Ere I had learnt to grasp the barren shape</l>
                <l>Of what the Fates had destined for my life</l>
                <l>Then, as all youthful spirits are, was I</l>
                <l>Wholly incredulous that Nature meant</l>
                <l>So little, who had promised me so much.</l>
                <l>At first I fought my fate with gentle words,</l>
                <l>With high endeavours after greater things ;</l>
                <l>Striving to win the soul of Sokrates,</l>
                <l>Like some slight bird, who sings her burning love</l>
                <l>To human master, till at length she finds</l>
                <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7106-020"/>
                <l>Her tender language wholly misconceived,</l>
                <l>And that same hand whose kind caress she sought,</l>
                <l>With fingers flippant flings the careless corn. . . .</l>
                <l>I do remember how, one summer’s eve,</l>
                <l>He, seated in an arbour’s leafy shade,</l>
                <l>Had bade me bring fresh wine‐skins. . . .</l>
                <l>As I stood</l>
                <l>Ling’ring upon the threshold, half concealed</l>
                <l>By tender foliage, and my spirit light</l>
                <l>With draughts of sunny weather, did I mark</l>
                <l>An instant the gay group before mine eyes.</l>
                <l>Deepest in shade, and facing where I stood,</l>
                <l>Sat Plato, with his calm face and low brows</l>
                <l>Which met above the narrow Grecian eyes,</l>
                <l>The pale, thin lips just parted to the smile,</l>
                <l>Which dimpled that smooth olive of his cheek.</l>
                <l>His head a little bent, sat Sokrates,</l>
                <l>With one swart finger raised admonishing,</l>
                <l>And on the air were borne his changing tones.</l>
                <l>Low lounging at his feet, one fair arm thrown</l>
                <l>Around his knee (the other, high in air</l>
                <l>Brandish’d a brazen amphor, which yet rained</l>
                <l>Bright drops of ruby on the golden locks</l>
                <l>And temples with their fillets of the vine),</l>
                <l>Lay Alkibiades the beautiful.</l>
                <l>And thus, with solemn tone, spake Sokrates :</l>
                <pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7106-021"/>
                <l>“ This fair Aspasia, which our Perikles</l>
                <l>Hath brought from realms afar, and set on high</l>
                <l>In our Athenian city, hath a mind,</l>
                <l>I doubt not, of a strength beyond her race ;</l>
                <l>And makes employ of it, beyond the way</l>
                <l>Of women nobly gifted : woman’s frail—</l>
                <l>Her body rarely stands the test of soul ;</l>
                <l>She grows intoxicate with knowledge ; throws</l>
                <l>The laws of custom, order, ’neath her feet,</l>
                <l>Feasting at life’s great banquet with wide throat.”</l>
                <l>Then sudden, stepping from my leafy screen,</l>
                <l>Holding the swelling wine‐skin o’er my head,</l>
                <l>With breast that heaved, and eyes and cheeks aflame,</l>
                <l>Lit by a fury and a thought, I spake :</l>
                <l>“ By all great powers around us ! can it be</l>
                <l>That we poor women are empirical ?</l>
                <l>That gods who fashioned us did strive to make</l>
                <l>Beings too fine, too subtly delicate,</l>
                <l>With sense that thrilled response to ev’ry touch </l>
                <l>Of nature’s, and their task is not complete ? </l>
                <l>That they have sent their half‐completed work</l>
                <l>To bleed and quiver here upon the earth ?</l>
                <l>To bleed and quiver, and to weep and weep,</l>
                <l>To beat its soul against the marble walls</l>
                <l>Of men’s cold hearts, and then at last to sin !”</l>
                <pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7106-022"/>
                <l>I ceased, the first hot passion stayed and stemmed</l>
                <l>And frighted by the silence : I could see,</l>
                <l>Framed by the arbour foliage, which the sun</l>
                <l>In setting softly gilded with rich gold,</l>
                <l>Those upturned faces, and those placid limbs ;</l>
                <l>Saw Plato’s narrow eyes and niggard mouth,</l>
                <l>Which half did smile and half did criticise,</l>
                <l>One hand held up, the shapely fingers framed</l>
                <l>To gesture of entreaty—“ Hush, I pray,</l>
                <l>Do not disturb her ; let us hear the rest ;</l>
                <l>Follow her mood, for here’s another phase</l>
                <l>Of your black‐browed Xantippe. . . .”</l>
                <l>Then I saw</l>
                <l>Young Alkibiades, with laughing lips</l>
                <l>And half‐shut eyes, contemptuous shrugging up</l>
                <l>Soft, snowy shoulders, till he brought the gold</l>
                <l>Of flowing ringlets round about his breasts.</l>
                <l>But Sokrates, all slow and solemnly, </l>
                <l>Raised, calm, his face to mine, and sudden spake :</l>
                <l>“ I thank thee for the wisdom which thy lips</l>
                <l>Have thus let fall among us : prythee tell</l>
                <l>From what high source, from what philosophies</l>
                <l>Didst cull the sapient notion of thy words ?”</l>
                <l>Then stood I straight and silent for a breath,</l>
                <l>Dumb, crushed with all that weight of cold contempt ;</l>
                <pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7106-023"/>
                <l>But swiftly in my bosom there uprose</l>
                <l>A sudden flame, a merciful fury sent</l>
                <l>To save me ; with both angry hands I flung</l>
                <l>The skin upon the marble, where it lay</l>
                <l>Spouting red rills and fountains on the white ;</l>
                <l>Then, all unheeding faces, voices, eyes,</l>
                <l>I fled across the threshold, hair unbound—</l>
                <l>White garment stained to redness—beating heart</l>
                <l>Flooded with all the flowing tide of hopes</l>
                <l>Which once had gushed out golden, now sent back</l>
                <l>Swift to their sources, never more to rise. . . .</l>
                <l>I think I could have borne the weary life,</l>
                <l>The narrow life within the narrow walls,</l>
                <l>If he had loved me ; but he kept his love</l>
                <l>For this Athenian city and her sons ;</l>
                <l>And, haply, for some stranger‐woman, bold</l>
                <l>With freedom, thought, and glib philosophy. . . .</l>
                <l>Ah me ! the long, long weeping through the nights,</l>
                <l>The weary watching for the pale‐eyed dawn</l>
                <l>Which only brought fresh grieving : then I grew</l>
                <l>Fiercer, and cursed from out my inmost heart</l>
                <l>The Fates which marked me an Athenian maid.</l>
                <l>Then faded that vain fury ; hope died out ;</l>
                <l>A huge despair was stealing on my soul,</l>
                <pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7106-024"/>
                <l>A sort of fierce acceptance of my fate,—</l>
                <l>He wished a household vessel—well ’twas good,</l>
                <l>For he should have it ! He should have no more</l>
                <l>The yearning treasure of a woman’s love,</l>
                <l>But just the baser treasure which he sought.</l>
                <l>I called my maidens, ordered out the loom,</l>
                <l>And spun unceasing from the morn till eve ;</l>
                <l>Watching all keenly over warp and woof,</l>
                <l>Weighing the white wool with a jealous hand.</l>
                <l>I spun until, methinks, I spun away</l>
                <l>The soul from out my body, the high thoughts</l>
                <l>From out my spirit ; till at last I grew</l>
                <l>As ye have known me,—eye exact to mark</l>
                <l>The texture of the spinning ; ear all keen</l>
                <l>For aimless talking when the moon is up,</l>
                <l>And ye should be a‐sleeping ; tongue to cut</l>
                <l>With quick incision, ’thwart the merry words</l>
                <l>Of idle maidens. . . .</l>
                <l>Only yesterday</l>
                <l>My hands did cease from spinning ; I have wrought</l>
                <l>My dreary duties, patient till the last.</l>
                <l>The gods reward me ! Nay, I will not tell</l>
                <l>The after years of sorrow ; wretched strife</l>
                <l>With grimmest foes—sad Want and Poverty ;—</l>
                <l>Nor yet the time of horror, when they bore</l>
                <pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7106-025"/>
                <l>My husband from the threshold ; nay, nor when</l>
                <l>The subtle weed had wrought its deadly work.</l>
                <l>Alas ! alas ! I was not there to soothe</l>
                <l>The last great moment ; never any thought</l>
                <l>Of her that loved him—save at least the charge,</l>
                <l>All earthly, that her body should not starve. . . .</l>
                <l>You weep, you weep ; I would not that ye wept ;</l>
                <l>Such tears are idle ; with the young, such grief</l>
                <l>Soon grows to gratulation, as, “her love</l>
                <l>Was withered by misfortune ; mine shall grow</l>
                <l>All nurtured by the loving,” or, “her life</l>
                <l>Was wrecked and shattered—mine shall smoothly sail.”</l>
                <l>Enough, enough. In vain, in vain, in vain !</l>
                <l>The gods forgive me ! Sorely have I sinned</l>
                <l>In all my life. A fairer fate befall</l>
                <l>You all that stand there. . . .</l>
                <l>Ha ! the dawn has come ;</l>
                <l>I see a rosy glimmer—nay ! it grows dark ;</l>
                <l>Why stand ye so in silence ? throw it wide,</l>
                <l>The casement, quick ; why tarry ?—give me air—</l>
                <l>O fling it wide, I say, and give me light !</l>

                        <l>Calm as a carven image. As the sound</l>

                        <l>The pale lips seemed to smile. But when she saw</l>

                        <l>One strong, swart hand and put the twain away,</l>
                        <l>And gathered up the trailing of her robe.</l>
                        <l>I saw the deed, I, Nikias, with these eyes !</l>

                        <l>All is confusion ; from all sides surged up</l>

                        <l>Then sudden came a pause ; the angry roar</l>

                        <l>Then Jason stood erect and spake again :</l>

                <l><hi>MY</hi> Love, my Love, it was a day in June,</l>
                <l>A mellow, drowsy, golden afternoon ;</l>
                <l>And all the eager people thronging came</l>
                <l>To that great hall, drawn by the magic name</l>
                <l>Of one, a high magician, who can raise</l>
                <l>The spirits of the past and future days,</l>
                <l>And draw the dreams from out the secret breast,</l>
                <l>Giving them life and shape.</l>
                <l>I, with the rest,</l>
                <l>Sat there athirst, atremble for the sound ;</l>
                <l>And as my aimless glances wandered round,</l>
                <l>Far off, across the hush’d, expectant throng,</l>
                <l>I saw your face that fac’d mine.</l>
                <l>Clear and strong</l>
                <l>Rush’d forth the sound, a mighty mountain stream ;</l>
                <l>Across the clust’ring heads mine eyes did seem</l>
                <l>By subtle forces drawn, your eyes to meet.</l>
                <pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7106-050"/>
                <l>Then you, the melody, the summer heat,</l>
                <l>Mingled in all my blood and made it wine.</l>
                <l>Straight I forgot the world’s great woe and mine ;</l>
                <l>My spirit’s murky lead grew molten fire ;</l>
                <l>Despair itself was rapture.</l>
                <l>Ever higher,</l>
                <l>Stronger and clearer rose the mighty strain ;</l>
                <l>Then sudden fell ; then all was still again,</l>
                <l>And I sank back, quivering as one in pain.</l>
                <l>Brief was the pause ; then, ’mid a hush profound,</l>
                <l>Slow on the waiting air swell’d forth a sound</l>
                <l>So wondrous sweet that each man held his breath ;</l>
                <l>A measur’d, mystic melody of death.</l>
                <l>Then back you lean’d your head, and I could note</l>
                <l>The upward outline of your perfect throat ;</l>
                <l>And ever, as the music smote the air,</l>
                <l>Mine eyes from far held fast your body fair.</l>
                <l>And in that wondrous moment seem’d to fade</l>
                <l>My life’s great woe, and grow an empty shade</l>
                <l>Which had not been, nor was not.</l>
                <l>And I knew</l>
                <l>Not which was sound, and which, O Love, was you.</l>

                    <l>Most regular, like a lady.</l>
                    <l>Ten years back,</l>
                    <l>They say (at least Ann Brown says), ten years back</l>
                    <l>The lady had a lover. Even then</l>
                    <l>She must have been no chicken.</l>
                    <l>Three months since</l>
                    <l>She died. Well, well, the Lord is kind and just.</l>
                    <l>I did my best to tend her, yet indeed</l>
                    <l>It’s bad for trade to have a lodger die.</l>
                    <l>Her brother came, a week before she died :</l>
                    <l>Buried her, took her things, threw in the fire</l>
                    <l>The littered heaps of paper.</l>
                    <l>Yes, the sheets,</l>
                    <l>They must have been forgotten in the chest ;—</l>
                    <l>I never knew her name was Adelaide.”</l>
