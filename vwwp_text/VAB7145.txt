                    “Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be,
                    And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet,
                    Tempers her words to trampling horses’ feet,
                    More oft than to a chamber melody!”

                TO DORA AND HESTER SIGERSON
                There in the Druid brake
                If the cuckoo be awake
                Again, O take my rhyme!
                And keep it long for the sake
                Of a bygone primrose?time;
                You of the star?bright head
                That twilight thoughts sequester,
                You to your native fountains led
                Like to a young Muse garlanded:
                Dora, and Hester.

                                THE mare is pawing by the oak,
                                The chaise is cool and wide
                                For Peter Rugg the Bostonian
                                With his little son beside;
                                The women loiter at the wheels
                                In the pleasant summer?tide.
                            
                            
                                “And when wilt thou be home, Father?”
                                “And when, good husband, say:
                                The cloud hangs heavy on the house
                                What time thou art away.”
                                He answers straight, he answers short,
                                “At noon of the seventh day.”
                            
                            
                                “Fail not to come, if God so will,
                                And the weather be kind and clear.”
                                “Farewell, farewell! But who am I
                                A blockhead rain to fear?
                                God willing or God unwilling,
                                I have said it, I will be here.”
                            
                            
                                He gathers up the sunburnt boy
                                And from the gate is sped;
                                He shakes the spark from the stones below,
                                
                                The bloom from overhead,
                                Till the last roofs of his own town
                                Pass in the morning?red.
                            
                            
                                Upon a homely mission
                                North unto York he goes,
                                Through the long highway broidered thick
                                With elder?blow and rose;
                                And sleeps in sounds of breakers
                                At every twilight’s close.
                            
                            
                                Intense upon his heedless head
                                Frowns Agamenticus,
                                Knowing of Heaven’s challenger
                                The answer: even thus
                                The Patience that is hid on high
                                Doth stoop to master us.
                            
                        
                        
                            II
                            
                                Full light are all his parting dreams;
                                Desire is in his brain;
                                He tightens at the tavern?post
                                The fiery creature’s rein:
                                “Now eat thine apple, six years’ child!
                                We face for home again.”
                            
                            
                                They had not gone a many mile
                                With nimble heart and tongue,
                                When the lone thrush grew silent
                                The walnut woods among;
                                And on the lulled horizon
                                A premonition hung.
                            
                            
                            
                                The babes at Hampton schoolhouse,
                                The wife with lads at sea,
                                Search with a level?lifted hand
                                The distance bodingly;
                                And farmer folk bid pilgrims in
                                Under a safe roof?tree.
                            
                            
                                The mowers mark by Newbury
                                How low the swallows fly,
                                They glance across the southern roads
                                All white and fever?dry,
                                And the river, anxious at the bend,
                                Beneath a thinking sky.
                            
                            
                                But there is one abroad was born
                                To disbelieve and dare:
                                Along the highway furiously
                                He cuts the purple air.
                                The wind leaps on the startled world
                                As hounds upon a hare;
                            
                            
                                With brawl and glare and shudder ope
                                The sluices of the storm;
                                The woods break down, the sand upblows
                                In blinding volleys warm;
                                The yellow floods in frantic surge
                                Familiar fields deform.
                            
                            
                                From evening until morning
                                His skill will not avail,
                                And as he cheers his youngest born,
                                His cheek is spectre?pale;
                                For the bonnie mare from courses known
                                Has drifted like a sail!
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            III
                            
                                On some wild crag he sees the dawn
                                Unsheathe her scimitar.
                                “Oh, if it be my mother?earth,
                                And not a foreign star,
                                Tell me the way to Boston,
                                And is it near or far?”
                            
                            
                                One watchman lifts his lamp and laughs:
                                “Ye’ve many a league to wend.”
                                The next doth bless the sleeping boy
                                From his mad father’s end;
                                A third upon a drawbridge growls:
                                “Bear ye to larboard, friend.”
                            
                            
                                Forward and backward, like a stone
                                The tides have in their hold,
                                He dashes east, and then distraught
                                Darts west as he is told,
                                (Peter Rugg the Bostonian,
                                That knew the land of old!)
                            
                            
                                And journeying, and resting scarce
                                A melancholy space,
                                Turns to and fro, and round and round,
                                The frenzy in his face,
                                And ends alway in angrier mood,
                                And in a stranger place,
                            
                            
                                Lost! lost in bayberry thickets
                                Where Plymouth plovers run,
                                And where the masts of Salem
                                Look lordly in the sun;
                                
                                Lost in the Concord vale, and lost
                                By rocky Wollaston!
                            
                            
                                Small thanks have they that guide him,
                                Awed and aware of blight;
                                To hear him shriek denial
                                It sickens them with fright:
                                “They lied to me a month ago
                                With thy same lie to?night!”
                            
                            
                                To?night, to?night, as nights succeed,
                                He swears at home to bide,
                                Until, pursued with laughter
                                Or fled as soon as spied,
                                The weather?drenchèd man is known
                                Over the country side!
                            
                        
                        
                            IV
                            
                                The seventh noon’s a memory,
                                And autumn’s closing in;
                                The quince is fragrant on the bough,
                                And barley chokes the bin.
                                “O Boston, Boston, Boston!
                                And O my kith and kin!”
                            
                            
                                The snow climbs o’er the pasture wall,
                                It crackles ’neath the moon;
                                And now the rustic sows the seed,
                                Damp in his heavy shoon;
                                And now the building jays are loud
                                In canopies of June.
                            
                            
                                For season after season
                                The three are whirled along,
                                
                                Misled by every instinct
                                Of light, or scent, or song;
                                Yea, put them on the surest trail,
                                The trail is in the wrong.
                            
                            
                                Upon those wheels in any path
                                The rain will follow loud,
                                And he who meets that ghostly man
                                Will meet a thunder?cloud,
                                And whosoever speaks with him
                                May next bespeak his shroud.
                            
                            
                                Tho’ nigh two hundred years have gone,
                                Doth Peter Rugg the more
                                A gentle answer and a true
                                Of living lips implore:
                                “Oh, show me to my own town,
                                And to my open door!”
                            
                        
                        
                            V
                            
                                Where shall he see his own town
                                Once dear unto his feet?
                                The psalms, the tankard to the King,
                                The beacon’s cliffy seat,
                                The gabled neighborhood, the stocks
                                Set in the middle street?
                            
                            
                                How shall he know his own town
                                If now he clatters thro’?
                                Much men and cities change that have
                                Another love to woo;
                                And things occult, incredible,
                                They find to think and do.
                            
                            
                            
                                With such new wonders since he went
                                A broader gossip copes,
                                Across the crowded triple hills,
                                And up the harbor slopes,
                                Tradition’s self for him no more
                                Remembers, watches, hopes.
                            
                            
                                But ye, O unborn children!
                                (For many a race must thrive
                                And drip away like icicles
                                Ere Peter Rugg arrive,)
                                If of a sudden to your ears
                                His plaint is blown alive;
                            
                            
                                If nigh the city, folding in
                                A little lad that cries,
                                A wet and weary traveller
                                Shall fix you with his eyes,
                                And from the crazy carriage lean
                                To spend his heart in sighs:—
                            
                            
                                “That I may enter Boston,
                                Oh, help it to befall!
                                There would no fear encompass me,
                                No evil craft appall;
                                Ah, but to be in Boston,
                                GOD WILLING, after all!”—
                            
                            
                                Ye children, tremble not, but go
                                And lift his bridle brave
                                In the one Name, the dread Name,
                                That doth forgive and save,
                                And leads him home to Copp’s Hill ground,
                                And to his father’s grave.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A Ballad of Kenelm
                        
                            “In Clent cow?batch, Kenelm King born
                            Lieth under a thorn.”
                        
                        
                            IT was a goodly child,
                            Sweet as the gusty May;
                            It was a knight that broke
                            On his play,
                            A fair and coaxing knight:
                            “O little liege!” said he,
                            “Thy sister bids thee come
                            After me.
                        
                        
                            “A pasture rolling west
                            Lies open to the sun,
                            Bright?shod with primroses
                            Doth it run;
                            And forty oaks be nigh,
                            Apart, and face to face,
                            And cow?bells all the morn
                            In the space.
                        
                        
                            “And there the sloethorn bush
                            Beside the water grows,
                            And hides her mocking head
                            Under snows;
                            Black stalks afoam with bloom,
                            And never a leaf hath she:
                            Thou crystal of the realm,
                            Follow me!”
                        
                        
                            Uplooked the undefiled:
                            “All things, ere I was born
                            My sister found; now find
                            Me the thorn.”
                            
                            They travelled down the lane,
                            An hour’s dust they made:
                            The belted breast of one
                            Bore a blade.
                        
                        
                            The primroses were out,
                            The aislèd oaks were green,
                            The cow?bells pleasantly
                            Tinked between;
                            The brook was beaded gold,
                            The thorn was burgeoning,
                            Where evil Ascobert
                            Slew the King.
                        
                        
                            He hid him in the ground,
                            Nor washed away the dyes,
                            Nor smoothed the falled curls
                            From his eyes.
                            No father had the babe
                            To bless his bed forlorn;
                            No mother now to weep
                            By the thorn.
                        
                        
                            There fell upon that place
                            A shaft of heavenly light;
                            The thorn in Mercia spake
                            Ere the night:
                            “Beyond, a sister sees
                            Her crownèd period,
                            But at my root a lamb
                            Seeth God.”
                        
                        
                            Unto each, even so.
                            As dew before the cloud,
                            
                            The guilty glory passed
                            Of the proud.
                            Boy Kenelm has the song,
                            Saint Kenelm has the bower;
                            His thorn a thousand years
                            Is in flower!
                        
                    
                    
                        Vergniaud in the Tumbril
                        
                            I
                            
                                THE wheels are silent, the cords are slack,
                                The terrible faces are surging back.
                                France, they too love thee! bid that keep plain;
                            
                            
                                The wrath and carnage I stayed afar
                                Colleagues of my white conscience are:
                                Accept my slayers, accept me slain!
                            
                            
                                Shed for days, in its olden guise
                                The quiet delicate snake?skin lies
                                To cheat a boy on his woodland stroll:
                            
                            
                                What if he crush it? Others see
                                Beauty’s miracle under a tree
                                Supple in mail, and adroit, and whole;
                            
                            
                                The sharper rid of a shape, and thence

                                Mounted with infinite might and speed,
                            
                            
                                Freed like a soul to the heaven it dreamed;
                                Over life that was, and death that seemed
                                A victory and a revenge indeed!
                            
                            
                            
                                As the serpent moves to the open spring,
                                The while a mock, a delusive thing
                                Sole in sight of the crowd may be,

                                For what is left at the feet of France
                                It is our failure, it is not we.

                                Not to ourselves our strength we brought:
                                Inexpiable the Hand that wrought
                                In us the ruin of no redress,
                            
                            
                                The storm, the effort, the pang, the fire,
                                The premonition, the vast desire,
                                The primal passion of righteousness!
                            
                            
                                Scarce by the pitiful thwarted plan,
                                The haste, or the studious fears of man
                                Drawing a discord from best delight,
                            
                            
                                The measure is meted of God most wise;

                                Shall speak us false in our dying fight.

                                Disaster’s college in one saved land,
                                Whence many a stripling state shall learn.

                                Close to the vision undestroyed,
                                The hope not compassed and yet not void,
                                We perish so; but the world shall mark

                                With a dawn?cry thro’ the battle’s dark.

                                Take heart, that after a thirst profound
                                The cup of delicious death is near,
                            
                            
                                And whoso hold it, or whence it flow,
                                O drink it to France, to France! and know
                                For the gift thou givest, thou hast her tear.
                            
                            
                                True seed thou wert of the sunnier hour,
                                Honorable, and burst to flower
                                Late in a hell?pit poison?walled:
                            
                            
                                Farewell, mortality lopped and pale,
                                Thou body that wast my friend! and Hail,
                                Dear spirit already! . . . My name is called.

                        Far on the hill, our quiet treetops fade!
                        A broidery of northern seaweed, laid
                        Long in a book, were scarce more fine and clear.
                        Frost, and sad light, and windless atmosphere
                        Have breathed on them, and of their frailties made
                        Beauty more sweet than summer’s builded shade,
                        Whose green domes fall, to bring this wonder here.
                        O ye forgetting and outliving boughs,
                        With not a plume, gay in the jousts before,
                        Left for the Archer! so, in evening’s eye,
                        So stilled, so lifted, let your lover die,
                        Set in the upper calm no voices rouse,
                        Stript, meek, withdrawn, against the heavenly door.

                        GOOD oars, for Arnold’s sake
                        By Laleham lightly bound,
                        And near the bank, O soft,
                        Darling swan!
                        Let not the o’erweary wake

                        But where he slumbered oft,
                        Slumber on.

                            BETWEEN the wet trees and the sorry steeple,
                            Keep, Time, in dark Soho, what once was Hazlitt,
                            Seeker of Truth, and finder oft of Beauty;
                        
                        
                            Beauty’s a sinking light, ah, none too faithful;
                            But Truth, who leaves so here her spent pursuer,
                            Forgets not her great pawn: herself shall claim it.
                        
                        
                            Therefore sleep safe, thou dear and battling spirit,
                            Safe also on our earth, begetting ever
                            Some one love worth the ages and the nations!
                        
                        
                            Nothing falls under to thine eyes eternal.
                            Sleep safe in dark Soho: the stars are shining,
                            Titian and Wordsworth live; the People marches.

                        LET thoughts go hence as from a mountain spring,
                        Of the great dust of battle clean and whole,
                        And the wild birds that have no nest nor goal
                        Fold in a young man’s breast their trancèd wing;
                        For thou art made of purest Light, a thing
                        Art gave, beyond her own devout control;
                        And Light upon thy seeing, suffering soul
                        Hath wrought a sign for many journeying;
                        Our sign. As up a wayside, after rain,
                        When the blown beeches purple all the height
                        And clouds sink to the sea?marge, suddenly
                        The autumn sun (how soft, how solemn?bright!)
                        Moves to the vacant dial, so is lain
                        God’s meaning Hand, thou chosen, upon thee.
                    
                    
                        Spring Nightfall
                        APRIL is sad, as if the end she knew.
                        The maple’s misty red, the willow’s gold
                        Face?deep in nimble water, seem to hold
                        In hope’s own weather their autumnal hue.
                        There is no wind, no star, no sense of dew,
                        But the thin vapors gird the mountain old,
                        And the moon, risen before the west is cold,
                        Pale with compassion slopes into the blue.
                        Under the shining dark the day hath passed
                        Shining; so even of thee was home bereaved,
                        Thou dear and pensive spirit! overcast
                        Hardly at all, but drawn from light to light,
                        Who in the doubtful hour, and unperceived,
                        Rebuked adoring hearts with change and flight.

                            And to so young, so kind a face,
                            The long, protecting grasses cling!
                            (Alas, alas,
                            The one inexorable thing!)
                        
                        
                            In rocky hollows cool and deep,
                            The bees our boyhood hunted sleep;
                            The early moon from Ida’s steep
                            Comes to the empty wrestling?ring.
                            (Alas, alas,
                            The one inexorable thing!)
                        
                        
                            Upon the widowed wind recede
                            No echoes of the shepherd’s reed,
                            And children without laughter lead
                            The war?horse to the watering.
                            (Alas, alas,
                            The one inexorable thing!)
                        
                        
                            Thou stranger Ajax Telamon!
                            What to the loveliest hast thou done,
                            That ne’er with him a maid may run
                            Across the marigolds in spring?
                            (Alas, alas,
                            The one inexorable thing!)
                        
                        
                            With footstep separate and slow
                            The father and the mother go,
                            Not now upon an urn they know
                            To mingle tears for comforting.
                            (Alas, alas,
                            The one inexorable thing!)
                        
                        
                        
                            The world to me has nothing dear
                            Beyond the namesake river here:
                            O Simois is wild and clear!
                            And to his brink my heart I bring;
                            (Alas, alas,
                            The one inexorable thing!)
                        
                        
                            My heart no more, if that might be
                            Would stay his waters from the sea,
                            To cover Troy, to cover me,
                            To save us from the perishing.
                            (Alas, alas,
                            The one inexorable thing!)
                        
                    
                    
                        Athassel Abbey
                        
                            FOLLY and Time have fashioned
                            Of thee a songless reed;
                            O not?of?earth?impassioned!
                            Thy music’s mute indeed.
                        
                        
                            Red from the chantry crannies
                            The orchids burn and swing,
                            And where the arch began is
                            Rest for a raven’s wing;
                        
                        
                            And up the bossy column
                            Quick tails of squirrels wave,
                            And black, prodigious, solemn,
                            A forest fills the nave.
                        
                        
                            Still faithfuller, still faster,
                            To ruin give thy heart:
                            
                            Perfect before the Master
                            Aye as thou wert, thou art.
                        
                        
                            But I am wind that passes
                            In ignorant wild tears,
                            Uplifted from the grasses,
                            Blown to the void of years,
                        
                        
                            Blown to the void, yet sighing
                            In thee to merge and cease,
                            Last breath of beauty’s dying,
                            Of sanctity, of peace!
                        
                        
                            Tho’ use nor place forever
                            Unto my soul befall,
                            By no belovèd river
                            Set in a saintly wall,
                        
                        
                            Do thou by builders given
                            Speech of the dumb to be,
                            Beneath thine open heaven,
                            Athassel! pray for me.
                        
                    
                    
                        Florentin
                        HEART all full of heavenly haste, too like the bubble bright
                        On loud little water floating half of an April night,
                        Fled from the ear in music, fled from the eye in light,
                        
                        Dear and stainless heart of a boy! No sweeter thing can be
                        Drawn to the quiet centre of God who is our sea;
                        Whither, thro’ troubled valleys, we also follow thee.
                    
                    
                        Friendship Broken
                        
                            I
                            WE chose the faint chill morning, friend and friend,
                            Pacing the twilight out beneath an oak,
                            Soul calling soul to judgement; and we spoke
                            Strange things and deep as any poet penned,
                            Such truth as never truth again can mend,
                            Whatever arts we win, what gods invoke;
                            It was not wrath, it made nor strife nor smoke:
                            Be what it may, it had a solemn end.
                            Farewell, in peace. We of the selfsame throne
                            Are foeman vassals; pale astrologers,
                            Each a wise sceptic of the other’s star.
                            Silently, as we went our ways alone,
                            The steadfast sun, whom no poor prayer deters.
                            Drew high between us his majestic bar.
                        
                        
                            II
                            Mine was the mood that shows the dearest face
                            Thro’ a long avenue, and voices kind
                            Idle, and indeterminate, and blind
                            
                            As rumors from a very distant place;
                            Yet, even so, it gathered the first chase
                            Of the first swallows where the lane’s inclined,
                            An ebb of wavy wings to serve my mind
                            For round Spring’s vision. Ah, some equal grace
                            (The calm sense of seen beauty without sight)
                            Befell thee, honorable heart! no less
                            In patient stupor walking from the dawn;
                            Albeit thou too wert loser of life’s light,
                            Like fallen Adam in the wilderness,
                            Aware of naught but of the thing withdrawn.
                        
                    
                    
                        A Song of the Lilac
                        
                            ABOVE the wall that’s broken,
                            And from the coppice thinned,
                            So sacred and so sweet
                            The lilac in the wind!
                            And when by night the May wind blows
                            The lilac?blooms apart,
                            The memory of his first love
                            Is shaken on his heart.
                        
                        
                            In tears it long was buried,
                            And trances wrapt it round;
                            O how they wake it now,
                            The fragrance and the sound!
                            For when by night the May wind blows
                            The lilac?blooms apart,
                            The memory of his first love
                            Is shaken on his heart.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        In a Ruin, after a Thunder?storm
                        
                            KEEP of the Norman, old to flood and cloud!
                            Thou dost reproach me with thy sunset look,
                            That in our common menace, I forsook
                            Hope, the last fear, and stood impartial proud:
                            Almost, almost, while ether spake aloud,
                            Death from the smoking stones my spirit shook
                            Into thy hollow as leaves into a brook,
                            No more than they by heaven’s assassins cowed.
                        
                        
                            But now thy thousand?scarrèd steep is flecked
                            With the calm kisses of the light delayed,
                            Breathe on me better valor: to subject
                            My soul to greed of life, and grow afraid
                            Lest, ere her fight’s full term, the Architect
                            See downfall of the stronghold that He made.
                        
                    
                    
                        The Cherry Bough
                        
                            IN a new poet’s and a new friend’s honor,
                            Forth from the scornèd town and her gold?getting,
                            Come men with lutes and bowls, and find a welcome
                            Here in my garden,
                        
                        
                            Find bowers and deep shade and windy grasses,
                            And by the south wall, wet and forward?jutting,
                            One early branch fire?tipped with Roman cherries.
                            O naught is absent,
                        
                        
                        
                            O naught but you, kind head that far in prison
                            Sunk on a weary arm, feels no god’s pity
                            Stroking and sighing where the kingly laurels
                            Were once so plenty,
                        
                        
                            Nor dreams, from revels and strange faces turning,
                            How on the strength of my fair tree that knew you,
                            I lean to?day, when most my heart is laden
                            With your rich verses!
                        
                        
                            Since, long ago, in other gentler weather
                            Ere wrath and exile were, you lay beneath it,
                            (Your symbol then, your innocent wild brother,
                            Glad with your gladness,)
                        
                        
                            What has befallen in the world of wonder,
                            That still it puts forth bubbles of sweet color,
                            And you, and you that burst our eyes with beauty,
                            Are sapped and rotten?
                        
                        
                            Alas! When my young guests have done with singing,
                            I break it, leaf and fruit, my garden’s glory,
                            And hold it high among them, and say after:
                            “O my poor Ovid,
                        
                        
                            “Years pass, and loves pass too; and yet remember
                            For the clear time when we were boys together,
                            These tears at home are shed; and with you also
                            Your bough is dying.”
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Two Irish Peasant Songs
                        
                            I
                            
                                I KNEAD and I spin, but my life is low the while,
                                Oh, I long to be alone, and walk abroad a mile,
                                Yet if I walk alone, and think of naught at all,
                                Why from me that’s young should the wild tears fall?
                            
                            
                                The shower?stricken earth, the earth?colored streams,
                                They breathe on me awake, and moan to me in dreams,
                                And yonder ivy fondling the broke castle?wall,
                                It pulls upon my heart till the wild tears fall.
                            
                            
                                The cabin?door looks down a furze?lighted hill,
                                And far as Leighlin Cross the fields are green and still;
                                But once I hear the blackbird in Leighlin hedges call,
                                The foolishness is on me, and the wild tears fall!
                            
                        
                        
                            II
                            
                                ’Tis the time o’ the year, if the quicken?bough be staunch,
                                The green, like a breaker, rolls steady up the branch,
                                And surges in the spaces, and floods the trunk, and heaves
                                In little angry spray that is the under?white of leaves;
                                
                                And from the thorn in companies the foamy petals fall,
                                And waves of jolly ivy wink along a windy wall.
                            
                            
                                ’Tis the time o’ the year the marsh is full of sound,
                                And good and glorious it is to smell the living ground.
                                The crimson?headed catkin shakes above the pasture?bars,
                                The daisy takes the middle field and spangles it with stars,
                                And down the bank into the lane the primroses do crowd,
                                All colored like the twilight moon, and spreading like a
                                    cloud!
                            
                            
                                ’Tis the time o’ the year, in early light and glad,
                                The lark has a music to drive a lover mad;
                                The downs are dripping nightly, the breathèd damps arise,
                                Deliciously the freshets cool the grayling’s golden eyes,
                                And lying in a row against the chilly north, the sheep
                                Inclose a place without a wind for tender lambs to sleep.
                            
                            
                                ’Tis the time o’ the year I turn upon the height
                                To watch from my harrow the dance of going light;
                                
                                And if before the sun be hid, come slowly up the vale
                                Honora with her dimpled throat, Honora with her pail,
                                Hey, but there’s many a March for me, and many and many a
                                    lass!
                                I fall to work and song again, and let Honora pass.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        The Japanese Anemone
                        
                            ALL summer the breath of the roses around
                            Exhales with a delicate, passionate sound;
                            And when from a trellis, in holiday places,
                            They croon and cajole, with their slumberous faces,
                            A lad in the lane must slacken his paces.
                        
                        
                            Fragrance of these is a voice in a bower:
                            But low by the wall is my odorless flower,
                            So pure, so controlled, not a fume is above her,
                            That poet or bee should delay there and hover;
                            For she is a silence, and therefore I love her.
                        
                        
                            And never a mortal by morn or midnight
                            Is called to her hid little house of delight;
                            And she keeps from the wind, on his pillages olden,
                            Upon a true stalk in rough weather upholden,
                            Her winter?white gourd with the hollow moon?golden.
                        
                        
                            While ardors of roses contend and increase,
                            Methinks she had found how noble is peace,
                            
                            Like a spirit besought from the world to dissever,
                            Not absent to men, tho’ resumed by the Giver,
                            And dead long ago, being lovely for ever.

                            Our Ladye without Sinne.
                            Now soone from Sleepe
                            A Starre shall leap,

                            The Ox hath husht his voyce and bent

                            And on his lovelie Neck, forspent,
                            The Blessed lays her Bowe.
                            Around her feet
                            Full Warme and Sweete
                            His bowerie Breath doth meeklie dwell;

                        For better than fortune’s best
                        Is mastery in the using,
                        And sweeter than anything sweet
                        The art to lay it aside!

                        Ye Christian folk! your sister great and dear.
                        To breathe her name, to think how sad?sincere
                        Was all her searching, straying, dreaming, dread,
                        How of her natural night was Plato bred,
                        A star to keep the ways of honor clear,
                        Who will not sigh for her? who can forget
                        Not only unto campèd Israel,
                        Nor martyr?maids that as a bridegroom met
                        The Roman lion’s roar, salvation fell?
                        To Him be most of praise that He is yet
                        Your God thro’ gods not inaccessible.

                            What lover of her banks restore

                            Old fishing and wishing

                            At dawn the anglers pass,
                            And follow the hollow,
                            In boughs to disappear.
                            O hush thee, O hush thee! heart innocent and dear.

                            In pious cheer to go.

                            Who had, with most of sight,

                            A misconceived and aching smile,
                            And felt, thro’ havoc’s part,

                            To conquer like a friend;
                        
                        
                            In whom the Commonwealth withstood
                            Again the Carolinian blood,
                            The beautiful proud line
                            Beneath an evil sign,
                        
                        
                            And taught his foes and doubters still
                            How fatal is a good man’s will,
                            That like a sun or sod
                            Thinks not itself, but God!
                        
                        
                            Many the captains of our wrath
                            Sought thus the pious civic path,
                            Knowing in what a land
                            Their destiny was planned,
                        
                        
                        
                            And after, with a forward sense,
                            A simple Roman excellence,
                            Pledge in their spirit bore
                            That war should be no more.
                        
                        
                            Thrice Roman he, who saw the shock
                            (Calm as a weather?wrinkled rock,)
                            Roll in the Georgian fen;
                            And steadfast aye as then
                        
                        
                            In plentitude of old control
                            That asked, secure of his own soul,
                            No pardon and no aid,
                            If clear his way were made,
                        
                        
                            Would have nor seat nor bays, not bring
                            The Cæsar in him to be king,
                            But with abstracted ear
                            Rode pleased without a cheer.
                        
                        
                            Now he declines from peace and age,
                            And home, his triple heritage,
                            The last and dearest head
                            Of all our perfect dead,
                        
                        
                            O what if sorrow cannot reach
                            Far in the shallow fords of speech,
                            But leads us silent round
                            The sad Missouri ground,
                        
                        
                            Where on her hero Freedom lays
                            The scroll and blazon of her praise,
                            And bids to him belong
                            Arms trailing, and a song,
                        
                        
                        
                            And broken flags with ruined dyes
                            (Bright once in young and dying eyes),
                            Against the morn to shake
                            For love’s familiar sake?
                        
                        
                            The blessèd broken flags unfurled
                            Above a healed and happier world!
                            There let them droop, and be
                            His tent of victory;
                        
                        
                            There, in each year’s auguster light,
                            Lean in, and loose their red and white,
                            Like apple?blossoms strewn
                            Upon his burial?stone.
                        
                        
                            For nothing more, the ages thro’,
                            Can nature or the nation do
                            For him who helped retrieve
                            Our life, as we believe,
                        
                        
                            Save that we also, trooping by
                            In sound yet of his battle?cry,
                            Safeguard with general mind
                            Our pact as brothers kind,
                        
                        
                            And, ever nearer to our star,
                            Adore indeed not what we are,
                            But wise reprovings hold
                            Thankworthier than gold;
                        
                        
                            And bear in faith and rapture such
                            As can eternal issues touch,
                            Whole from the final field,
                            Our father Sherman’s shield.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        When on the Marge of Evening
                        
                            WHEN on the marge of evening the last blue light is
                                broken,
                            And winds of dreamy odor are loosened from afar,
                            Or when my lattice opens, before the lark has spoken,
                            On dim laburnum?blossoms, and morning’s dying star,
                        
                        
                            I think of thee, (O mine the more if other eyes be sleeping!)
                            Whose great and noonday splendor the many share and see,
                            While sacred and forever, some perfect law is keeping
                            The late and early twilight alone and sweet for me.
                        
                    
                    
                        Rooks in New College Gardens
                        
                            THRO’ rosy cloud, and over thorny towers,
                            Their wings with all the autumn distance filled,
                            From Isis’ valley border hundred?hilled,
                            The rooks are crowding home as evening lowers:
                            Not for men only and their musing hours,
                            By battled walls did gracious Wykeham build
                            These dewy spaces early sown and stilled,
                            These dearest inland melancholy bowers.
                        
                        
                            Blest birds! A book held open on the knee
                            Below, is all they know of Adam’s blight:
                            With surer art the while, and simpler rite,
                            
                            They follow Truth in some monastic tree,
                            Where breathe against their innocent breasts by night
                            The scholar’s star, the star of sanctity.
                        
                    
                    
                        Open, Time
                        
                            OPEN, Time, and let him pass
                            Shortly where his feet would be!
                            Like a leaf at Michaelmas
                            Swooning from the tree,
                        
                        
                            Ere its hour the manly mind
                            Trembles in a sure decrease,
                            Nor the body now can find
                            Any hold on peace.
                        
                        
                            Take him, weak and overworn;
                            Fold about his dying dream
                            Boyhood, and the April morn,
                            And the rolling stream:
                        
                        
                            Weather on a sunny ridge,
                            Showery weather, far from here;
                            Under some deep?ivied bridge,
                            Water rushing clear:
                        
                        
                            Water quick to cross and part,
                            (Golden light on silver sound),
                            Weather that was next his heart
                            All the world around!
                        
                        
                            Soon upon his vision break
                            These, in their remembered blue;
                            
                            He shall toil no more, but wake
                            Young, in air he knew.
                        
                        
                            He has done with roofs and men.
                            Open, Time, and let him pass,
                            Vague and innocent again,
                            Into country grass.
                        
                    
                    
                        The Knight Errant (Donatello’s Saint George)
                        
                            SPIRITS of old that bore me,
                            And set me, meek of mind,
                            Between great dreams before me,
                            And deeds as great behind,
                            Knowing humanity my star
                            As first abroad I ride,
                            Shall help me wear, with every scar,
                            Honor at eventide.
                        
                        
                            Let claws of lightning clutch me
                            From summer’s groaning cloud,
                            Or ever malice touch me,
                            And glory make me proud.
                            O give my youth, my faith, my sword,
                            Choice of the heart’s desire:
                            A short life in the saddle, Lord!
                            Not long life by the fire.
                        
                        
                            Forethought and recollection
                            Rivet mine armor gay!
                            The passion for perfection
                            Redeem my failing way!
                            
                            The arrows of the tragic time
                            From sudden ambush cast,
                            With calm angelic touches ope
                            My Paradise at last!
                        
                        
                            I fear no breathing bowman,
                            But only, east and west,
                            The awful other foeman
                            Impowered in my breast.
                            The outer fray in the sun shall be,
                            The inner beneath the moon;
                            And may Our Lady lend to me
                            Sight of the Dragon soon!
                        
                    
                    
                        To a Dog’s Memory
                        
                            THE gusty morns are here,
                            When all the reeds ride low with level spear;
                            And on such nights as lured us far of yore,
                            Down rocky alleys yet, and thro’ the pine,
                            The Hound?star and the pagan Hunter shine:
                            But I and thou, ah, field?fellow of mine,
                            Together roam no more.
                        
                        
                            Soft showers go laden now
                            With odors of the sappy orchard?bough,
                            And brooks begin to brawl along the march;
                            The late frost steams from hollow sedges high;
                            The finch is come, the flame?blue dragon?fly,
                            The cowslip’s common gold that children spy,
                            The plume upon the larch.
                        
                        
                        
                            There is a music fills
                            The oaks of Belmont and the Wayland hills
                            Southward to Dewing’s little bubbly stream,
                            The heavenly weather’s call! Oh, who alive
                            Hastes not to start, delays not to arrive,
                            Having free feet that never felt a gyve
                            Weigh, even in a dream?
                        
                        
                            But thou, instead, hast found
                            The sunless April uplands underground,
                            And still, wherever thou art, I must be.
                            My beautiful! arise in might and mirth,
                            For we were tameless travellers from our birth;
                            Arise against thy narrow door of earth,
                            And keep the watch for me.
                        
                    
                    
                        A Seventeenth?Century Song
                        
                            SHE alone of Shepherdesses
                            With her blue disdayning eyes,
                            Wo’d not hark a Kyng that dresses
                            All his lute in sighes:
                            Yet to winne
                            Katheryn,
                            I elect for mine Emprise.
                        
                        
                            None is like her, none above her,
                            Who so lifts my youth in me,
                            That a littel more to love her
                            Were to leave her free!
                            But to winne
                            Katheryn,
                            Is mine utmost love’s degree.
                        
                        
                        
                            Distaunce, cold, delay, and danger,
                            Build the four walles of her bower;
                            She’s noe Sweete for any stranger,
                            She’s noe valley flower:
                            And to winne
                            Katheryn,
                            To her height my heart can Tower!
                        
                        
                            Uppe to Beautie’s promontory
                            I will climb, not loudlie call
                            Perfect and escaping glory
                            Folly, if I fall:
                            Well to winne
                            Katheryn!
                            To be worth her is my all.

                            I
                            IMPERIAL Iffley, Cumnor bowered in green,
                            And Templar Sandford in the boatman’s call,
                            And sweet?belled Appleton, and Wytham wall
                            That doth upon adoring ivies lean;
                            Meek Binsey; Dorchester where streams convene
                            Bidding on graves her solemn shadow fall;
                            Clear Cassington that soars perpetual;
                            Holton and Hampton, and ye towers between:
                            If one of all in your sad courts that come,
                            Belovèd and disparted! be your own,
                            Kin to the souls ye had, while time endures,
                            
                            Known to each exiled, each estrangèd stone
                            Home in the quarries of old Christendom,—
                            Ah, mark him: he will lay his cheek to yours.
                        
                        
                            II
                            Is this the end? is this the pilgrim’s day
                            For dread, for dereliction, and for tears?
                            Rather, from grass and air and many spheres
                            In prophecy his spirit sinks away;
                            And under English eaves, more still than they,
                            Far?off, incoming, wonderful, he hears
                            The long?arrested and believing years
                            Carry the sea?wall! Shall he, sighing, say,
                            “Farewell to Faith, for she is dead at best
                            Who had such beauty”? or with kisses lain
                            For witness on her darkened doors, go by
                            With a new psalm: “O banished light so nigh!
                            Of them was I who bore thee and who blest;
                            Even here remember me when thou shalt reign.”
                        
                    
                    
                        The Still of the Year
                        
                            UP from the willow?root
                            Subduing agonies leap;
                            The squirrel and the purple moth
                            Turn over amid their sleep;
                            The icicled rocks aloft
                            Burn saffron and blue alway,
                            And trickling and tinkling
                            The snows of the drift decay.
                            O mine is the head must hang
                            
                            And share the immortal pang!
                            Winter or spring is fair;
                            Thaw’s hard to bear.
                            Heigho! My heart’s sick.
                        
                        
                            Sweet is cherry?time, sweet
                            A shower, a bobolink,
                            And the little trillium?blossom
                            Tucked under her leaf to think;
                            But here in the vast unborn
                            Is the bitterest place to be,
                            Till striving and longing
                            Shall quicken the earth and me.
                            What change inscrutable
                            Is nigh us, we know not well;
                            Gone is the strength to sigh
                            Either to live or die.
                            Heigho! My heart’s sick.
                        
                    
                    
                        A Footnote to a Famous Lyric
                        
                            TRUE love’s own talisman, which here
                            Shakespeare and Sidney failed to teach,
                            A steel?and?velvet Cavalier
                            Gave to our Saxon speech:
                        
                        
                            Chief miracle of theme and touch
                            That upstart enviers adore:
                            
                                I could not love thee, dear, so much,
                            
                            
                                Loved I not Honour more.
                            
                        
                        
                            No critic born since Charles was king
                            But sighed in smiling, as he read:
                            
                            “Here’s theft of the supremest thing
                            A poet might have said!”
                        
                        
                            Young knight and wit and beau, who won
                            Mid war’s adventure, ladies’ praise,
                            Was’t well of you, ere you had done,
                            To blight our modern bays?
                        
                        
                            O yet to you, whose random hand
                            Struck from the dark whole gems like these,
                            Archaic beauty, never planned
                            Nor reared by wan degrees,
                        
                        
                            Which leaves an artist poor, and art
                            An earldom richer all her years;
                            To you, dead on your shield apart,
                            Be “Ave!” passed in tears.
                        
                        
                            How shall this singing era spurn
                            Her master, and in lauds be loath?
                            Your worth, your work, bid us discern
                            Light exquisite in both.

                            Heroic from the heart it ran;
                            Nor for the shedding of such fire
                            Lives since a manlier man.
                        
                        
                            And till your strophe sweet and bold

                            FRIEND who hast gone, and dost enrich to?day
                            New England brightly building far away,
                            And crown her liberal walk
                            With company more choice, and sweeter talk,
                        
                        
                            Look not on Fame, but Peace; and in a bower
                            Receive at last her fulness and her power:
                            Nor wholly, pure of heart!
                            Forget thy few, who would be where thou art.
                        
                    
                    
                        Summum Bonum
                        
                            WAITING on Him who knows us and our need,
                            Most need have we to dare not, nor desire,
                            But as He giveth, softly to suspire
                            Against His gift, with no inglorious greed,
                            For this is joy, tho’ still our joys recede;
                            And, as in octaves of a noble lyre,
                            To move our minds with His, and clearer, higher,
                            Sound forth our fate; for this is strength indeed.
                        
                        
                            Thanks to His love let earth and man dispense
                            In smoke of worship when the heart is stillest,
                            A praying more than prayer: “Great good have I,

                            Is full of autumn sunset; blue and strong
                            The semicirque of water sweeps among
                            Her lofty acres, each a martyr’s tomb;
                            And slowly, slowly, melt into the gloom
                            Two little idling clouds, that look for long
                            Like roseleaf bodies of two babes in song
                            Correggio left to flush a convent room.

                            In my day, rather, have I seen thee blest
                            With pastoral roofs to break the darker crest
                            Of apple?woods by many?islèd Loire,
                            And fires that still suffuse the lower west,
                            Blanching the beauty of thine evening star.

                            Where the hid spring musically
                            Gushes to the ample valley.

                            Runs, with white throat forward, over the sands to Chalcis!”

                            Soul, remember: and leave a kiss upon it
                            For thy desolate father, for thy sister,
                            Whichsoever be first to cross hereafter.

                            Jaffa ended, Cos begun
                            Thee, Aristeus. Thou wert one
                            Fit to trample out the sun:
                            Who shall think thine ardors are
                            But a cinder in a jar?
                        
                        
                            X
                            Me, deep?tressèd meadows, take to your loyal keeping,
                            Hard by the swish of sickles ever in Aulon sleeping,
                            Philophron, old and tired, and glad to be done with reaping!
                        
                        
                        
                            XI
                            
                                As wind that wasteth the unmarried rose,
                                And mars the golden breakers in the bay,
                                Hurtful and sweet from heaven forever blows
                                Sad thought that roughens all our quiet day;
                            
                            
                                And elder poets envy while they weep
                                Ion, whom first the goods to covert brought,
                                Here under inland olives laid asleep,
                                Most wise, most happy, having done with thought.

                                Cows in the narrowing August marshes,
                                Cows in a stretch of water
                                Motionless,
                                Neck on neck overlapped and drooping;
                            
                            
                                These in their troubled and dumb communion,
                                Thou on the steep bank yonder,
                                Pastora!
                                No more ever to lead and love them,
                            
                            
                                No more ever. Thine innocent mourners
                                Pass thy tree in the evening
                                Heavily,
                                Hearing another herd?girl calling.

                            Praise thou the Mighty Mother for what is wrought, not me,
                            A nameless nothing?caring head asleep against her knee.

                        On First Entering Westminster Abbey
                        
                            THABOR of England! since my light is short
                            And faint, O rather by the sun anew
                            Of timeless passion set my dial true,
                            That with thy saints and thee I may consort,
                            And wafted in the calm Chaucerian port
                            Of poets, seem a little sail long due,
                            And be as one the call of memory drew
                            Unto the saddle void since Agincourt!
                        
                        
                            Not now for secular love’s unquiet lease
                            Receive my soul, who rapt in thee erewhile
                            Hath broken tryst with transitory things;
                            But seal with her a marriage and a peace
                            Eternal, on thine Edward’s holy isle,
                            Above the stormy sea of ending kings.
                        
                    
                    
                        Fog
                        
                            LIKE bodiless water passing in a sigh,
                            Thro’ palsied streets the fatal shadows flow,
                            And in their sharp disastrous undertow
                            Suck in the morning sun, and all the sky.
                            The towery vista sinks upon the eye,
                            As if it heard the Hebrew bugles blow,
                            Black and dissolved; nor could the founders know
                            How what was built so bright should daily die.
                        
                        
                            Thy mood with man’s is broken and blent in,
                            City of Stains! and ache of thought doth drown
                            
                            The primitive light in which thy life began;
                            Great as thy dole is, smirchèd with his sin,
                            Greater and elder yet the love of man
                            Full in thy look, tho’ the dark visor’s down.
                        
                    
                    
                        St. Peter?ad?Vincula
                        
                            TOO well I know, pacing the place of awe,
                            Three queens, young save in trouble, moulder by;
                            More in his halo, Monmouth’s mocking eye,
                            The eagle Essex in a harpy’s claw;
                            Seymour and Dudley, and stout heads that saw
                            Sundown of Scotland: how with treasons lie
                            White martyrdoms; rank in a company
                            Breaker and builder of the eternal law.
                        
                        
                            Oft as I come, the hateful garden?row
                            Of ruined roses hanging from the stem,
                            Where winds of old defeat yet batter them,
                            Infects me: suddenly must I depart,
                            Ere thought of men’s injustice then and now
                            Add to these aisles one other broken heart.
                        
                    
                    
                        Strikers in Hyde Park
                        
                            A WOOF reversed the fatal shuttles weave,
                            How slow! but never once they slip the thread
                            Hither, upon the Georgian idlers’ tread,
                            Up spacious ways the lindens interleave,
                            
                            Clouding the royal air since yester?eve,
                            Come men bereft of time and scant of bread,
                            Loud, who were dumb, immortal, who were dead,
                            Thro’ the cowed world their kingdom to retrieve.
                        
                        
                            What ails thee, England? Altar, mart, and grange
                            Dream of the knife by night; not so, not so
                            The clear Republic waits the general throe,
                            Along her noonday mountains’ open range.
                            Gods be with both! for one is young to know
                            The other’s rote of evil and of change.

                            THE cry is at thy gates, thou darling ground,
                            Again; for oft ere now thy children went
                            Beggared and wroth, and parting greeting sent
                            Some red old alley with a dial crowned;
                            Some house of honor, in a glory bound
                            With lives and deaths of spirits excellent;
                            Some tree rude?taken from his kingly tent
                            Hard by a little fountain’s friendly sound.
                        
                        
                            O for Virginius’ hand, if only that
                            Maintain the whole, and spoil these spoilings soon!
                            Better the scowling Strand should lose, alas,
                            Her peopled oasis, and where it was
                            All mournful in the cleared quadrangle sat
                            Echo, and ivy, and the loitering moon.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Lights of London
                        
                            THE evenfall, so slow on hills, hath shot
                            Far down into the valley’s cold extreme,
                            Untimely midnight; spire and roof and stream
                            Like fleeing spectres, shudder and are not.
                            The Hampstead hollies, from their sylvan plot
                            Yet cloudless, lean to watch as in a dream,
                            From chaos climb with many a sudden gleam,
                            London, one moment fallen and forgot.
                        
                        
                            Her booths begin to flare; and gases bright
                            Prick door and window; all her streets obscure
                            Sparkle and swarm with nothing true nor sure,
                            Full as a marsh of mist and winking light;
                            Heaven thickens over, Heaven that cannot cure
                            Her tear by day, her fevered smile by night.
                        
                    
                    
                        Doves
                        
                            AH, if man’s boast and man’s advance be vain,
                            And yonder bells of Bow, loud?echoing home,
                            And the lone Tree foreknow it, and the Dome,
                            The monstrous island of the middle main;
                            If each inheritor must sink again
                            Under his sires, as falleth where it clomb
                            Back on the gone wave the disheartened foam? —
                            I crossed Cheapside, and this was in my brain.
                        
                        
                            What folly lies in forecasts and in fears!
                            Like a wide laughter sweet and opportune,
                            
                            Wet from the fount, three hundred doves of Paul’s
                            Shook their warm wings, drizzling the golden noon,
                            And in their rain?cloud vanished up the walls.
                            “God keeps,” I said, “our little flock of years.”
                        
                    
                    
                        In the Reading Room of the British Museum
                        
                            PRAISED be the moon of books! that doth above
                            A world of men, the fallen Past behold,
                            And fill the spaces else so void and cold
                            To make a very heaven again thereof;
                            As when the sun is set behind a grove,
                            And faintly unto nether ether rolled,
                            All night his whiter image and his mould
                            Grows beautiful with looking on her love.
                        
                        
                            Thou therefore, moon of so divine a ray,
                            Lend to our steps both fortitude and light!
                            Feebly along a venerable way
                            They climb the infinite, or perish quite;
                            Nothing are days and deeds to such as they,
                            While in this liberal house thy face is bright.
                        
                    
                    
                        Sunday Chimes in the City
                        
                            ACROSS the bridge, where in the morning blow
                            The wrinkled tide turns homeward, and is fain
                            Homeward to drag the black sea?goer’s chain,
                            And the long yards by Dowgate dipping low;
                            
                            Across dispeopled ways, patient and slow,
                            Saint Magnus and Saint Dunstan call in vain:
                            From Wren’s forgotten belfries, in the rain,
                            Down the blank wharves the dropping octaves go.
                        
                        
                            Forbid not these! Tho’ no man heed, they shower
                            A subtle beauty on the empty hour,
                            From all their dark throats aching and out?blown;
                            Aye in the prayerless places welcome most,
                            Like the last gull that up a naked coast
                            Deploys her white and steady wing, alone.
                        
                    
                    
                        A Porch in Belgravia
                        
                            WHEN, after dawn, the lordly houses hide
                            Till you fall foul of it, some piteous guest,
                            Some girl the damp stones gather to their breast,
                            Her gold hair rough, her rebel garment wide,
                            Who sleeps, with all that luck and life denied
                            Camped round, and dreams how seaward and southwest
                            Blue over Devon farms the smoke?rings rest,
                            And sheep and lambs ascend the lit hillside,
                        
                        
                            Dear, of your charity, speak low, step soft,
                            Pray for a sinner. Planet?like and still,
                            Best hearts of all are sometimes set aloft
                            
                            Only to see and pass, nor yet deplore
                            Even Wrong itself, crowned Wrong inscrutable,
                            Which cannot not have been for evermore.
                        
                    
                    
                        York Stairs
                        
                            MANY a musing eye returns to thee,
                            Against the lurid street disconsolate,
                            Who kept in green domains thy bridal state,
                            With young tide?waters leaping at thy knee;
                            And lest the ravening smoke, and enmity,
                            Corrode thee quite, thy lover sighs, and straight
                            Desires thee safe afar, too graceful gate!
                            Throned on a terrace of the Boboli.
                        
                        
                            Nay, nay, thy use is here. Stand queenly thus
                            Till the next fury; teach the time and us
                            Leisure and will to draw a serious breath:
                            Not wholly where thou art the soul is cowed,
                            Nor the fooled capital proclaims aloud
                            Barter is god, while Beauty perisheth.
                        
                    
                    
                        In the Docks
                        
                            WHERE the bales thunder till the day is done,
                            And the wild sounds with wilder odors cope;
                            Where over crouching sail and coiling rope,
                            Lascar and Moor along the gangway run;
                            Where stifled Thames spreads in the pallid sun,
                            A hive of anarchy from slope to slope;
                            
                            Flag of my birth, my liberty, my hope,
                            I see thee at the masthead, joyous one!
                        
                        
                            O thou good guest! So oft as, young and warm,
                            To the home?wind thy hoisted colors bound,
                            Away, away from this too thoughtful ground,
                            Sated with human trespass and despair,
                            Thee only, from the desert, from the storm,
                            A sick mind follows into Eden air.
